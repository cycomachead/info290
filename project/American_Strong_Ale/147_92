3.78,-9.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.75,"Overall: This is an average strong ale for me. The aromas had some promise but i was disappointed in the taste. Theres not enough malt to balance out the hops. I thinks its too hoppy and bitter for the style. I really enjoy a few of Stones' IPAs but i personally feel they are a bit overrated as a whole. Ill probably pass on this one from now on. Cant really go wrong at $5 a bomber though","Bone53","Monday at 08:44 PM"

I like Stone; after all, they do hops, and they do it well. Getting a lot of fresh-baked bread and sugary sweetness on the nose. A bit like raisin bread, but very subdued. Not overwhelming; simply complimentary. Taste follows the nose, but there's unmistakable citrus hops on the finish. On the real. A bit prickly on the tongue, while not being exhausting or heavy on the mouthfeel. There's a fine line between arrogance and supreme confidence. Stone knew what they were doing with this one. I haven't been this excited while drinking a non-IPA since the last time I saw Lorna Morgan rocking some tasteful lingerie. Larrrrrrge!","weiserr","Feb 09, 2015"

4.19,0.7,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Bomber enjoyed in a Lagunitas mason jar glass. The label is frankly awesome, "yellow beer drinker" insulting arrogance at its finest. The beer is a murky opaque reddish brown with a comfortable two fingers of notably dark yellow-tan creamy head. Makes me think smoky bar room. Aroma is well-toasted grains, resinous peppery and citrus rind hops, a whiff of raisins, fruity pipe tobacco, aromatic alcohol. Somehow strikes dark/malty and fresh/fruity chords at the same time. The palate starts with bitter spicy hops, some grapefruit peel and flower water, and quickly transitions to nutty toasted malts surprising devoid of toffee or caramel flavors (although these are down there in the mix). A grainy bitterness like burnt Ovaltine and graham crackers coupled with hints of chocolate and walnut. Ample alcohol flavor but this is skillfully done by design. I am getting some peach and more floral notes late. Perhaps a little coffee. Could be the most adept use of fusel alcohols I've yet to sample. Producing a nice warmth about two-thirds through but no (or little) hop burn. Despite these big flavors, the brew is silky smooth yet still rather thick. Caresses the palate. The heavy malts persist all the way through into the finish, which seems astonishingly dry for such a malty brew. The hops are the coda as well as the intro. Has to be experienced to be believed and obviously I'd snag any variants that should enter this still nascent but fortunately growing craft beer market. A near religious experience, on par with Ruination or nearly so.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 05, 2014"

A 3.75 rating because it hits everything it's supposed to but that West Coast purposeful hop attack really isn't my favorite thing in the world. Worth a try and a great brewery to go visit!","Webbey","Sep 09, 2014"

I cant think of a time where this would serve a purpose that an IPA could not fill in.  Never the less a good impression for me from Stone as this is my first offering from them, and I look forward to some of their others.","ArchimedesSox","Sep 07, 2014"

Overall, I thought the hop flavors were kept within bounds and the brew possessed a balance that perhaps was lacking one or two previous samplings. I bought the bomber for $4.79, which was marked down about a dollar, and a very good deal.","archyquaffer","Aug 07, 2014"

My comments strong, dark twisted flavour, very hoppy, with a spicy aftertaste. I think this beer is an ideal example of the Californian search for a hop texture in beer. Although not an IPA this beer boasts enough to join the ranks of that style.","SamKetchum","Jul 19, 2014"

It has pronounced hops that gets overwhelmed by strong toasted, almost burnt, malt. It leaves a lingering aftertaste that definitely reminds me of a strong stout (not that mother's milk Guinness but more like Bell's Expedition Stout). I know it's not a Stout but the taste and aftertaste sure reminds me of one. It has a decent taste going down, a lot of flavor, not for your Lite drinkers. While there is a lot of taste in every sip, I have had better tasting brew. I was given 3 bottles of this Bastard, I'll finish them but I'm not sure I'll be buying it. At 7.2 abv, this is no slouch.","riverlen","Jul 06, 2014"

The color is reddish orange with a thick white head that leaves trails down the glass. The smell was mostly slightly sweet with a little bit of hop but very understated, The taste is great with simple hop bitter notes in the beginning leading to semi sweet malt and almost a coffee/tobacco aftertaste. Absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 19, 2014"

It's hoppy with a citrus piney knockout. great american strong red ale. I would buy this again. For something in between an IPA and a American ale this fits the build just right. I love how the bottle says "you're not worthy" and this is an aggressive beer "you probably wont like". I like it, and it's great for those in between nights.","Ohiolager","Apr 16, 2014"

The biggest knock against it is the beer lacks any real aroma. For what it lacks in smell though, it does a bang up job with the flavor profile. So crisp and malty up front that you don't really even notice the bitter bite till a few seconds later on the back of your pallet. For its price and how main stream it is, a very nice go-to. . .","Valley_Town_Sipper","Apr 16, 2014"

Maybe this was because the funny label and crazy bragging on the back of the bottle caused me to think this would be wicked strong, oh and the name. Read the label on the back though, it is funny. This is a very smooth beer and really is not a hop explosion, when compared to most IPA's. Not near as strong as Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale (their black ale). That is because it is not an IPA, so it is much more malty. Nice and complex beer. Try it if you're worthy haha.","PA-hunter","Apr 10, 2014"

Highly hopped with IPA quality hop flavor, but an amped up malt character that has a unique flavor profile I have never had in another beer. This is a great, if not the best, example of the american strong ale style that I have had yet. I have probably over-rated this compared to my BA peers, but to me, overall this is perfect.","MaineBrewing","Apr 09, 2014"

It smells like piney hops but with a huge malt presence: I get brown sugar, toasted oats, and some dark fruit notes. It has a bitter pine needle taste from the beginning of the tongue until the end and leaves the back of the throat tingling. Alongside the hoppy flavors, there's a caramel malt with hints of indistinct dark fruits.There's a dichotomy in this beer and the hoppy characteristics don't work well with the malty ones. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation.","itsscience","Apr 07, 2014"

4.1,-1.4,4.75,4,4,4,4.25,"Poured a deep amber color with a big pillowy head. This is a very good looking beer. The head is exclellent and the color of deep redish amber is beautiful. Its listed as a "American Stong Ale", but this beer is pretty unique in its own right. For me, its hard to classify. An amber ale with a lot more hops and more of a biscuty, malty taste to it with the lingering aftertaste of booze...that would be a start but it still doesnt do it justice. Its pretty damn complex. Its really delicious. A very heavy brew, I could only drink a pint of this personally, but its a very very tasty pint. Purchased at 7-11 in San Diego. Tells you something about the SD beer scene if the 7'11's are stocking these bad boys :)","theteleman","Mar 28, 2014"

4.17,0.2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured a rich, transparent reddish brown with a half-finger off-white head, receding to an off-white ring leaving some lacing at the top of the glass. Rich, gorgeous color but a little low on the head. Scents of caramel, toffee, some brown sugar, more prominent as the beer warms, light grapefruit and other citrus, fruity esters, a hit of alcohol and a bit of toasted malt. Quite nice, but not near as hop forward as I expected, more malt and alcohol. Flavor begins quite bitter, with far more hop character than the aroma betrays. Hop character is mostly pine resin, but with some citrus peel bitterness. High hop bitterness is balanced by a malt backbone with caramel and toasted malt flavors. Towards the middle and end of the sip there is a bit of brown sugar appearing alongside the other flavors and some flavors of alcohol. Alcohol becomes more prominent as the beer warms. Aftertaste is bitter, with some grainy and toasted flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly sticky and semi-drying with low carbonation. Very easy to drink, maybe a little light bodied. Overall a good, fairly complex strong ale. The hop bitterness is very high balancing the sweet malt flavors. Pretty good, however I prefer Double Bastard.","Auraan","Dec 26, 2013"

It's good to try at least once. If you're looking for a strong beer then definitely go with this one.","titty_mcbitty","Dec 24, 2013"

Fortunately, Stone has a wide-ranging distribution, and most of the Continental United States (Gawd Bless Amurikuh!) can enjoy this enjoyable beer.","Foamicron","Dec 22, 2013"

The label states “It is quite doubtful that you have the taste of sophistication to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth,” and I was beginning to believe them! I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I finished the first glass and slowly poured the rest of the bottle with growing dread. By now the beer had begun to warm a bit as I left it out of the refrigerator. As it warmed, Arrogant Bastard took on a much smoother more balanced taste as the malts began to balance out the hop bitterness with a more roasty almost toffee flavor. I easily finished glass #2 and completely erased my earlier disappointment. This is definitely an aggressive and sophisticated beer as the label suggests, and a very good, highly recommended introduction to Stone. Just let it warm a little first.","brurevu","Dec 19, 2013"

The smell was mainly piney hops with some sweet malt. The taste was piney hops and sweet caramel malt with balancing bitterness. The finish was long, hoppy and bitter. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and medium body. Overall this is a very good, hoppy beer, and should be tried by any hop-lovers.","afinepilsner","Nov 09, 2013"

I've only had a few bottles, but it's already one of my favorites. If I'm sampling several different beers, I try to stick AB towards the end, as many beers seem mild compared to ABs...arrogance, for lack of a better term. I'll admit, I may be new to the whole beer review thing, but even I can tell where Stone was going with this.","freakdiablo","Nov 03, 2013"

Both are strong and balanced, but sharp at the same time. I'll have to get a little fresher version of this sometime, might be on the edge of starting to fade, hop-wise.

Smell is very potent and powerful with equal part resiny, herbal hops and dark malts; dried fruit, prunes, leather, botanicals, pine and resin. The taste is bitter, dark and satisfying with a burnt sugar, caramel, toast, roasted cereal grains and black coffee, offset by earthy and resinous hop character, ending astringent and slightly drying. It sits heavily in the mouth, coating; medium carbonation that is completely fitting. This beer is good to the last drop, a combination of IPA, amber ale and Imperial stout in my opinion. It's a classic that has stood the test of time and one that I come back to over and over again.","Aaron_Ramson","Oct 18, 2013"

The brew's strongpoint being its nice balanced aroma of fine malts and an amazing pour. The brew is very strong, pungent and acidic in a good way and leaves a great aftertaste that sticks for a while. A very worthy brew and as always, many thanks to Stone, who are easily one of the better American breweries.","ronniebruner","Sep 07, 2013"

It wasn't even a typical craft brew. My initial response to a Stone Brewing Company product was "Wow, I think this might be the best beer I've ever tasted!". That was the Stone IPA. This is my first try of Arrogant Bastard Ale and after my taste buds stopped screaming "Uncle!", my response was "Ahh, Seven Hells, that's good!!". The first thing that caught my attention was smell. I knew then that Fate, that sultry mistress with the warm hand and sensible footwear had pushed us together and I was truly in for a treat. The rich head on this beer is the equivalent of a steak dinner at the Buckhorn Exchange. Once the beer hits your tongue it's like a cacophony of flavors. It takes your mind a few seconds to catch up with it. This beer is almost too good. I finished feeling like I had done something elicit, you know, like after you just get done watching a bunch of midget porn, it might be a little messed up but your completely sated.","Moe_Rhaun","Aug 31, 2013"

For roughly seven to eight bucks a bottle at your local spot definitely beyond well worth it. I like it's big brother(Double Bastard) a little better but every beer has it's occasion.

4.6,10.6,4.75,4,5,4,4.75,"Growing up in San Diego and going to Cal State San Marcos, Stone has been a staple in my life. There once was a time back in my freshman year of college (2002) when I was not worthy. My Fraternity insisted on kegs of arrogant bastard and my palate was not adept to the wonderfulness that is this beer. These days all I got to say is damn I love this beer. Over the past decade I have always looked forward the to malty, burned sugar, and hoppy nose. The color is a fantastic deep red. The flavor is plenty malty, with nice caramel tones, and a nice strong bitterness. Think a Doppelbock DIPA. It's rad! The mouthfeel is a little over carbonated but I won't dock them any points for that. Give it a try!","CCStix","Jul 16, 2013"

Color was a garnet-red with NE-quality clarity. Nose was ticklish with its inherent heat along with a toffee-like sweetness. I felt as though I might sneeze for a moment. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the heat of the alcohol felt as though it were evaporating on my tongue. I may not be worthy of this beer! Getting past that, I began to take in flavors of anise; dried, dark fruit; caramel/toffee and an odd mintiness. Finish was dry, to the point that it was making me sweat and tear up involuntarily. I could only bow in deference to its glorious intensity. Make sure that you know what you are getting into if you open a bottle of Bastard!","woodychandler","Jul 15, 2013"

It has a great malt/hop balance, the color is a nice amber, a good finger to finger and half of nice white/off-white head, and a slightly sweet and bitter smell. It has a great bite on the pallet, but still smooth drinking.","RyV","Jun 18, 2013"

Smell is sweet caramel malt and hops bitterness. Because I wanted to try it so much I just dove right in. Lacing nicely and up front is full on hops. The citrus becomes more evident on the nose and in the finish. Nice long finish, medium carbonation and medium body. You would think to look at this beer that it would be heavy but it’s surprisingly light. It’s fully loaded with hops and strong malt backbone realizing a rich deep flavor that is not complex but rather assertive and in your face arrogant.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

But this particular example - not doing it for me. Malty and boozy, and not in a good way. EDIT: Reading some other reviews, I'm wondering if this was old or just a bad batch. I got almost no hop flavors/bitterness, let alone aroma. Guess I'll really have to try it again and see if it's better the next time around.

Arrogant Bastard has a taste not quite like beers I've had before... there's some bitterness in there, for sure, but it's not as intense as it seems a lot of people like to describe it. The hops in this beer mixed with the malts balance it perfectly. I've had some people try and tell me it tastes/feels "soapy", but I don't get that at ALL ... maybe that's because I had it on-tap. The taste is complex to the point where I can't pinpoint exactly how I remember it being, but it was interesting, and it was super tasty... a seemingly wild blend of hops and malt, and I couldn't get quite enough of my sample.

The aroma emanates grassy American hops, but I also noticed a background caramelized malt, which makes it very pleasing too. The taste, well-carbonated, medium-bodied, brings again the very characteristic American hops, and the slightly sweetish, caramelized malt. It is super refreshing, with the alcohol very fitting to the other features of the beer. In the end, we have a strong presence of hops. Excellent!","HabiMendes","Mar 10, 2013"

4.22,1.4,4.25,3.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Honestly, when I first tried this beer, I thought I wasn't "worthy." It wasn't until the second time I had it I realized how truly amazing this ale actually is. At first I was sort of off put by the sheer bitterness that this beer has, but after overcoming that aspect, I absolutely fell in love. With an IBU that's said to be over 100 (Stone says the real IBU is "classified") it can be quite intimidating, especially after reading the blurb on the back of the bottle. That said, I am just blown away by how good this is. It pours a beautiful darkish red color with a bone white head. The pine and sting of the hops is immediately noticeable as you pour. Even more noticeable as you drink with a hint of sweetness behind it along with malt and a bit of roast as well. The mouth is surprisingly smooth with low carbonation. It almost clings to your taste buds, leaving you with a lingering bitterness. This is quite a special and unique ale. I'm glad to say that I'm from the same city where this beast was conceived. I just bought a four pack of the Oaked ABA and eagerly await to try it. Review will follow.","MisSigsFan","Mar 01, 2013"

Smells flowery and hoppy like an IPA, although with a bit thicker malt backbone. Taste follows nose exactly; sweet thick and malty at first, and bitter and hoppy to finish. Mouthfeel is medium, not too full or fizzy. Delicious.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Feb 16, 2013"

At first the inexperienced drinker may find this beer a bit vulgar, cocky and downright mean...but as the offensive posturing of this beer starts to mellow down and slides smoothly down your throat, you will find yourself begging for yet another fake beating. by the fourth gulp, you will be writing love notes.","fireman10","Jan 21, 2013"

I was taken aback by the beer that poured like a brown or amber ale, smelled like an IPA, and tasted like, well, nothing I've ever really had. It is a true conglomeration of styles.

The color is a gorgeous amber brown. the smell is of nothing but earthy hops and booze. The taste follows the nose...super bitter upon a canvas of earthy notes that are centered in this American Strong ale. It is a decent jump-off point and is always fun to revisit but the Arrogant Bastard is nothing more than a well-labeled, over-marketed beer beast. I guess I'm not worthy","djjacobsen","Jan 17, 2013"

Nose is fresh piny hops, grapefruit, sweet caramel malt, bready, pungent. Tastes are definitely bold with pungent, piny, grapefruity hops, bitter up-front, sweetness comes through as bready malt and heavy caramel, almost burnt. Slight earthiness, but the pine rides out the finish and lingers. Medium body, creamy, nice carbonation.

Those who have “come of age” since the 1980’s cannot fully appreciate the dramatic difference between the readily available beers I naively quaffed in my 20’s and 30’s and what is available today. And breweries like Stone are the leaders in providing such a drastic difference between then and now. They are paving the future of beer by expanding the envelope beyond what we so eagerly enjoy today.","abeerwiseguy","Dec 22, 2012"

The head is slightly off white and really doesnt stick around too long. The nose is mostly pine, herbal and floral hops. The taste of this beer starts out with a high bitterness and an intense hop profile. There is a ton of grassy, herbal, spicy notes and a lot of pine and some lemon zest. The beer has a ton of mouth feel and helps to deliver the beers flavors. The other flavors of the beer are toffee, caramel and bread yeast. This is a classic go to beer, best fresh in my opinion.","TwelveOunces","Oct 07, 2012"

Flavor follows suit, but also has a woody and brash herbal hopping aspect that creeps up on you. It is slightly out of balance in favor of the hops (on purpose) but that's sort of the target they were aiming for. For me, this feels like a nice return to aggressive beers that comforts me whenever I'm in the mood for something 'aggressive yet not completely over the top crazy".","WastingFreetime","Oct 04, 2012"

It's quite a bitch slap on your tongue. Strong Ale is the best way to describe it. It's just so strong on your tongue - bitter and complex. I honestly can't pick apart the pieces that make up this beer. The malt and hops work together seemlessly for a balanced taste. I've never tasted sweetness in this beer, though, which some have noted in their reviews. As it warms it is a little smoother, but sweet is an adjective I reserve for the Double Bastard.","TheRealBigC","Sep 27, 2012"

5,20.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Stone Brewery Arrogant Bastard (2013) - Thick creamy head. Excellent lacing. Brillant black body with red hues under heavy light. No carbonation. The bubbles hang stagnant. It's thick. A full mouthfeel. Malt bread aroma. Chocolate and caramel wafting. Coffee and toffee front taste. Coffee, bread, and caramel. Stout, hops highlight, bitters and sours, spicing... fades to porter coffee and expresso. No alcohol. 7.6% ABV... not noticeable in the mouth. Warming the gut and the head. Crisp aftertaste. Lingering hops, citrus note appears, sour brillance, and then warming continues. In the mouth. In the throat. More hops. More coffee. More chocolate and light lemon. Strong. Powerful. Brillant. A serious beer for a serious beer connoisseur. I will not hesitate to tell you... aside from the special editions of this brew (Oaked, Anniversary, etc...) this is the best beer in the world. Simply more art than science. Simply perfect. 5 out of 5.","digitalflood","Aug 27, 2012"

Rudy reddish brown with a coffee ice cream colored head, light tan I suppose. Plenty of lacing. Large aromas of grapefruit, piney, resinous, and a hint of cacao. Packed with hoppy goodness, but balanced by a big ol' malt bill. Flavor follows nose closely. Grapefruit, sticky tree sap resin, clean yeast flavor, a bit of cacao. The hops are well rounded out by the size of this beer. Not a complex beer. Pretty full bodied and thick beer. An iconic beer.","pmlondrigan","Aug 22, 2012"

Smells of very dark grains, roasted malt and burtn toast. The up front is a large amount of burnt bread along with burnt malt. Another drink adds a whiskey like charcoal hit into the mix, along with a large smoky flavor. The mouthfeel makes this beer seem just like a scotch ale. Keeps all of the mentioned flavors but adds a MASSIVE punch of smokeyness to the finish.

The color was a dark brown almost orangy. The aroma had nice fruity and piney notes, more citrus than anything else. The taste was what really made it unique though, it had the strong hop character similar to the aroma, but was backed up perfecty by strong malts.

Arrogant bastard was definitely one of the first brews that got me into craft brews, and I think it was more striking, more intense the first time I had it a long time ago. It's definitely an interesting beer, and definitely worth a try for anyone who appreciates the aggressive nature of the California strong ale (CAIPAFTW!)","dmatsui","Jul 23, 2012"

4.65,11.8,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bomber, poured in a shaker. Pours a deep, dark amber color with some definite ruby-red shining through. Small bubbles race up to a large, frothy head of about 3cm of beige. The head lingers and leaves thick lacing on the glass; a thin film of head remains throughout and leaves a ring to the bottom of the glass. I love the nose of this beer. The hops are by far the dominant force with bright citrusy smells of grapefruit and maybe a touch of orange along with resiny pine. There right behind it, is a backbone of caramel malt, very sweet and definitely very present. I loved taking deep wafts of this one. The taste was hops forward; more citrus and pine note, like on the nose, and blooming on your palate. As the hops develop, there is a good balance with the sweet malts that keep the hops ever so slightly in check. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but not quite, maybe a touch oily with a long bitter finish. Overall, I have had this beer (along with many others) before I found this site, so I waited till I got it again to give it justice. I think I had it before I had really developed my palate, because I had not remembered this one as good as I found it today. I think it is another example of a beer that makes use of very aggressive hops with good balance with the malt. Very tasty and I will buy it everytime I see it.","estlinska","Jun 25, 2012"

It`s got a clear, rusty red colour that I can`t recall seeing before. The downside is that the head isn`t very creamy and disappears pretty fast. You can really notice the hops in the smell, which I wasn`t expecting. On second smell, you really notice the malt too. Good balance. Which of course transfers very well to the taste. Sweet malty flavour up front that finishes moderately bitter, with some anise and grapefruit. It`s quite dry. Overall, nothing amazing but it is a good beer, no doubt.","Intrinsic","Jun 07, 2012"

On the other hand, while strong in flavor, balanced enough that you can get all the flavors in each sip and deeper drink as well such that you want to come back for more. I've had the oaked version of this beer in bottle, but on tap and unoaked...I think it's an even better beer although the smell wasn't as strong as I though it would be. Still, a great beer I will seek out again.","damndirtyape","May 22, 2012"

4.58,10.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours deep caramel brown with a large soapy light tan head. The head retains well, dissipating slowly to leave some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of big malts and resinous hops. It has an earthy smell. There's a nice big caramel malt backbone in the taste that brings some mild sweetness and breadiness to the table. There are some nice piney malts that balance the malt flavors. It's a well balanced flavor with a hoppy aftertaste. The alcohol is not detectable in the taste. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and the drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and worth all the praise it gets. It is an excellent accompaniment for a meal that also has big flavors or if you're looking for a beer to have with a steak dinner.","acevenom","May 18, 2012"

4.31,3.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Glassware, shaker glass. Pours a clear, deep red color with a thick, two finger off-white head. The head barely recedes at all and the lacing is like a sponge coat of paint. The aroma is of pine, citrus, and earthy notes. The taste is dominated by intense bitterness, both upfront front and the back. This is not a session beer. There is significant malt character, but the hops do not give other flavors a chance. The mouthfeel is rich, the head is creamy, almost like froth on a latte. This is an enjoyable beer, perhaps not to be enjoyed daily. I can understand why the brewer's were so hesitant for people to only correlate this beer with Stone.","omokoro","May 07, 2012"

It arrives menacing and dark in color, strong in flavor, and it's alarmingly easy to drink despite it's massive personality. It won't overpower your food, but if you like strong beers, this one is just amazing. I've enjoyed it out of a bottle and from a tap.

4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 2/28/2012. Pours slightly hazy brick red color with a nice 2 finger dense dark cream colored head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, pine, toasted grain, biscuit, grapefruit, light chocolate, herbal, and a touch of dark fruit. Fantastic aromas here with great balance. Taste of big caramel, biscuit, pine, grapefruit, light chocolate, toasted malt, herbal hops, and some dark fruit. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, pine, chocolate, and citrus on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance with the bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very smooth and easy to drink, but is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden; with hardly any warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a fantastic brew from Stone. I have not had this in a while, but it impressed me much more this time around. Excellent balance; with nice flavor complexity.","superspak","Mar 30, 2012"

The head is pretty thin, of an even consistency and despite being thin, does last and laces well. An aroma of malts and subtle hops comes through. While the Stone IPA and double IPA are huge in the hops department, this brew focuses on the malt, and the hops compliment the malt very well. Expect a flavorful but balanced experience if you try the Arrogant Bastard, with a focus on the malt.","iSip","Mar 21, 2012"

The flavor is somewhat extreme but well balanced. The strong hop bitterness mixes well with a sweet malty caramel that sticks to your mouth. It is finished by a somewhat strong alcoholic kick. It gets better as you let it settle towards cellar temperatures.  This is a great American Strong Ale.","thydarkprevails","Feb 20, 2012"

It’s hoppier than I remembered, and indeed you’d think that this is a particularly bitter IPA from just tasting it. The strange thing is that it looks like a brown ale, and the creamy head would suggest something completely different than what you get: in your face hoppy intensity. Stone Brewing makes a case for this beer being something alternative that not many people will like, but actually I think that this comes quite close to some of the stronger and bolder IPAs or maybe Double Pale Ales that are not uncommon in the US. This makes me surprised about how highly rated the beer is. I think that there are certainly better beers in this category out there.","Arborescence","Feb 15, 2012"

I would recommend this beer to any person who wants to get into craft brew, and I hope they hate it and grin the first time they see the marketing, but they'll come back and realize, especially after trying 90% of the other crap out there, that this is the top, and a major part of the reason the craft industry is so strong.","rodney45","Jan 24, 2012"

Aroma of citrus hops, deep caramel, and some light oak and vanilla. Taste is a rich blend of citrus hops with a strong toffee malt backing, but not too sweet. Nicely carbonated with wonderful dry finish, alcohol is well hidden. This is pretty much a go-to beer for me, the best on-tap selection within 2 miles of the workplace.","coldriver","Jan 10, 2012"

Significant lacing residue left behind. Aromas of pine, roasted malt and a touch of fruitiness greeted me when the head settled down. This is, as we all know, a bitter beer but it does provide a pleasing quantity of malt to the hop dryness. Finish is very dry - just the way i like it. A great beer from a company that caters to my taste profile purchased for a paltry fiver at Mom's Bar happy hour in West LA.","dannydetox","Dec 20, 2011"

If you're a big beer drinker who enjoys lingering hops and all the flavors that big beers should have then step right up.

4.38,5.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured this American Strong Ale into a pint glass. The ale poured a dark reddish brown color, produced a off white medium head. Head retention was excellent. Lacing was amazing- nice rings of lace all over the glass. The aroma of the American Strong Ale is full of roasted malt grain and prunes. This is a medium body beer, very drinkable for a Stong Ale. Awesome session beer. Craft Brewing at its best. The taste is malty sweet, almost sticky- Deep roasted taste, full of caramel, dark chocolate and coffee. Finish's sweet. This beer has BALLS- Best example of an American Strong Ale I have had to date.","GossageBrewery","Oct 24, 2011"
3.31,-20.4,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This style is such a broad swath catchall that it's tough to rate Arrogant Bastard within its confines. Like a lot of offerings from Stone, I'm not terribly crazy about this beer and find it a little one-dimensional. However, the over-the-top hop bitterness is an intended effect, and for that I can say that this beer is a success.","amphion1065","Oct 23, 2011"
3.71,-10.8,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Overall I would say this is a very nice beer. But if hoppy as hell bitter beers are not your thing, I wouldn't waste your time. But if you like IPA beers I would grab one of these 22's the next time you get a chance. They are kind of expensive usually around 6 bucks for one of these, and some of their others are even more expensive but its well worth it.","CyclingLush666","Oct 22, 2011"

This is a consistent staple at my family gatherings since we are “worthy”, and while other Stone beers might actually taste better, to me this is still always tasty and I feel loyal to this flagship Stone product which has brought a lot of enjoyment over the years. I am a huge fan of this and could drink this beer all year round and suggest that everyone try it.","CHickman","Oct 20, 2011"

The head cream color and amber beer color are immaculate. The 7.2% alcohol will leave you slow drinking this arrogant bastard.","eonbluekarma","Oct 13, 2011"

It is even better than I remembered, and is truly a fantastic, flavorful and powerful ale. I will be picking this one up far more often. It is imperative that you see "if you are worthy", definitely give this one a try, two thumbs way up for me. Don't try other styles after this in the same evening though - the hops are powerful and will linger on the palate long after the session ;)","blackcompg","Oct 05, 2011"
4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Big flavor, lots of balance and a heavy hit of alcohol. This beer is definitely a classic for a reason. I wouldn't try to drink anything afterwards because it leaves your mouth feeling totally ravished, but it's worth it.","DaveBlack","Oct 03, 2011"
4.3,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Don't want an over the top IPA? Don't want a malt heavy beer? How about a perfect combination of both? From the color to the smell to the taste this is an awesome beer.

4.05,-2.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This pours a dark, hazy brown and has a good amount of off-white head and sticky lacing. The smell is dark fruit and a little spice. The flavor is heavy bitterness and dark-fruits…I guess. I feel like the flavor should be sweeter or something, I just taste a lot of extreme bitterness...black walnut comes to mind. I’m not complaining, however, I don’t even love highly sweet beers. This beer is definitely tasty, but I would like to revisit it in a food pairing situation. Additionally, I think this beer would be best served in the fall or winter. At a $3.59 price point, I see myself coming back to this in those situations when you want something a little meatier than an IPA.","beerdown77","Sep 26, 2011"

The nose is comprised of citrus, pine and oak with a floral hops, it is a little boozey but it adds to the character. The flavor is hops, and malt with a toffee sweetness, bitter bite at the finish.

4.45,7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Arrogant Bastard Ale is marketed correctly, I'd say. It's a wild brew with some serious flavor and a lot of complexity, which is miraculously well organized--it doesn't taste like everything at once. It also does a good job of keeping a first timer on their toes looking like a dark brew, smelling like an IPA and tasting like a well balanced red ale (with some uncharacteristic qualities!).

4.28,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"O: A solid strong ale that is, as it states, not for everyone. It has wonderful bitter flavor, but also has some sweet sugar notes that balance the beer.

When I was first getting into craft beer, I purchased this beer for name alone, not really knowing what I was getting into. I honestly drain poured my first bomber not because I didn't like it, but because it was too much for me. Since, I have had many run-ins with this beer, including trying it on tap, and I have quickly come to realize that I prefer this beer with a few months on it. Fresh is a little too hoppy in my opinion and I prefer to allow the hops to mellow slightly, allowing the malt to come through more. Personally, I prefer this beer right around its "Best By" date.","output01x","Aug 01, 2011"

The smell is loads of malts caramel and toffee, with a slight pine hoppy presence. Feel is medium with a bitter hoppy coating. The taste is pretty good, you get a nice bready toffee malt taste (not as much caramel as I expected), followed by a complete mouth coating pine hop bitterness. Overall as allways a great product by stone, I usually buy the IPA because I like the citrus/grapefruit taste it has or the Oaked AB because I liked the added oak/vanilla flavor, but this one is an excellent beer and if stone didn't have so many other great beers, I'd get this much more. I think Stone might be my favorite brewery.","DavidST","Jul 31, 2011"

The smell is slightly sweet - with tones of caramel malts and a slight pop of citrus hops underneath. The beer's taste is powerful and strong, but surprisingly well balanced and sneaky with regards to hiding it's ABV. At first taste the beer smacks you upfront with a strong citrus hop bite. Then you get pleasant sweet caramel and roasty - almost nutty - tones throughout the drink with a clean-dry finish on the swallow. There's a notable amount of hop oil which lingers on the tongue after the swallow, but it's not overpowering and balances the malt tones gracefully.

This beer was just a really good starting point for me when venturing out into the beer world. Had my first bottle on 4-17-2008. The beer poured out as a deep amber color. The head is pretty thick looking and white. head that laces the glass really well. The smell was stronger than what I was used to at the time, It was big and hoppy, a subtle sweetness on the nose as well. The taste has a strong pine flavor to it. The hop character of this beer is very good. The other tastes were of some caramel malts that gave is a slight sweetness and a light wooden flavor too. The mouthfeel is medium and had a good drinkablity to it. Overall, I think this beer is a classic in it's own way.

Bitterness on the finish sticks around a bit too long for my taste and is the one and ONLY drawback, but overall, an almost perfect drinking experience.","jgurley","Jun 06, 2011"

This beer had a balance of the hop character of a highly-hopped single I.P.A., and a fruit after-taste of a double I.P.A. It is one of the most complex brews I have tried recently.

The faint taste of diacetyl, but I'm hypersensitive to it. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation.

Nose is hopped to high heaven, lots of tropical notes with a sturdy malt base to support it. Taste kicks off with a blast of hops and massive malt backbone. Citrus and tropical notes contend with and intense bitterness imparted by the alpha acids. Huge caramel toffee base giving this loads of body. An interesting cinnamon spiciness comes out here as it warms, along with some dark tea flavours. Great bitterness here and a full, hefty feel. A suggestion of the alcohol is made, but that only adds to how good this was. An off center imperial red, methinks...","liamt07","Apr 26, 2011"
3.71,-10.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Picked up at my local up the street. They even opened up a slot in the cooler to stash it. Glad they are sticking to the Stone guidelines. Poured a 22oz double deuce into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep amber with a great 3 inch head that leaves seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is hoppy up front. Nice notes of citrus and pine mixed with toffee and caramel with just a bit of biscuit and toast. As it warms the pine really starts drowning out everything else. Almost like blowing your nose with a pine branch. The flavor actually has a lot more malt then the nose would have led you to believe. Nice caramel and toffee notes with just a bit of burnt toast. Piny hopes help balance out the malt. Just a bit of booze and a hint of a medicinal hop bitterness at the tail of the flavor profile.

4.06,-2.4,5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hefty two finger head, the head is very close to white, but not quite. The head is retaining itself very well, not going anywhere so far. It looks very frothy too, lots of small bubbles, a few big ones. The body has a deep red color, with hints of brown, it's barely see through, for the most part it's cloudy and you cannot see through it at all, but at some points you can. This beer looks very good, the head is still there!!! Wow. On one hand this beer smells very standard, just a hoppy ale, with some malt and not much else. However, there is a very lively feeling to it, I don't necessarily pick up fruit on the nose, but I just feel like it's going to be there. It's a weird feeling, because it's a unique smell, but I can't quite distinguish what's so unique about it. One thing is for sure, it smells hoppy and intriguing. Interesting taste, not as hoppy as I thought it would be on the smell. The malts are also a lot more noticeable. There may be some hints of fruit in here, but they are very very small. It tastes very standard, but at the same time it's a very unique standard, it's hard to explain, but for sure a unique taste, even if it is very subtle. The mouthfeel is pretty damn good, it's not huge, but it's pretty substantial for what a strong ale should be, and on some sips you get some creaminess from the head (which is still there btw) which is very nice. Drinkability isn't too bad either, like I said the hops aren't as present as I thought they would be, which is a little disappointing, but it makes for a smoother, more balance drinking. Overall, this is a very solid beer. I would call it a unique beer, but in very subtle ways, it's not the craziest beer out there, but it has a nice personality too it, and it is of course well crafted, I say of course because Stone makes good beer.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 14, 2011"

5,20.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Stone always knows how to properly hop their beers in the manner they describe it... I'm never disappointed, when they say its going to be bitter or very hoppy it always is. As soon as you smell it you get that trademark Stone brewery pine smell with citrus and the sweet malt in the background. I love how Stone is one of the only breweries that gets that pine hop resin taste and mixes it real well with citrus hops. The malt really comes into play in this beer and almost reminds me of what some breweries would call a black ipa. It kind of reminds me of a hoppier Victory Yakima Glory but better. The roasted malt blends in so nicely with the resinous hop bite it gives. That's the word that sets Stone IPA or highly hopped beers aside from other breweries highly hopped IPA's...resinous. Nobody can ever complain they don't get an amazing hop flavor and bite unless its past due its expiration date. This might be even hoppier than their regular IPA they brew mostly because of the different hops they use and the roasted malt coming together for a more bitter bite. Amazing beer that regular beer drinkers might have a hard time drinking because of the intense amount of flavor this has. Beer never tasted so rich, potent and good. I don't think this brewery can make a bad beer. My favorite California brewery.","thebrood1987","Jan 15, 2011"

Syrupy sweet roasted malt with a bit of bite from the hops. Full bodied with low carbonation. Drinks like a breast. Not too rich or syrupy in texture though. Nice, resiny hops cut the malty sweetness to make it more drinkable. Nice roasted, almost nutty flavors play on the palate before a wave of hop bitterness cuts through all that to the point that you think your palate might be ruined for the next sip. Bright, bitter hops linger on the finish. Every time I have this I am reminded how good it is. This is the definition of a classic microbrew.","hoppyhampy","Jan 14, 2011"
4.2,1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer that popped my "Stone Brewing cherry" years ago. Usually poured from a 22 oz. bomber into pint glass. Dark amber brownish body with light brown / off white frothy head with excellent lacing. Interesting aroma - Citrus, earthy, caramel, toast....overall gentle on the nose...but what a surprise thereafter! Taste is predominant bitter and woody, some spice. Bitter is not in a pale ale or IPA sort of way, and much more aggressive than smooth. Palate is moderatley thick and syrupy residue that lingers a good while. Depth and complexity that leaves you guessing and wanting more. A nice beer!","CuriousMonk","Jan 14, 2011"

It has a very distinct syrupy feel at first, rather malty and driven to the total, extreme opposite of what overtakes it within seconds- an extremely robust bitterness that almost numbs the palate instantly. While it may hold for a solid pint, the IBUs certainly hit me super-hard and it would be tough to sip and session this one. It also lacks the distinct woody musky feel the OAB has, which certainly makes it a better beer in my opinion.

Taste is very sweet and oily, hop bitterness coming through in the end and staying through the aftertaste, the toasted grain really comes out in the taste. Mouthfeel is very sticky, medium bodied. Drinkability is average, this is a good beer but not one I'd want to have more than one or two of in a night as a result of a moderately high ABV and the sweetness","ramseye4","Dec 02, 2010"

Not much of a head on its crystal clear reddish brown body, but a thick lace will follow it right down to the bottom of your glass.

It's thick as to be expected, and its very drinkable for a strong ale. Stone thought it would be a good idea to add double of EVERYTHING and it works amazingly well.

There is a bitterness about this beer that I like a lot. I also think the sweetness of the malt cuts it nicely. I also taste some fruity notes in there and some citrus hops. The mouthfeel is also very nice on this. It coats the mouth well so you can really taste it. It has a nice medium body that is leaning a little more towards the heavy end of the spectrum. nice carbonation as well. I find this beer to be very drinkable. This is one of my 'go to' beers, and I could drink these night after night without getting bored. I think stone did a great job on this beer.

First sip, a full on assault on your mouth, very hoppy at first, but after a few sips it becomes more complex, once you get past the initial hop attack. Unlike some other beers that are very hoppy, there is a nice sweetness of malt comes through about half way though the glass. Really good with extra sharp Cheddar and whole grain crackers.

The hops, with citrus and apricot are very well balanced. The bitter hops seem to linger in the aftertaste for awhile. The malt presence is more at the beginning of the sip, and diminishes with each passing second. Alcohol very well hidden. Loving the way this one is tasting right now.

The smell lets out some nice citrus and dark fruit, and some bread scents. The taste is great - hops are assaulting at first but seem to hold back after the first few sips and let the flavors shine. Pine, caramel sweetness, candied bread, grapefruit and plum are tastes I pick up. There is some alcohol bite that shows up now and then. The mouthfeel is good, but feels a little watery and unbalanced after having Double Bastard not too long ago. Still there is a nice creaminess. A bomber is plenty for this beer, lots of palate assaulting going on. I love this beer, I will continue to get every once in a while.","Chico1985","May 07, 2010"

Grapefruit and hops are the most powerful. At first the taste is smooth and once finished a bitter taste lingeres in the back of your mouth. From the outside Arrogant Bastards looks and smells amazing. Dark orange/brown color and I found it to smell very sweet with some hoppy overtones. What set me back was the drinkabilty toward the end of the 22oz bottle. It started to taste like dandilion flowers and had warmed up a bit much.

I searved it at room temp. and that may be why I get mostly alchool, but that is not bad. This is a strong ale. Even if I cannot taste the hops or grain, they are there working together to balance the beer as a 12 year casking would for wiskey; I suppose that is why the barrel aged version is acclaimed strongly.

There are tiny bubbles rising within the glass. As I drink, it leaves behind some great lacing. The aroma is equally impressive. There are a lot of musty, grain-like fresh hops. Yum. The AB has an intense hop flavor on top of a good, slightly sweet malt base. It's an all-around excellent flavor. It has a medium body and an excellent level of carbonation. The chill of the serving temperature and the carbonation bubbles are very playful; almost too much so, but not quite. Generally, I like the AB just a bit warmer, but this still feels great.

In fact, as you continue the bitterness continues on for 3 or 4 swallows after you stop. Surprisingly, as you become accustomed to it you can begin to appreciate the roasted malts and even a little sweetness from the alcohol as it warms.

Looking back online, I know I've had this beer before, but I am now surprised that I have never reviewed it. Anyway, it was served in a pint glass. Very dark red color. Rich and creamy looking head. Not much smell was noticed. Taste is what you expect from a Stone beer: quality through and through. Nice mix of hops and malt, with a hint of sugar to brighten things up. The only thing that caught me off guard was the mouthfeel. While I liked it, it was much more creamier than I remembered. My wife also had a pint, and she swore it drank like a Guinness. Do they do ABA on nitro tap? Because that is what it tasted like. Didn't expect that, from Stone or this restaurant. Problem with the tap line perhaps? I don't know, but I need to try this again somewhere else to see if I am going crazy or maybe I just haven't had this beer in a while. I liked this beer, but it left me puzzled.","morebeergood","Feb 01, 2010"

The combination of big citric hops and sweet caramel malt makes a mockery of style guidelines while still feeling utterly natural and refined. The flavor is balanced - big hops, big malt, big flavor. Arrogant Bastard has become a defining beer of the American craft movement and sits as the flagship of one of the best known and most loved craft breweries.

Floral hops and freshly cut grass aromas wafted from the glass. Massive hops dominated the flavor, with floral and grassy notes. The finish was bitter and lip-puckering dry. The hop aftertaste lingered. No balancing act here, this beer is all about the hops. I liked it though. I felt it offered something outside the norm.","Jethro6191","Jan 31, 2010"

4.1,-1.4,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a deep mahogany, rust color with an off white to khaki frothy head that recedes after a few moments of grandeur and leaves a chunky ring of lace as it settles. Smells of caramel malt hit first and hen give way to pine and mostly grapefruit hop aromas. Nice fruitiness from the yeast, some grain and alcohol heat. Later as it warms some nutty smells and phenols are present. From the start it has a very complex taste. At first the boldness tease then beats the hell out of the palate until you submit. Sweet malt flickers upfront but then backs off to the powerful hops (which are part of the classified recipe). The hop flavors start as pine, and then grapefruit follows it up and kowtows to the massive bitter finish. It has a medium to full body, with good carbonation and it is actually quite pleasant once you get a hold of this beast. Definitely a bold beer to drink all night or to pair with mild cuisine, but it might be paired well with spicy barbeque, other seasoned or smoked meats, strong cheese, or something that can fight back in the battle of your tongue.","Lldeegan","Jan 18, 2010"

Definitely not as hoppy as a Stone should be. Hops are right up in front on the palate but fade quickly to a nice thick malty backbone. Should have reviewed a fresher one I suppose, but the taste is not lacking whatsoever. For being almost a year old, the hops are still kicking but have lost their fruity and bitter punch.

It tastes remarkably balanced. It starts hoppy and then the malt comes through in the end. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is extremely drinkable due to its balance. I drank the oaked version a while back and wasn't impressed, I think because its marketed as an extreme beer.

A strong, floral hop structure in the smell with some roasted caramel malts and an oak-laden sweetness. A bit of alcohol in the nose, which rolls into the taste. Most of the alcohol and hops are present up front, which turns a bit sour on the back end, almost like a rhubarb bitterness that hide the sugars in the beer. Smooth, long draw in the mouth that is surprisingly well-balanced.

Nice contrasts of flavors in each stage of the flavor profile, making a complex, drinkable brew.

Smells is surprisingly not as strong as I expected. Smells of malts, dark fruits, hops and a tiny bite of alcohol, would like more strength out of this. Tastes of malts, dark fruits (raisins, plums, some citrus), alcohol bite comes into play but is good for most of the beer (starts to take over after most of the glass is gone). Huge hops up front before any of the mentioned tastes, the typical stone hop taste. The balance is nice before the alcohol takes over at the end, some chocolate even comes into play near the end of my glass. Medium body with decent creamyness and a good balance of body and alcohol warming. This is probably my favorite aspect of the beer. Carbonation is medium and suits the beer nicely, a coat of dark fruits is left on the tongue. Drinkability is good. Good taste, the price was not too bad for the quality. Alcohol will certainly kill this one after a while. Probably get it again for $6 a bomber, nice on tap also.","cbutova","Oct 18, 2009"

The flavor then follows to the sweet and sour citrus of the grapefruit and short astringency of the hop bitterness that lingers for a couple of seconds in the aftertaste before dissipating. And finally it all ends to the gentle warmth of the alcohol left in the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is just right, with a medium body and enough carbonation to the brew. The bitterness isn't as discouraging as I had originally thought when I first tried it, so I say that the drinkability is excellent. And it's definitely more of a drinker than a sipper.

It has a campfire quality in the taste that I found very appealing and definitely something that lends this beer to a more dynamic range of food pairings than perhaps a straight American IPA. A nice display of flavors overall and a good, dry finish on the end. I think this was Stone's original flagship beer before the IPA caught on and it's easy to see why.

I know I'm probably taking the damn label WAAAAY too seriously, but in my eyes if you put statements like that on your bottle, your beer sure as hell better deliver. And Arrogant Bastard simply did not deliver. It reminded me of the compressed pellet of hops I tasted when I toured the Anheiser-Busch brewery in St. Louis.

The tap version is sweeter than the bottle. The aroma is the same, but not quite as strong on tap, most likely due to the cold serving temp.

Caramel and molasses-like characters from the malt are just behind the hop to give a warming, full flavor. Mouth is very nice, full but not chewy. Its got a light feel for the robust flavor and full body. Perhaps not one of the best, but very, very good.

Truly, a "well-hopped premium bitter" like this (this is how I appreciate this ale, regardless of any self-acclaimed beer style imposed here or by Stone, which it hasn't) shouldn't be an "Arrogant Bastard" in any sense. Frankly, I've never been able to grasp the humour (or pretentiousness) of Stone's beer-naming "strategy" (on top of lines and lines of unnecessary/redundant/quite uninformative explanation on the back label for many ales they bottle), which is quite a failure; but, I loyally love their beers.

I can smell the hops from a distance kind of fruity, and there are even some sweet bready, caramelly malts in there. Overall, a very nice mix of smells - almost straightforward, and sort of wavers between bold and subdued. I like it. The flavor comes up kind of like the smell. Not a harsh bitterness, but there's a good kick. Also, not a huge amount of hop flavor - I get some spiciness though, like mint almost in the finish, though I know clearly that quite a bit of hops were used in here. The maltiness shines through pleasantly, biscuity, kind of sweet. Overall, the taste is very nice. The mouthfeel is a little bit disappointing when compared to the rest of this beer. Mine seems a little watery, kind of clingy, and there's an odd burn (I don't think it's alcohol related) as it goes down. This one drinks pretty well. I mean, it's a well-executed beer.

The third bottle was... let's say not so good. Okay, actually the third bottle was really pretty bad. I'm going to assume that I just had a bad bottle though, and rate it from the first couple bottles. It pours fairly dark with a nice piney scent, with a hint of citrus. The taste is just about what you expect from the scent. Hoppy... very hoppy... with a nice caramel flavor. The feel is good, and the drinkability pretty good. One bottle was enough for me. I'll eventually get some more of it, if I can get past the worry that I'll get another bad bottle. The bad one was really nasty... but when it's what it should be, it's a really great beer.","showell","May 10, 2009"

There is some type of too-sweet ingredient that I find out of place in this beer. Other reviewers have stated that they detect citrus flavors. Well, I cannot taste them.

Bitter is not in a pale ale or IPA sort of way, and much more aggressive than smooth. Palate is moderatley thick and syrupy residue that lingers a good while.

Next is the sweet fruit that gives way to a bitter kick that appears and mellows after each swallow. I'm not a big bitters fan but I find this one tolerable and I know it's by design.

Perhaps, the bottle is a bit on the older side. Hops come forward first, with a piney taste. A malty sweetness persists in the middle that gives way to a strong bitterness. Not quite astringent, but the alcohol is definitely there. Mouthfeel is just about perfect for this beer. Well carbonated to carry the hops and booze off the tongue.

Lots of roasted malts, caramel and wheat toast notes are up front supported by a background of citrus-pine needle hop aromas. Mouthfeel is just perfect; smooth, chewy and round. Flavors in turn are definitely all about the hops here, but the sweetness of the malts balance things out very nicely. Starts out with somewhat semi-sweet dark wheat bread, smokey, fig flavor, but quickly transcends into a big, crisp and bitter hoppy long finish.

I'm always searching for something I haven't tried yet that will leave my mouth tingling from bitterness. Once I saw this brew said "You're not worthy" I knew I had to try. It poured almost a brown which was cloudy with bubbles rising from the depths instantly. I chilled it to a near freezing temperature because I love cold brew, this might have made it more stronger tasting but I loved it. I can barely describe the taste because it changes so much so fast. After a swallow an immediate hoppy bitterness congregated on my palate. A fantastic beer! And still as my pilsner glass sits it is covered from top to bottom in the thickest lacing I've ever seen. A must do for any beer connoisseur!","DunDun","Dec 20, 2008"

The hops are very aggressive and while the malt does its best to keep up with them, they dominate the flavor profile. Personally, I would prefer less emphasis on bitterness and more complex and subtle hop flavor, but that might also require less dark malt to let the hops shine through.

Hoppier than I expected (a blend of floral, citrus, and piney hops), but blended really well with the malt base. The first time I had this was early in my beer palate development, so it wasn't anything special to me (especially since I didn't appreciate hops at that point). Having it a second time (now a time when IPAs and ASAs are becoming my new fave styles), I was quite pleasantly surprised and blown away by this beer!

The beer is incredibly balance with a huge bitterness coming through at the end, but a sweetness lingers through the whole tasting. There is a great complexity of hops and maltiness that I can't quite put my tongue on. It's like the hops and malts are fighting for the forefront of the flavour but end up having a great compromise! I think I might have to check into chinook hops! This remeinds me of a beefed up Red Ale. The mouthfeel is nice any creamy! Exactly what I'd expect! The ale is pretty god damn drinkable as well!

The taste is huge from start to finish: starts off with sweet malts, moves through to diacetyls and faint caramel, then hits you hard with a hop finish that goes on and on -- big hits of grapefruit or tangelo, maybe even lemon rind. The hop finish also makes for a rather pleasantly dry mouthfeel in the end, though before that what strikes me is the smoothness of it: perfectly carbonated, just enough to fill your mouth with all this goodness.

Near the end of the bottle, I guess I have acclimated a bit to the bitterness presence of hops, giving leaving me with a non-sweet citrus only taste. Kind of reminds me of grapefruit.

Mild carbonation that makes this easy to drink for a heavier than average beer. Taste is malty. Tastes a tad smokey to me, but I like it (maybe I'm drinking it wrong?).

On the lighter side of moderate carbonation with a body bordering on viscous, slick. A plethora of pleasant tastes all balanced perfectly. Rich slick mouthfeel.

Sour and woody, befitting of its name this one with a long, though not terribly complex finish. On the light side of medium in body.

It has a very elusive aroma profile. Not too malty, yeasty or hoppy. They all meld very well. Flavour is way hoppier than the aroma would lead you to think. Again kind of elusive. Bitter hops, some plum and then an almost chocolate like malt presence. Dry and bitter and slightly roasty on the finish. Mouthfeel is full but not heavy or oily. Carbonation is medium.

It has a subtle but full carbonation and it is very easy to guzzle this stuff. The hops sneak up on you after a while with more bite, ending up all over your tongue.

Pours a dark, burnt copper color with a very large tan head and sticky lacing. A very aromatic hop scent is emitted into the air. Bitter citrus with caramel and sweet breads. I can't believe how well the aroma permeates the air surrounding the top of the glass. Creamy on the palate with a nice bite and puckering finish. Medium bodied and filling. Grand flavor of resinous hops and roasted, sweet malts. A touch nutty, grapefruit and spruce. The flavor sticks to your ribs and assaults the senses.

Taste is heavy on the citrus hops, backed up by a sweet roasty malt character that gives this brew an interesting complexity. Like nothing I've had before. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and well carbonated, but goes down fairly easy. We'll put this one in the medium-bodied category. The bomber is going down fast, mostly because the flavor is so big and so delicious.

It smells of smoky dark fruits (black cherry and raisin is what I'm thinking), caramel and roasty malt but for the high hop profile it has not much of 'em really show up in the aroma. The flavor is quite complex and much different from what one would think strictly based off the scent. A spicy tart hop kiss touches the taste buds first but a warming molasses & malt thing surrounds it calming down. Somewhere in the middle there's a touch of black tea too. The hops and tea thing do tend to somewhat stick to the roof of the mouth but the finish, especially in the throat, is crisp and clean with a just a slight hop burn coming up as it's down the hatch.","Dalem","Jul 09, 2008"

It looked rather normal, similar to other beers. The aroma is through the roof hoppy and a little like honey from the malts. the taste is very strong bitter on the front end, but leaves smoothly. There is a full bodied mouth feel to this beer, where you will almost gag on it if you have had too much to drink.

Good retention that eventually coalesced into a dollop of white in the center. Head was reconstituted with a light swirl and completely refreshed with each pour. Scent of hops, hops and more hops, as well as a hint of pine and citrus that lent a medicinal quality to the nose. Also thought I detected some dark-skinned fruit in there. Taste was consistent with nose and flavors seemed a bit muddled. Lingering bitterness between quaffs left a bad taste in my mouth.

The smell was a mellow maple malt. It had a maple fruity taste with a bittersweet aftertaste, almost like coffee but not so strong. Was heavy bodied for an ale, but in a good way. A well balanced tasty treat, delicious to the last drop. Need to keep in mind the 7.2 APV because I don't get a stong alcohol flavor and I could definately have a few of these.

It has a slightly heavy body, but is definitely drinkable. With your first taste you get the wonderful citrus piney hop flavor on your palate and then it mellows out and the bitterness flows through leaving a nice crisp finish.

A wonderful taste as well, an excellent balance of malts and hops, leaning towards the former, with a nice, but not overpowering, hoppy aftertaste.

Well lets just say you should try some yourself its worth your time. If you can't wait and need a spoiler then here it is. First taste is slightly sweet and malty, not fruity but a good ale flavor. This is what beer should taste like. From there the hops creep up your tongue and do a little dance on your taste buds. After you swallow the bitterness of the hops stays with you for a few moments. It doesn't leave a bad bitter taste in your mouth but it does whet your appitite for more. This beer doesn't suck.","jbphoto88","Nov 02, 2007"

I couldn't really pick up on a distinct smell, It just smelled to me like an english dark ale.

This is a good looking beer that borders between a n Amber and a Brown ale in color. The smell is hoppy and malty at the same time. The taste is like a battle between citrus hops and caramel tasting malt flavors. This is very good stuff fresh but if you get a bottle out of date you will not get the full experience on this one; the hops really fade.

The sour soon turns to the hops with a burnt and bitter taste. I found nothing unappealing with this variation of tastes. You mouth feels slightly bitter and dry when all said and done.

Aroma is bursting with pineapple along with candy sugar, alcohol, and rum. A half ton of citrus hop flavor rides a firm base of malty goodness. Finishes fairly bitter, but with lots of flavor to balance it out. The bitterness doesn't seem to disappear completely, and builds up over time. Innnnteresting.

Can taste the beginnings of some flavor components that really come out in the oaked version. Very nice velvety feel with medium-heavy body.

Despite it being passed its prime (date), I imaginged a high alcohol would have preserved its flavor better (maybe the store's storage was poor). There is an okay hop bitter finish, but nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel couldn't make up for its flavor being syrupy ; it had a "big" body but it also finished thin and watery.

I thought this was a strong, chewy Brown Ale at first. Good balance with some mild hops. A bit of warming alcohol. Excellent mouthfeel for the decently thick flavors - I think this was spot-on; I've had far too many watered-down "Strong" Ales. Overall, an exceptional beer.

As expected, huge hops aroma with just a touch of malt foundation. The hops are heavy on the metals, relatively light on the citrus, but American all the way. On the palate, smooth pale malts hit the tongue first off, but the flavors move toward the back of the tongue very quickly, displaying lots of hop oils and citrus notes. Metals are toned down from the aroma. Very strong, oily bitterness is the key theme here -- from the mid-palate through the finish, my mouth is coated with hop oils. It's rough, tough, and definitely not subtle. Overall, this is the quintessential American strong ale -- big alcohol, very hoppy, not too balanced with malts. Not really my style, but good for what it is.","geexploitation","Apr 14, 2007"

Would like to see more carbonation in the mouthfeel. It is finished being somewhat flat. Alcohol is hidden making it go down smoother than it should being such a full-bodied ale. Strong phenolic notes noted on the finish. Long lingering bitterness on the aftertaste. It is not really balanced in the taste and mouthfeel areas. Overall a great brew and worth a repeated buy.

The beer pours a cloudy brownish-red color with a yellow colored, creamy head. The smell is of piney-citrus hops, very present. There is an initial sweetness, followed by a hop-bomb similar to the nose that lingers on the palate for hours after the beer is finished.

Taste is incredible. Amazing balance of hoppy bitterness and complex malt flavors, caramel and raisins, and about a thousand other things. Really an amazing taste. Feel is fairly heavy (I needed something lighter after to ease up on the pallet a little) and full-bodied. Good carbonation. Overall, a really delicious beer. The first time I had this one it was too much for me, I couldn't handle it (just like the bottle says). But after having a couple more this one really comes through as original and quite delicious.

This head is going nowhere! Taste is very good....bitter hops up front give way to some glorious malts with a nice roastedness and a re-appearance from the banana. Mouthfeel is excellent and the finish is earthy and it makes my mouth water like quench chewing gum. The alcohol is pleasantly subdued for the abv%. This is seriously growing on me...even though the alcohol isn't overpowering it still gives you a little chest warmth. The aftertaste is caramel-like with a load of grassy bitter hops. Ok the head is still 70%after five minutes...impressive...I appreciate their arrogance....this is first rate....would like to try the 'oaked' version.","witster18","Feb 16, 2007"

I think they are amarillos, but not sure. Taste is wonderful, a close perfect balance between malt and hops...one doesn't over power the other. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very high.

Smell is somewhat dull, definite scent of hops, a hint of spiciness. Taste is a shockingly strong orange at first, with aspects of pear and pomegranate, giving way to a spicy hop taste and mellowing out to almost a smooth creaminess. Not a real cream taste, more like a cream soda. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, very heavy. Drinkability is ok, the only real problem is the oily mouthfeel, though I could see this being a positive to some people.

Nice nose with a very pleasant and distinct aroma. The taste was of a nice well rounded malt flavor up front. Roasted nutty malt flavors followed by a light sweetness on the tongue. Mild hop bitterness rounds out the well balanced flavor in the back of the mouth. This is a great full bodied brew. Great rolling flavor from start to finish. Very smooth and drinkable.

Taste is a very balanced to me- the malts and hops are in synchronicity. I was expecting more of a hop blast- it may be that I have held on to this bottle too long and the hops has subsidided. No matter- still a classic west coast beverage. Or it the lack of hops could be due to my mouth being hammered into a submission by a Surly Furious a couple of hours earlier. Mouthfeel is rich with a medium to low carbonation. The head dissapated quite quickly in my pint glass.

The taste is a caramel maltiness up front with a long lasting intense bitterness at the end. Fresh wet hops are present throughout. As it warms, caramel is much more apparent in the aroma, and the lingering bitterness is much less than I remember the very first time I had it.

It says it's a strong ale, but could almost be passed off as a double IPA. I kinda like the fruity taste, but seems pretty bitter for a strong ale.

If this thing were about 14% abv, I think I would be more appreciative of it because I could forgive some of the harsh abrasiveness. As it stands it tastes like a monster only it is not really that strong considering. This beer has a great name. I wish it deserved to be so arrogant though. I think some people have been punked out by the smack talk on the bottle. Nice Jedi mind tricks. Stone's other products are much more deserving of the praise. They make some truly stellar beers.

Aggressively poured a three inch frothy light brown head w/ a cloudy dark amber/ caramel hue. The head last throughout the drink and left good amount of lacing. The aroma was outstanding. Heavy malt/ caramel and a moderate piney or perfume hop. Although this brew is an American Strong Ale, the amount of hops would make you think its a IPA. (YUM). Finally, when I taste. It began w/ a moderate sweet caramel and had a long lasting heavy citrus hop ending. The bastard has a nice medium body, watery and lively feel to it.

Thier beers are not for the timid, the gargoyle has just punched me in the nuts a few times but of course he helps you up and burshes you off. In general all of the stone beers are pretty strong and this one started the tradition I think. Well anyway on to the arrogant bastard! Pours a dark cherry with a very light tan head that stays and laces very well. The smell is hops, alcohol and citrus fruits. A complex tate the hops jump out but I also pick out peach, dark fruits, fresh bread, and the alcohol sting just in the background. The mouthfeel is pretty thick but enjoyable. Not a chore to drink at all! At least for me. I could drink this stuff all night but after more then 2 bombers I would need to take a cab. As I said before stone is truly one of my favorite beer companies and I always love trying thier special releases. And they never let me down! Thier beer is always good and strong!

A good malty, piney, begining then with a sweet, grapefruit again middle. The hops are present the whole way through but especially after. A very thick coating ale by all means.

Better than I remember. Mouthfeel is perfectly suited to the taste medium body with no more and no less than it needs.

4.61,10.8,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Simply put one of the best, most complex beers I have ever tasted. The appearance is amazing. Dark, ruby red/brown tint with a caramel colored head that leaves uber Belgian-like amounts of lacing and never dissipates throughout being drunk. Probably has the best head retention I've ever seen out of a pint glass. The smell is actually pretty sweet, not bitter like the bottle and company suggests. Very cocoa and caramel like. The taste is the amazing part. The 7.2% is very well hidden leaving you to actually be able to scarf some arrogance down fairly fast, but why would you do that anyways?...Many, many different flavors bombarding your mouth at once. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy, but not sticky, which is perfect for me. Creamy once you get to the head. In fact, about the last 1% of the pour is pure cream. Awesome.

With your first taste you get the wonderful citrus piney hop flavor on your palate and then it mellows out and the bitterness flows through leaving a nice crisp finish.

It has a bitter aftertaste that lingers from the hoppy presence. The mouthfeel is ok, lots of carbonation, decent balance. This beer is strong and if you are afraid of hops then stay away. It does represent a potent beer, but the label got me amped up for something much more. A good stone offering and worth checking out.

Nice hoppy/piney nose, with a bit of maltiness and slight alcohol as well. Just like the smell, the first sip shouts "HOPS". Very hoppy up front, but mellows nicely. Let it warm, it gets even smoother. The roasted maltiness and carmel also nicely round out the profile. Even thought this is a smooth beer, as big beers like this go, you can definitely taste the alchohol, which is a good thing.

Flavor was a lightly roasted malt, well balanced by the hops, again with a grapefruit type flavor. Some alcohol was present, but not excessive. Light to medium in body, with fairly high carbonation. The alcohol came out a little bit more as a warming sensation, and the effect of the beer was drying. Overall, a great beer which was highly drinkable.","","Jul 27, 2006"

My bottle pours a slightly murky brown color with some glowing red highlights. Thick, bubbly tannish head and great retention and lacing in the glassware. Beautiful streaming carbonation. Nose is aggressive indeed. Strong hop notes, piney and some sour citrus. This is balanced by a thick, warm malt character. Smells terrific and in no way simple. Palate is likewise -- both thick, mouth-coating caramel malts with biting, resinous hops darting around. Complex palate that is so very complex. What is this beer? Falls into the elusive "strong ale" category. In other words, we don't know what it is, but it's something to be reckoned with ... Mouthfeel is thick and both smooth and biting. Aggressive carbonation and a lingering hop-bitter finish. What a complex creation. No wonder the bottle warns that this beer wasn't created for the "sniveling yellow beer drinking wimps."

The Arrogant Bastard poured out a brilliant dark shade of red, and I do mean dark. As far as color and appearance goes, this is one of the prettier beers I've ever seen. I could definitely smell the hops on this one, along with something else that could maybe be described as fruity, but the hops are prevalent for sure. The mouthfeel was a very pleasant sensation, very smooth, and the overall taste of the beer is like a swift kick to the taste buds. It comes on at first with a kind of sweet taste which is quickly followed up by all the hops that you got from the scent.

Smell is very floral, maybe roses and something sharp that hints at the bitterness to come. Taste is good, ALL hops. No malt within a mile of this one. The first taste is floral, maybe pine, then it rounds into a lovely, soft licorice-like roast that is not burnt at all. It sort of lulls you into complacency and then the bitterness comes on like a freight train, painting the back of the tongue with a burnt coffee sharpness. Not even something I can describe as aftertaste so much as a oral hangover. This is not my style (I suppose I live up to their "you're not worthy" motto) so I may be a bit jaded. Mouthfeel is very good, hits a good balance of roundness without being heavy. Drinkability - low. Low low low. I can't imagine making it through more than one in a session, just too much hops.

Arrogant Bastard has not been one of my favorite of the Stone lineup, but it is very good to say the least. I am drinking this from a 22oz bomber in a pint glass. It pours a deep mohagany with a nice tan head that last for a litte while. AB has a very nice aroma with hints of roasted malt and and grapefruit hoppiness. The flavor is aggressive with a good bit of hops upfront and nice malt middle with a slight hint of Belgian candied sugar. It has quite a bit of bittering hops in the end and aftertaste. The aftertaste is a little harsh due to the bitterness and a small amount of alcohol warming which effects the drinkability. AB has a nice medium body and is a very drinkable beer if you are into aggressive beers. This a very solid beer from Stone, but my favorite of the lineup is still Ruination.","ddarden","May 09, 2006"
4.04,-2.9,4,5,4,4,3,"Bottom line: good but not great. I'm just an old-school guy, and the over-the-top, IBU-flooded bitterness is just not for me. I love the fact that a Stone exists and that they're willing to push the envelope, but for me, the defining factor of a great beer is balance and harmony. While Arrogant Bastard offers that in its wonderfully inviting, strong but not overpowering, aroma--sweet and citrusy, that I pegged as grapefruit at first but then became more mango-like, with a very pleasant floral hop background--the flavor is just too bitter. As the beer warms, the complexity begins to come out in the background, but it's still dominated by the raw, even harsh, bitterness of the excessive hops--kind of like a good piece of music being overpowered by the bass being turned up way too high. If only the bittering hops were turned down, allowing some of the sweetness of the malt to come through, this would truly be a great beer. Or maybe it really is a great beer, and I'm just "not worthy".","petemorris","May 08, 2006"

Some decent bits of lacing left behind on the glass. Nose has a nice dose of citric hops as expected, but there is also a strong malt with hints of caramel, dark fruits and brown sugar. Taste meets expectations, starting with a nice full caramel malt, some toasted and nutty flavors detectable, and then giving way to a nice long bitter citrusy lemony hop finish Very nice, certainly hop heavy, but this beer has the malt backbone to keep up. Full bodied with a very nice smooth mouthfeel.

Flavor is of the toasty malts, lots of fruity esters (reminding me of the their porter), and a big finish of hops: grassy, floral, and earthy, with a pronounced aspirin bitterness that lingers on for a while.

This is my dad's favorite beer and he always has a case of 22oz. bottles out in his beer fridge. After trying this again today, I am so glad I have the palate to appreciate what Stone is doing here. Poured into what Stone calls their "Way Cool Glass"....it is pretty cool actually. A deep rich caramelized amber with a lingering sticky head and amazing staying power. Nose is very aromatic and complex with the expected sweet caramel malts and over the top hops, but unexpectedly a distinct fruity profile as well, strawberries? Taste is intense and as the label warns, not for the faint of heart or the macro swill drinking sissy....the over-the-top hop profile will definitely weed those folks out, however this is actually a fairly balanced recipe. The malts are very well done and full of sweetness which is present up-front and then are blown away by the fruit-juicy fresh hop taste and texture....only to come back again for the finish which leaves you smacking your lips with a slightly cloying sweetness. Really a complex and robust beer, worthy of the praise it recieves.","masikon","Jan 12, 2006"

The taste was much of the same, but balanced excellently, with a barrage of sweet caramel and roasted malts up front, fading into a spicy, bitter hop finish. I can not emphasize enough the complexity and balance of this beer. Since I had it in the larger bottle, and the ABV is decently high, AND the tastes are in your face, I wouldn't try to polish off more then one or two of these in one sitting.

Strong hoppiness is tasted immdeiately, but wait, there is a nice carmel sweetness on top of it to balance it out. The finish is crisp and bitter, but not overdone.

When I realized I've never gotten around to writing a review, I thought it would be fitting that I'll most likely earn my mug with this review. This bastard is a deep amber. It has fairly good clarity and a thick tan head forms from the pour. The aroma is powerful, resplendent with piney hops and an overriding maltiness that seems easily to be the equal of the hops. The taste is a wonderfully complex interplay of malty sweetness and hoppy biterness. The hops provide a piney oiliness that coats the tongue and creates an almost mouth puckering effect. This is cut rather quickly by the huge malt base that exists and all of a sudden I can't figure out whether the overriding taste is bitter or sweet. During the swallow, the alcohol provides a bit of a burn down the throat and warms the stomach. This beer is truly an experience. The aftertaste, mostly hops, lasts well after the swallow due to the mouth coating feel of the beer. Very sticky and chewy. The drinkability isn't great due to the stickiness and intense flavors. The 22oz bottle is plenty. Still, it's a beer I would never turn down.

It pours a cloudy tan head with a deep amber color- with a tinge of orange. This beer smells bittersweet. It has a very deep floral scent and multiple layers of hops. The hops definitely do not match the color of the beer. The smell prepares you for the hoppy bang you get from your first sip. It has a fantastic kick on the back of the tongue with the malt gently balancing it at the tip of the tongue. The tongue is lightly coated before it kicks you. This is a very hoppy, very potent beer.

A bit of warming alcohol sensation as well. The aftertaste is sour and lingers longer after each sip. A bit of astringent taste over time in the back of my throat.

Big toasted malt flavor upfront, followed by a very assertive herbal hop bitterness that will dry, then gracefully fade. A touch harsh towards the end, but the full body and low carbonation allow a slight residual sweetness from the malt that evens the bitter and dry hop finish.

Its lightly medicinal without being off-putting. The taste is huge but excellently balanced. The chewy, sweet malts are counterbalanced by the stinging bitter hops wonderfully.

Smells very fruity - pineapple juice, tropical hops, and some sweetness and bitterness. Tastes like pineapple and mango with piney and citric hops (predominantly grapefruit) that are very bitter but complement the flavors nicely.

The flavors in this beer simply did not work together. A very sweet caramel/butterscotch taste comes at first but then is soon drowned out by an intensely bitter, slightly piney hoppiness. The hoppiness holds and brings some alcohol fusels in with it and then on the finish the malt comes back with a sickening cloying syrup texture. The finish is horrible. I feel like I need to wash my mouth out with water. This beer is on the thin side and the body can't hold the flavors together.

No real hoppiness registering on the nose. A strong sweet malt backbone is the base of this one. Its full of caramel and dark fruits. A citric hop bitterness hits hard next. The bitterness is lingering and stays with the pallate for some time. The alcohol makes sure its presence known towards the end. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, great for the style.

The taste is hoptacular, but it's balanced well by a malty sweetness and candied fruit taste. The sweetness hides the alcohol pretty well, and then a nice hop and caramel interplay starts on your tongue. Quite entertaining. I'd label this one as medium-to-full bodied, and the complexities really shine through as it warms up a bit.

Smooth and quite creamy, with powerful and chewy resin-like pine flavors. The initial hop kick is followed-up with chunky sweet caramel malts, which are interwoven with the hop flavors through the drink. Chewy, smooth, and very satisfyingly creamy in the mouth.

There is little to no bitterness but it does finish slightly too syrupy and sticky. The mouthfeel is fuzzy and syruppy but still quite pleasant.

Malty and hoppy, balanced rather nicely. The hopping is piney and aggressive and the malt comes across as caramelly, biscuity and a little sweet at times.

Hop flavor lingers of the tongue long after a sip is finished. Arrogant Bastard's taste smooths out even more after it has warmed up a little. There is so much going on here it is hard to describe, but one thing is certain this is a world class beer. However, if you don't like west coast hopped beers, you probably won't like this.

I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. It reminded me of opening a sealed package of hop flowers at brew time. It poured a reddish brown color, with a perfect tan head. The head held till the end. Lacing means nothing to me, but if it did, this beer would be the definition of 'nice lacing'. This beer tastes great. It goes in smooth, and finishes with a dramatic hop bite. I sampled it at about 58°, and it popped. I think I will call that aunt, and tell her I love her.

It is very aggressive on the palate with the pine flavor of the hops leading the way. It is not offensive, but strong in a good way. The malt is very clean and crisp with notes of cherry, caramel and berries. The beer is very well hopped but it is not overdone. There is definately a great malt/hop balance that makes this beer splendid.","BrewMaster","Dec 09, 2004"

Pretty complex taste profile, with plum and grain prominent early, followed by lots of truly aggressive hops, coming on flowery, then coniferous, drowning out the malt and burying the fruit.

The citrus hop offerings come to life as she warms, just a touch dry, the body is very sweet and oh so smooth; the palate is cleansed by this massive brew! In addition, some sugary and cotton candy tastings left to graze the palate, add some raisin and oak flavorings  yeah youll find them all. Roasted malts and were hops mentioned?

Its sort of a rough transition when I first had the hop taste but it mellows and adds a degree of complexity to the beer that is amazing. This beer was very complex and full of flavor and body.

The head lasts and subsides lightly. The aroma features a heavy dose of malt along with some caramel notes and a slightly cooked syrup note - strangely I had trouble detecting much in the way of esters or hops. But flavorwise, I get a great thick maltiness coupled with a huge hop flavor, and a great complexity with nuances of cherry, chocolate, and toffee blending with clear malt presence and sharp bitterness. Again, though, the beer surprises me because I don't get quite a strike of bitterness at the end - overall the flavor is much more balanced and the hops seem more for flavor than bitterness.

The aroma is very strong with the pine hops, but has a caramel malt backing it up. The flavor is much more 'arrogant' from the bottle than from the tap. Less smooth.

4.65,11.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Definitely not a beer for the general masses, but what do they know, I love this stuff. Pours out a clear chestnut hue, a rich garnet when held to the light, damn sexy! Thick creamy off-white head, impressive retention with a tight cap almost all the way down. A tight wall of lacing also forms down the glass. The nose starts off with intense grapefruit rind hops, the malt gasps for breath as it quickly surfaces, only to be drowned in the hop goodness once again. Almost a bready malt presence, as fleeting as it is. The flavour is initially a smack-down of intense hops and grains, wrasslin' with one another, and you get so caught up in the action, it becomes pointless and far too distracting to begin breaking down the action into an anal play-by-play, you are simply swept along for the ride. A rich meaty malt becomes more apparent as the beer warms up, nearly toasted and caramel, making the gladiators easier to distinguish. Farther down the glass the flavour becomes more complex, but you get so caught up in the action that it takes a micro-biologist to create a spread-sheet for you to break down all the subtle moves and combinations into a discernable mode of operation. After a quick glance at the spread-sheet you are impressed, but proceed to throw it over your shoulder, in order to fully appreciate what is going on without being beaten over the head with the details. The flavour is duelling it out enough as it is. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, and very inviting considering the extremes of the flavour, a plush welcome mat that you want to use as a bath towel after stepping out of the hot tub with a few frisky members of your preferred gender of attraction. I want more of this stuff, and I want it now, I was a total mud-skipping retard for only grabbing one bottle of this in my travels.

Malt and hops fight it out for the nose. An immediate punch in the mouth of hops. Raisens, moist fruit cake, port? Very complex and intense. I savored every drop.

3.93,-5.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This was my first Stone beer and I finally understand all of the comments about how extreme they are. From a 22 oz. bomber bottle, it poured a beautiful mahogany color (one of the best looking colors I've seen), very clear, with a small head that remained in some capacity throughout the drink and left nice lacing as I drank. From the fridge, the aroma was slightly sweet with a big citrus punch and the smell of new carpeting (anyone else get that - beermail me). As it warmed, more malty aromas became evident - raisins, brown sugar, fresh bread. The taste at first nearly knocked me on my ass. I wasn't ready (and mabye "not worthy" as the bottle suggests) for what I experienced. The first taste started out slightly sweet and all of a sudden, my tongue was blasted with a bitterness I've never experienced before; it stayed with me for longer than any other bitter taste in my life. Cold from the fridge, this thing is a hop monster and seemingly nearly out of balance. As it warms, it really starts to come to life though. It gets sweeter and fruitier and either the bitter hops begin to fade or you just get used to the punch they pack... I'm still not sure. Either way, this is a very complex and balanced (but to the extreme) beer. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium bodied, smooth and creamy - really nice. I knocked it down a notch on drinkability because the flavors are so extreme that it can be challenging to drink and the high ABV starts warming you up pretty quickly. I drank the second part of this bomber alongside a bowl of really spicy, cajun (no tomatoes) jambalaya which contained andouille sausage, chicken, peppers and onions, drenched in hot sauce and it stood up to it and complimented it extremely well. This beer would be great alongside any big flavor foods.","oxmasterscream","Aug 27, 2004"

The taste is also big with malty sweetness and citrusy hops with a hint of rasins from the special B malt that I think they probably use. The mouthfeel is pure bliss for big beer/big hops lovers.

Heavily roasted and malty aromatics fill my nose. Flavor opens up bitter and spicy, and then the rich and roasted character appears again with a nice layering of hop flavor and finishes with a malty sweetness. This beer is so unique, the flavor profile is really unlike any other beer I have ever tried. Mouthfeel is medium to full and leaves a slight sticky coating on the throat, warming as it goes down.

At first the hops lie dormant, lulling you into a false sense of security. But they quickly rise up and pounce upon your unsuspecting palate. This hop bitterness isn't going anywhere and it stays entrenched on your palate all the way through the finish. Delightful. Excellent mouthfeel and carbonation.

This beer goes down really, really easy with a clean crisp finish. I would probably go so far as to say the Arrogant Bastard is the Great Wallenda of balanced ales (well, before his tragic end anyway.)

Etched glass instead of the typical stick-on label. This is a collector's item bottle. The smell is strong with tons of sweet malt and maybe some honey. Quite nice. Taste is a complex mixture of overwhelming malty sweetness that is quickly extinguished by a huge bitterness. The finish is strongly bitter and fairly dry. The bitterness lasts several minutes beyond your most recent swallow... if you can wait that long that is! Mouthfeel is exactly what I like... it is something akin to eating a sandwhich. Carbonated to just the right amount...not even close to flat, but definitely not overly carbonated. This is not your average beer by a far stretch. I actually attempted to homebrew a batch of beer that tasted fairly similar to Arrogant Bastard. The difference? Stone Brewery got it right and I really screwed it up! This is one for the books... drink it alone, with friends, at a movie, in the park... you can't go wrong with this one. But a word of caution... this isn't for everyone (just like the bottle says).

A little more of any one, and I'd have to slow way down. My highly subjective impression is that none of the elements (hops, malt, booze) seem integrated into the other elements, but rather are simply opposed to each other in near-perfect balance -- or as if all three were trying to get through a doorway at once and were hindering each other's prgress.

Poured a dark garnet copper red colour with a dirty sand-like head. The head faded away to a thin film quickly. The smell is a little sweet, a bit fruit, date or raisin like actually, and definately complex. The texture of the taste is very smooth and almost silky.

Taste starts as a malty cocoa, toasted grain flavor, and finishes with a really spicy kick from the hops and a bitter, warming alcohol effect at the very end.

I really mean that. At 7.2% this is a serious brew but man the deep chestnuts, smokiness, ripe fruit, pine, citrus... very serious brew. The initial taste reminded me of another brew "Black Douglas" which is actually a Scotch brew where the alcohol was very prevalent, but the malty sweetness really balanced it out --- the big difference with this brew was the intense hop bitterness that just kept on coming but never overpowered the other flavors. This is no hype, no lie, on my top 5 of best all around brews. I think a case of bombers is warranted... and just think, I've still got Double Bastard hanging out in the cellar.... sweet!

A taste delight, once past the lips, the beer drips with flavor-toasty malt, a wonderfull fruitiness mid-palate adds a kiss of sweetness. A well balanced, while never delicate brew. A twangy, peppery, highly assertive hop bitter prevails on the mile long finish.

Finishes with hops lingering in your mouth. The beer has lived up to hype and is worth seeking out if you can't get it locally. The intersting thing is the beer seems to change as it gets warmer, the hops almost seperate themselves into different flavor categories as the temperature increases.

Aftertaste remains for a long time. I'm searching for anything other than the strong bitter hops taste. I thought I got a little citrus undertones on the first sip but that doesn't seem present in the second. I'm probably drinking a little warmer than ideal serving temperature.

It's malt, it's hops, and it delivers both in a smooth blend. And there is just no way that one is enough, no matter the sign on the bottle.

Lightly carbonated, this beer is semi-sweet with a subtle bitter aftertaste. I discovered flavors such as the bitter of grapefruit (which I didn't really like since I don't like grapefruit) and the bite of baking chocolate. Thumbs up to this brew. Sadly though I won't be drinking much of this, since it is wildly overpriced at the only local store that sells it ($5 for a bomber). Way to go Stone!","RocketWidget","Mar 19, 2004"

Lace is also quite minimal, and the beer has very still appearance in general. Aroma is on the sweetish side with flowery hops and malts that smell like honey. I can also detect a fair bit of grain on the nose with hints on vanilla and oak. Malt profile is very Scottish with sweet caramel, plum, cherry, vanilla, and a bit of smoked grain. Hops are quite detectable, and become more pronounced as the beer warms some. The hops add some dryness to the aftertaste due to their spicy, woody character, but they are not really bitter. As the beer gets warmer still, the malts that had been subdued by the hops make a big comeback with very fruity esters. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a nicely warming alcohol content. A sipping beer to wind down a stressful day at work, as the experience is totally relaxing and mellow.","rajendra82","Mar 10, 2004"

This one is both and then some. Pours a unique ruby-brown color with a respectable amount of head and some active carbonation. From the moment the beer hits the glass, the smell bloodies your nose with a barrage of grapefruit. As the beer warms and the citrus hops scatter a bit, some pleasant malts are detectable as well. The grapefruit notes carry over to the taste, but the flavors evolve nicely over time. By the time I was done, the hops were fading to a dry Scotch-like malty flavor. In between is something of a caramely balance of flavors. Resins cling a lot at first though not unpleasantly. As the taste gives way to malts, the mouthfeel likewise gives way to a richer, softer texture. Despite its intensity, this one is very drinkable.

Smell is of slight alcohol with a wafting of hops to warn you that this beer is not to be messed with. My nonick pint is still trembling from the pour. Taste- Taste is- thick, not quite chewy malt goodness overtaken by serious hoppyness, with alcohol mixing in with the hops before giving way to a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. This begs to be sipped again. Not too quickly, though, as seven percent is more than most mere mortals can manage. Slight carbonation, not overpowering at all- heck, it's there, but with beer this good, you're going to be concerned with other hoppening matters.

There are alot of strong flaovors in here (sweet malt, caramel, hops and spice) and they all complement each other wonderfully. On top of all that, it's just one ass-kicker of a beer, in ABV and big taste. I am always suspicious of "gimmicky" ad campaigns but Arrogant Bastard is a perfect name for this brew.

Hops of course are the dominant flavor, so tart and bitter, but they also become fruity and bolster the caramel sweetness from the malts. Still if you don't like bitter beers you probably won't enjoy this. I like them generally, and enjoyed this beer, but a growler is perhaps too much of a good thing. Also the hop bitterness aroused my appetite (as hoppy beers are wont to do), but when it came time to eat something my taste buds were completely stripped from the beer.

It has a thick, heavy texture that is surprisingly easy to drink. The hop/malt balance is nice, sweet malt with a citrus hop flavor that finishes toasty with a smooth hop bitterness. It doesn't have a very complex malt flavor but more a base to hold complex hop flavor and bitterness.It is a bit heavy but enough fun by itself to quaff a few with snacks.

The aroma is definitely not for the faint of heart. A healthy punch of hops attacks the olfactory senses, leaving them begging for mercy. Slight aromas of fruit and alcohol are also detected. The bold taste of hops will beat down your taste buds and have them screaming Uncle. This is one vastly complex brew, I didnt think that anyone could put that much hops into one beer. Am I worthy?

Strong aromas of citrusy hop and fresh wort sweetness and ....more stuff. Initial flavors of juicy plums and cherries with maple and brown sugary grain that quickly blends easily with intense hop flavors of fresh oranges and ground pepper. This beer is aggressivly and arrogantly hopped yet still achieves just amazing balance. The strong, bitter finish is softened by left over roasty sweetness that makes you suck at the roof of your mouth to suckle every drop. I can honestly say I enjoyed this bottled version just as much ( tho, side by side taste test would be cool) the draft I sampled at the now infamous Blind Tiger 12, 12 @ 12 NYC Stone event.

The front is a slap-in-the face, bitter piney taste but this gives way to a full, sweet, malty middle (not that the hops go away, mind you).

It pours a gorgeous deep mahogany in the glass with a massive, rocky, light tan head leaving a whole lotta lace. The aroma whacks you in the nose with brown sugary malt, fruity esters (some pineapple) and citrusy hops. In the taste, Malt and Hops are nicely balanced, though the ostentatious bitterness is a bit overwhelming at first. It's best to let this brew flex its muscles (i.e. breathe) for a few minutes. Huge caramel and fruit show up in the taste (like caramel coated apples) with plenty of citric hoppy bitterness to keep the brew from being cloyingly sweet. It loses points in drinkability just for being such a hugely rich and heavy brew. I'm full and content, no need for another.","johnrobe","Dec 23, 2002"

The first taste startled me not because of the hops, but because of the excellent balance of maltiness and bitterness. Strong caramel notes were followed by an intense hop presence that left a lingering mitterness on the aftertaste. Every taste followed the same malt - citrus - bitterness trend, from beginning to end of the glass. The mouthfeel was very full, but yet somewhat refreshing with the heavy hop finish.

4.78,14.9,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I must say, this one starts to impress while it's still being poured!  Burnt amber color topped by a huge sticky tan head that stays almost endlessly.  Leaves tons of lace as the glass is emptied.  Grand aroma of ultra-citrusy hops, as well as piney hop character.  Just a little sweet malt backs it all up.  The first taste is a war between malt and hops, both in full force.  Rich and sweet maltiness comes on strong, along with sharp spears of citrus and rind-like hop bitterness.  Hints of spicy alcohol.  Grainy malt and bitter hop finish.  It's usually hard to find that complexity in the finish of a beer.  Tingly yet smooth mouthfeel.  Not one part of the experience of this beer lacks flavor.  Yes, that means a full body, this is one of the most full-bodied beers I've ever tasted.  An aggressive beer that doesn't even think of holding back.  Most are not worthy of this brew.  I say bring on the arrogance!","hyuga","Oct 03, 2002"
4.6,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Thanks to Xlperro for the sample.  Nice dark color with a thick tanish head.  Nice hop smell.  I first notice the citrusy grassy hops, yet the maltiness is right there too.  Great drinkability, I could drink this all night, if it wasn't for the 7+ alcohol. I love it.","jtw5877","Sep 27, 2002"
4.23,1.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Arrogant Bastard: damn straight I’m worthy.  Huge beer, hops, malts, aroma and alcohol.  Seems a little rough around the edges, but a balanced taste.   Long lasting cider/coffee aftertaste, and  alcohol warmth.  Very nice.","jackndan","Sep 26, 2002"
4.12,-1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is one harsh and  potent beer, but quite good at the same time. It pours a dark brown color with a nice fizzy light brown head. The brew smells very hoppy with a slight spice hint. The first sip leaves the mouth exploding in hop flavor. then suddenly the mouth is overwhelmed by a fruity grapefruit flavor mixed with clove. The beer finishes very harsh, but not in a bad way. This would be a good beer for a cool fall night.","usualpulp","Sep 18, 2002"

4.8,15.4,5,5,5,5,4,"Oh baby, this is a fantastic beer. Beautiful rich copper/brown with a frothy tan head; luscious. Exceptional fruity aromas, almost tropical, with some grapefuit balanced by some caramel sweetness. Taste is also fruity (guava?), grapefruity, slightly piney. Huge malt backbone in this beer gives it a sweetness that envelopes your tongue. But in the end hops rule, and the beer finishes with a bitter hop twang that makes you wonder whether you're worthy. I am, dammit.","mophie","Sep 02, 2002"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The first thing I noticed was intense pineapple and grapefruit smells.   Grapefuit was very obvious in the mouth as was some pleasing malt sweetness that was kept in check by a fair amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel was slightly lighter than the bottled version.","jreitman","Aug 31, 2002"
4.28,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I was expecting a butt kicking hop explosion from this bastard, which would of been excellent, but to my surprise there was enough malt backbone to highlight but not overpower the superb bitterness. Fruity and medium bodied with an initial grapefruit rind bitterness followed by some caramel and toasted grains, this was deceptively light and refreshing giving it's relatively high alcohol content. Finished with more flavorful but curiously balanced hop notes. I could of pounded a few of these, but it was too far to walk home.","QXSTER1","Aug 24, 2002"
4.88,17.3,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Heed the warning on the label non-believers, because this is one tough beer that is only meant for the big boys. The pour was dark and thick, the head was dark and thick, and the taste is like a malt explosion in your mouth. Stone is probably the God's of mixing water, hops, malt and yeast together. They haven't failed me yet.","sinistersteve","Aug 23, 2002"
4.23,1.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Creamy, thick light tan sticky head tops a dark ruby hued brew w/ excellent clarity.  Countable rings of bubbles interconnected by lace is left down the glass.  Quite attractive.  The aroma is a combination of a citrus hop nose and dark caramel malt, biscuit malt and a hint of diacetyl.  Mild hints of roasted grain are present as well.  Assertive hop bitterness hits the palate initially, but quickly gives way to a fairly rich malt profile comprised of deep caramel and toffee, buttery malt, and mellow dark fruity esters.  The piney chinook hop flavor is not obtrusive, and melds well with the caramel malt and hints of darker roasted barley.  Overall the flavor balance is skewed towards hop bitterness and flavor, but only slightly.  Full in body, w/ well calculated smooth carbonation that helps accenuate the malt profile.  Finishes w/ toasted malt quickly fading and clean hop bitteress lingering.  Arrogant Bastard is an aggressively hopped brew with a rich malt foundation.  It's not unlike Red Rocket ale, albeit with less roasted barley and a slightly higher hop bitterness.  Very tasty.","marc77","Aug 13, 2002"
4.95,19,5,5,5,4.5,5,"untill the next day.  Friday I pour it into a pilsner glass and witness a beautiful glass of beer.  The color was a nice copper,  the head was thick and foamy with tight small bubbles and the stayed on and didn't dissipate at all.  The taste was so smooth I couldn't believe I was drinking 7.2 % ale.  This beer is so well brewed I could find no faults with.  I am not sure if there are some Cigar smokers out there, if so this is the beer to enjoy with your best cigars.    FS.","Bogie","Aug 10, 2002"
5,20.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Great deep copper color. Tastes much different than I expected. Upon the look, it looks like it would be very heavy but it actually isn't. Don't get me wrong,this beer is strong and very bitter and hoppy. It is one of the most perfectly balanced beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. I much prefer it alone because food tends to alter the great taste. Brilliant! Perfect!","Jdiddy","Jul 30, 2002"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The body is a hazy orangish-copper with crimson highlights, and its full and foamy tan head holds quite well. It drops to a thin 1/4" that remains throughout the first half of the glass, and it leaves dense, clinging rings of lace.The beautiful colr and head make up for any distraction that the haziness might cause the inexperienced taster. The bouquet wafts from the glass loaded with fresh hops (somewhat earthy and leafy, but also clearly citrusy... Goldings and Cascade?) over rich caramel malt. The firm body is accentuated by an exceptionally fine carbonation and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich and fairly complex with a sweet caramel and lightly fruity malt note up-front that combines with earthy and citrusy hop flavors as it crosses the palate. It finishes with a firm, drying bitterness and residual earthy and leafy hop flavors. If there's anything that hinders it's drinkability (apart from the fact that it's a full-charged malt & hop attack!) it's the 7.2% alcohol by volume. I may not be able to drink more than two, but I want to drink more than two! Well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Jul 24, 2002"

I found it on tap at my favorite bar.  I thought I was ready for the intense flavor of this beer....I was wrong.  The hops were intense and the citrus aroma was excellent.  The malt helps to offset the inital assult of the hops to make it a well balanced brew.  Not fot the faint of heart.","coffeybreak","Jun 08, 2002"

It has an interesting flavor to it. A flavor of malt, hops and carmel. A bit stronger than I like my beers unless they're heavier to offset the taste of alcohol. So the finish was a bit heavy alcohol wise, but still another fine Stone product.c","Wildman","May 25, 2002"

Damn fine brew and highly recommended.","Murph","May 11, 2002"

I detected a strong taste of grapefruit in this brew coming from the hops yet has a strong malty backbone to balance it out. Did I say "balance" in an AB review? . It has a very nice appearance of caramel color brew with a 3 finger head that shrunk down but lasted to the last drop [maybe I drank it too fast ;-) ]. I also liked the bottle for the size, the content and the label. Maybe they are using a little reverse psychology on some unsuspecting peeps. It was however, a fun experience.

3.6,-13.5,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Watch out, this one will smack you upside the head if you're not ready.  Pours with a big tan head, the beer is ruby brown in color.  Smells sweet, citric, alcoholy and slightly musty, which is odd beacuse this beer should have been fresh (I ordered it online at Beer on the Wall and tried it three days after receiving it).  Almost no carbonation.  From the first sip the alcohol makes its presence known.  Bitter throughout with a nutty-bitter slightly astringent aftertaste, which really lingers.  A faint mustiness can be tasted, which seems odd and out of place.  A real hoppy kick in the crotch.  I wanted to like this beer more, and I consider myself a hophead, but it was a little too bitter/astringent without enough balancing maltiness for me.","htomsirveaux","Mar 27, 2002"

Nice creamy foam pitted head this time. Too dark to be called off-white. Body is reddish brown, nice but not exceptional. Aroma is some sweet malt and a slightly pine-liek hop bite. Flavor bites first, a little interesting maltiness in the middle and some fruitiness (I could have sworn it was peach there a couple of times, but it became more vague after that) It ends with a fairly short, bitter finish.","aracauna","Mar 26, 2002"

Dark amber brownish in color with a caramel colored head, the bubbles have a look of an oil slick to them.  Starts off semi sweet and malty then turns down right bitter in the finish.  The flavor lasts and lasts minutes after you swig.  This brew has the most fitting name.  Complex and has tons of character.  Even though the drinkability is a joke, it deserves high marks because of this paradox.  Great winter brew!","Jordan","Nov 28, 2001"

From the smell to the taste to crazy things you do after four or five pints, this beer is first class. Really, all of Stone's beers are great, but there is just a little something extra about this one. But then, I am always a sucker for a big, hoppy faux-IPA type of ale.

As stated on the label, if you do not have the "taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth" then you may not like it. Or rather, go drink your safe beer wimp. It's rather aggressive, but oh so damn good (in an evil, not worthy way). Just beware before you drink. This beer is not for the faint of heart.","Todd","Nov 15, 2000"
