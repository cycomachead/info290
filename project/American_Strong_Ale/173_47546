I'm not a fan of smoky beers but the huge sweetness and barrel aging has tempered the smoked malts quite well. Don't get me wrong, it's still smoky and meaty but it's tolerable for me.

Sweet, bourbon, candy-like aromas. Some woody and apple notes are noticeable as well. Lots of complexity here. Smells absolutely delicious. First taste is insane. Feels thin and basically flat. Some heat is obvious, along with delicious bourbon and apple brandy barrel flavors. The finish is wood and smoke, but somehow in an incredible way for me. This beer is really throwing me for a loop, as it is unlike anything I've had before. But I am really enjoying it. This was my only bottle, but I will have to get more. This would age VERY well. Overall, Hair of the Dog has blown my mind yet again, this time with the most recent release of Matt. Can't wait to try Otto. Cheers!","brother_kenneth","Oct 21, 2013"

I knew I would like it because 99% of the beer they make is fantastic, but this immediately vaulted into my top 5. maybe it was the 3 years of aging, but this was just a masterpiece of what a barrel aged strong ale can be. sweet but not too sweet. Boozy, but not over the top. almost tastes like some sort of sweet liqure blended with the malt and hops of a beer. just nothing like it. The Cherry Adam from the wood had similar qualities, but this beer did it without any added fruit. I now see why people were lined up to buy cases of the 2013 batch.","derftron","Oct 13, 2013"

What is remarkable about this beer is how the elements of taste surge and fade like voices in counterpoint. Smells of sweet bourbon and light raisins greet the nose and they linger over dried apple and smoke. The taste comes and goes: a sharp dried apple sweetness, a slight alcoholic edge that pervades, a deeper sweetness of molasses and milk chocolate, smoke and charred oak, finishing on a quiet chocolate astringency. The body is medium to thick, the beer is sweet, not cloying, and in the delicate interplay of powerful flavours is one remarkable beer.","cmadd","Dec 18, 2012"

The nose on this one is complex and smells like something I've had before but can't out my finger on. It features sweet malt, molasses, maple syrup, leather, tobacco, figs, oak, and light smoke. The flavors are almost identical. It's slightly dry so I get plenty of spicy tobacco and oak up front. It's followed by figs, plum, and raisin. It just has this earthiness about it. I really dig it. It drinks like an old ale and doesn't feature any alcohol at all. It drinks medium in body and coats your palate. It's really enjoyable.

The number of flavors this thing presents is incredible, and it strikes a surprisingly impressive balance between all of them. Hop, malt, booze all get their turn here, and all add up to a very impressive concoction. Definitely over-the-top sticky and cloying, so beware of that, but the sheer breadth of diversity in the flavor profile in this is awesome.

This would work much better in a small, small serving. It is fairly complex with a host of sugary sweet flavors to it, but it is just too overpowering for its own good.

4.62,3.6,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Poured from the bottle into a few taster glasses. Color was the darkest of browns, maroon around the edges, opaque, no head to speak of, although light swirling produced a tiny bit of unexpected lacing. Nice aroma, indicative of the complexity that I'd soon be tasting: dark fruits and lots of them, booze, wood, esters, thick dark malts. Lots of sumptuous dark fruit in the taste--raisins, prunes, figs--no disguising the booze, smooth chocolate (lingered into the aftertaste), with hints of smoke and herbal hops. All things considered, the mouthfeel was amazingly smooth and velvety; obviously you want to let this one sit on the palate and get the full gambit of flavors from it. Very nice, and very savorable. I have a couple extra bottles of this that I'm going to let age for a while. Should be interesting to see how they taste in a few years, but they're obviously ready for consumption now.","Rifugium","Jan 23, 2012"

Ugly but cute at the same time, I like it Aroma is definately on the spirit/oak side of things, strong notes of molasses and vanilla. Taste is very, very sweet. I was afraid a little by the aroma, I thought we were on our way to a boozy mess, but the taste is so boldly sweet, with no off flavors at all, just a warm, sweet, monster sipper. Lots of calvados flavour, toffee, caramel. Palate is completely flat, good alcohol warmth, so long and silky in the mouth. I guess this is perfect for a cold winter evening, but it worked well for us on a hot july afternoon.

The brew pours a near-still cola-brown hue; there is no head or bubbles but the liquid is viscous enough to leave slight legs upon the glass. The look is rustic and menacing. The nose is, on the contrary, the most absolutely inviting thing imaginable; the complexity is literally astounding. There is a plethora of sensory delights to behold within the flavor and aroma of Matt. Notes of charred brown sugar, toffee, raisin-dark fruit, cherries, hardwood smoke, tannic oak, buttery vanilla, booze, leather, and that familiar HotD twang - just to mention the most prominent associations - all make for a very familiar set of elements but they are combined here in an unusual and novel way. The feel is more lively than the look suggests, and is quite silky as well. Overall this is far and away the best HotD brew I've had (and that is saying something because I've had some great ones.)

Mouthfeel was slick, low carb and full bodied. My fears of a 2011 CAftW-letdown were quickly quashed after a couple drinks. This was a real pleasure to drink and, having just finished my glass I'm sure I'm going to try to chase another one of these down in the future.

This beer straddles a very interesting divide, showcasing both deep, smoky, dark toastiness as well as bright, green, fruity overtones. As a genre-blending experiment, it succeeds - I've never had a beer quite like this, to be sure. And not to sell it short - it succeeds on several other levels too, least of which is the divine nose and the masterful blending and complexity of the mouth. But I still require lift, head, lace, et al - this one had its procedural defects, and though they're not glaring, they do take their toll; it was a little difficult to finish those essentially flat final few sips. Of course, all that being said, this was still a pretty damn awesome beer - it's not every day you're going to get this many flavors and aromas out of a single 12 oz. bottle.

A lot going on in there. Feels like I could keep sipping it and get more flavors. Really heavy in the mouth with limited carbonation.

4.87,9.2,4.5,5,5,4,5,"The smell alone is sublime, projecting notes of apple cured chewing tobacco, cherries, port wine and plum. The flavor blends notes of licorice, fig, vanilla, molasses, and woodsmoke while a distant glow of alcohol adds an ideal measure of heat. Just the thought of this exotic and seductive, motor oil-black ale has me drifting into a state of beer bliss. I can't imagine how high the gravity must have been to ferment out at 11.5% ABV while still retaining a plush body and considerable sweetness. But this is a rock solid beer that exceeds ordinary comparisons. It's pure magic.","RedDiamond","Feb 25, 2010"
3.89,-12.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,3,"Having said that, the complexity is there and this would make for a really nice sipper. Very low carbonation, but not flat. Medium bodied with a good substance to it. Both the booze and flavor profile command small sips... oh yeah and the price tag and it's availability. Glad I got to try it, but probably won't seek it out again in the future. I bet it will age nicely though.","Ineedabeerhere","Feb 20, 2010"
4.12,-7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Hair of the Dog comes up with some great ales. Pours very dark with a small but significant off-white head, and there is lace down the glass.

Bourbon and a tad of sugar in the aftertaste, that is somewhat drying.","Sammy","Jan 30, 2010"

On the palate, its very lowly carbonated and has a syrupy, liqueur type consistency, and an over the top burn from the alcohol.

3.92,-12.1,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"D: Very interesting idea and probably will get better down the road but this is almost a mess. Very tasty flavors that are being covered up by the raw alcohol. Wouldn't have guessed 11.5% from the nose but it actually seems like more in the taste. I actually warmed up to the beer a bit more the more that I drank. The alcohol mellows a touch as it opens up further and you get a bit of raw, meaty, smoked meat flavor in the back, adding some nice depth. Mix that with the wood.","pwoods","Nov 30, 2009"
4.52,1.3,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"The beer pours the expected dark brown color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is as intense on tap as it was out of the bottle, with prunes, apple brandy, licorice, chocolate and coffee. As the beer warmed (I really think they were serving this beer too cold at Brouwers) I got additional chocolate, as well as some more apple and vanilla. Flavors replicate the nose, except this beer really smoothed out and became very creamy after it warmed a bit. I actually found it a bit astringent and angular initially, but with time and warming, the beer dramatically improved. As with the bottle version, the mouthfeel is very rich and full, and was just exceptional once it warmed a bit. Drinkability is pretty good, though the alcohol and sweetmess really make this a sipper. Also, after having this both in bottle and on tap, I really think this beer needs time to show it's very best. It's delicious now, but I think in a year or two, will turn into a real gem. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from HOTD.","John_M","Nov 29, 2009"

4.77,7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Aroma is strongest of apples, both sweet and tart. Some tart apples and hay, as well as some sweet apple pie with spices. Brandy like booziness in the aroma as well. Strong deep chocolate and some yeastiness in the aroma as well. Taste is very strong of apple brandy, absolutely delicious. The apples mix with sweet chocolate up front, though the chocolate keeps more to the background. Some spices come in mid taste, cinnamon? The brandy takes the fore front in the finish with a nice spicy, peppery heat on the tongue and throat, with some wood, and oak notes. Mouthfeel is fairly full, the sweetness would be somewhat cloying if not for the apple and the heat. Low carbonation, spicy, peppery alcohol on the tongue and a drying finish. Extraordinary beer, unique flavors that come together very well. Not sure if this was done partly in brandy barrels, but the apple brandy flavor is strong and very nice.
