3.61,-2.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I wasn't feeling the caramel-toffee malt and for certain, the piney hops were weak at best and only noticeable in the aftertaste for a brief moment. Maybe it was the high carbonation that did this beer in, as it felt like a soda with some booze and yeast thrown in for good measure. I wouldn't call this a drain pour as much as it an underwhelming let-down. Yes, American Strong Ales can vary in their flavor profile and strength but in this instance, I felt that this beer was categorized incorrectly. Fans of Boulevard should still give this a go, because it's a fairly solid beer from top to bottom. Where it falls in their portfolio is the bigger question...","JerzDevl2000","Feb 14, 2015"

The nose is faint with a light wisp of grape, light very ripe fruit, pine and light sugars. You first notice the toffee aromas, then grape to chardonnay followed by pine. A thread of light toffee runs all the way through the palate supported by light fruit with some piney bitterness on the finish. Nicely balanced.

It's a great golden ale, not too heavy, very smooth, and I want more.  I've heard the Boulevard version is the one in bottles and is a little maltier, as compared to the Odell version that is on tap and tends to run a little hoppier.  So keep that in mind if you are looking around; they may be slightly different depending on which brewery made it and how you are drinking it.
