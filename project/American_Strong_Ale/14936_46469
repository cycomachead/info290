The beer has a lot of good whiskey flavors going on but the components are also shining brightly.  A little more heft in the mouth would have been nice though.","SHODriver","Mar 15, 2015"

Smell is of toasted malt, citrus zest, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice barrel aged qualities all around.","UCLABrewN84","May 10, 2014"

It looks like a stout but smells/tastes strong of american barleywine. It makes sense after reading the blend description but it is strange how the stout aspect is all in the looks and the barleywine dominates every other aspect of the brew except the aftertaste hints towards stout. This is worth trying but not getting crazy over. Unless you are a fan of boozy black ipas, then it is worth flipping your shit over.","stakem","Oct 13, 2013"
