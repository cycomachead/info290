Which happens to be one of my favorite beers so that means I like it, I like it a lot.  Very well balanced, not too much heat, lots of deep flavor and bourbon characteristics, creamy vanilla and sweet chocolate.

Heat from the bourbon and abv is warming but not so overwhelming that you miss the notes of chocolate and some vanilla. Slightly sweet too (with dark brown sugar notes). Really delicious.","MtnSoup","Feb 27, 2015"

Taste was brown sugar, vanilla, and a chocolate covered cherry finish.  It was a little light in the mouth, but still satifying.  Overall this was an outstanding beer. In the same class as parabola and bcbs.","OneEye78","Feb 07, 2015"

3.98,-10,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"What boots this rating down for me a little bit is that the mouthfeel is quite cloying and syrupy. The flavor is good overall: love the bourbon vanilla but it is a bit sweet for my tastes. A 4 oz pour would have been perfect. It's the syrupy, muddled finish that keeps the beer from an upper echelon rating for me. There are many breweries across the country that can create a barrel aged beer that finishes well all the way through the taste experience. This one doesn't finish well with that caramel-ly syrupy finish.","terabin","Jan 23, 2015"

Wonderful aroma of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and a fig or date smell that is reminiscent of a barleywine. Taste is delicious; you get a nice amount of bourbon but not overpowering. Other tastes of vanilla, caramel, subtle chocolate, and again that fruity/fig-like essence. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth, nicely carbonated. Overall, this is a special treat that does not seem as big as it feels after imbibing 11oz of this toasty goodness.","LouZ","Jan 08, 2015"

I'd like a little more spice and perhaps a little more roasted malt flavour. This is nonetheless a wonderfully crafted brew, and, if it weren't for my preference for the flavour profile of stouts, (more chocolate, peat and coffee) this might score even higher. The abv. is entirely an afterthought. A must try, particularly if you like vanilla and bourbon.","abeeronthebeach","Jun 20, 2014"

This ale appears pitch black with a smooth, tan, minimal head. There are ultra-fine bubbles that seem to melt from the sides as I move the ale around in my brandy snifter. As I give the drink some time to settle, the head has retreated back into a halo, with a spotty, uneven, smooth, fine cover of bubbles. The smell is of sweet vanilla, caramel, and a hint of alcohol, nothing else. The taste is rich, delicious, and decadent, like a fine desert. There is vanilla, light caramel, spice, molasses, and an obscure, taste of booze/alcohol/bourbon. The mouthfeel is faintly sizzling with sweet feedback. No bitter taste, no after taste, no complaints. Only recommendations.","mabermud","Jun 10, 2014"

The chicory root flavor isn't my favorite, but the smooth and rich flavors are very nice, it's just a touch on the earthy side and it could use a bit more body.

4.42,0,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage. Pours fairly pitch black color with a small tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, toast, dark bread, pepper, clove, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toffee, raisin, brown sugar, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, toffee, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, cinnamon, dark bread, clove, vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, brown sugar, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of malt, spice, and barrel flavors; with huge robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged winter ale! All around incredible balance and complexity of dark malt, spice, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly amazing offering as expected.","superspak","Sep 19, 2013"

Pours a dark brown/almost-black appearance with a half inch off-white head that dissipates within the next minute. The nose picked up oaky vanilla, light undertones of licorice, figs, mild chocolate, and bourbon. The flavor packs a nice, smooth, but a wallop of bourbon heat and goodness along with some caramel, chocolate, chocolate malts. Medium to just pre-thick mouthfeel with a nice stickiness to it. Nice, smooth, and warming backfinish with some pleasant bourbon heat. I was sure glad this beer was classified as a winter warmer because this bit a piece of Hardywood GBS (and the bourbon version as well) from behind for the all-time winter beers I've had to date. A really nice job by Fremont Brewing.","CuriousMonk","Jan 04, 2013"

In fact, it reminds me very much of Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout, perhaps with a slightly less decadent base beer. If you haven't figured it out by now, the fact that I am comparing this to BCBS means it is an outstanding brew. The effort and care that went into creating this is apparent from the first sip. Haven't had Kentucky Dark Star, but I am seriously ISO after Abominable here. If it is anything like this, than Fremont may just have a barrel program on its hands that rivals Goose Island and Firestone Walker. Very well done.","siege06nd","Dec 31, 2012"

Fantastic flavors - bourbon, vanilla and a buttery quality on a nice malty backbone - dark fruits are interspersed nicely through the flavor profile.

This is a bourbon sandwich, it starts with that classy bourbon bite, before mellowing into an exceptional winter ale, with the caramel, coffee, and chocolate flavors prevalent before giving way to the crumbling intensity of the bourbon on the back end. As this baby quickly disappears, it leaves vanilla and bourbon heat trickling viciously.
