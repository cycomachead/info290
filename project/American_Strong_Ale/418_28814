While this beer has an awesome heat I'd expect from a strong ale, and a super nice, fresh hoppiness and ALSO some solid balance, the price is just kind of crazy to me, especially since it's not even barrel-aged or anything. If this were a bit cheaper, I'd probably score it higher, as unfair as that probably is. I really do like the taste of this one though, it just doesn't warrant the price tag -- fresh hops, warming alcohol, nice combo of both sweet and bitter... pretty nice beer.","Alextricity","Jan 10, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine/grassy hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, citrus peel, pine, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine/grassy hops and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately crisp/sticky, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial ESB style. All around great balance and complexity of citrus/pine/grassy hops and dark/bready malts; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 02, 2014"

The nose comprises wet cardboard and buttery toffee backed by some very light orange peel. The taste holds notes of dry biscuit, orange peel, light earthy greens, very light tobacco, and a general sense of something musty hanging around, malingering in pain. It's an improvement on the smell, but that ain't sayin' much. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours gold with a nice white head. A huge malt forward aroma offering some butterscotch taffy, a little nutty, a slight infusion of some fruit, and a little hops in the finish. Flavor is defined by the malt offering a big butterscotch taffy base that is supported by some nut, some fruit (citric in nature) and a ever so slight bitter, hoppy finish. Alcohol is disguised quite well in this.. A fuller, creamy body. Overall, I generally don't enjoy butterscotch but had no problems with this one here, this was definitely one of the better non-dark beers by Left Hand. Would gladly drink this one again.","denver10","Oct 16, 2012"

There is a nice bitter balance that keeps you coming back for another drink. I will say this is one of the more complex and mysterious tasting beers that I have had, there is a spicy brown sugar taste that is interesting. I cannot get over the drinkability.

I loved it! Brown sugar, burnt caramel, slight fruity accents in the background, some hints of lemon/lime and a good dosage of hops that are present, but in no way can keep up with the malts. This was one bad boy indeed. Very thick and full bodied, with a nice amount of carbonation.

The smell is very malty; a nice roasted presence with a slight pineapple hop aroma. The taste is a nice mellow toasted/roasted malt, caramel, spice, and a very light hint of port. The feel is moderate to full, the carbonation is on the soft side and the finish is excellent, well balanced. Alcohol is well hidden. This is a very fine American ale, well constructed. I need to pick me up an extra bottle or so to age. Looking forward to trying their other 750ml offerings.","Gmann","Mar 19, 2008"

It had a massive 3 finger head that slowly settled into a 1/4'" foam with good lacing. The smell was hard to pin down but I didn't like it. Not sure how to describe it but some have called it earthy or woody. I can see that but probably more in the earthy vein - damp mud with rotting vegetation maybe. I thought it would detract from the flavor but it didn't once you get the glass away from your nose but that's half the drink. As it warmed, the alcohol became more pronounced in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel was really good. Overall, I liked Sawtooth and most Left Hand beers but this one missed the mark for me. First I've had of the style so it may be the style.

Taste begins with sweet malt and a bit of fruity nectarine that is quickly overpowered by bitter citrusy hop resins. The alcohol becomes more pronounced towards the end.

A dry toasted malt note, evocative of biscuits dominates the finish and leaves an almost salty rich malty note that lingers on in the finish. A solid herbal character is also here, there is a bit of an astringent side to the hop character. The hops though are fairly muted, like a lightly hopped, supped up amber ale. In the end this beer is just not that well integrated, it is rich and malty, but needs some ample hop character to help balance things out. The finish has a touch too much hot alcohol, which tends to un-balance things a bit more. Still drinkable, and even a bit enjoyable.","Gueuzedude","May 03, 2006"

Plenty of lacing, and the head is pretty quick down to an uneven layer of bubbles. Aroma is a bit hoppy, a bit sweet, but largely boring. Taste is moderately bitter upfront, with ample sweetness kicking in quickly to try to balance. Doesn't quite make it, and the bitterness lingers into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but kind of flat, and drinkability is reasonable. Alcohol is not very apparent in this brew, which could be dangerous. This brew seems to have so much potential in so many areas, I ended up being a bit harsh. But that's the impression I was left with, for better or worse.","ppoitras","Apr 28, 2006"

Malty aroma, slightly woody with tones of cherry and applewood. Mouthfeel is solid and beefy, carbonation is medium -- together they play well. Overall, a big beer and quite sweet beer, deep in flavor but a bit unidimensional and featuring nectarines, slight mincemeat, and candied fruit. Hops lend a slatey underlayer to the finish, though they seem to show up mainly as bitter flavoring hops without much impact on the smell. Alcoholic senses by the end of the glass. Nothing seems wrong with this beer, but it doesn't shine with outstanding notable characteristics either, and its not a very good value in my opinion.","ADR","Apr 02, 2006"

Flavor is nice. Very solid deep caramel and lighter fig and graineyness. A nice peppery hop hits on the finish, playing wilth the alcohol that comes through on the finish. The alcohol is a touch spicey, not hot as I had expected it to be. Feel is moderate with a lack of carbonation. I could use just a hint of bubbles in there to break up the stillness. There is some drying on the side of my tongue on the finish as well. Overall, this one is pretty nice.

Undertone flavors are caramel, fruity esters (melon and pear with a zing), and a dab of molasses. Pretty underwhelming taste. Considering how simple sawtooth is, but the flavors blend so well, I was hoping for much more here. Md-thick body and modest carbonation.","mentor","Beers"

Upon the pour from the 750ml brown bottle, the color a bemused brown with a massive semi-creamy light tan head that slowly erodes leaving a thick and sticky sheet of lace to coat the glass. Nose has a nice bit of hop aroma, also some over ripe fruit, Id say pineapple, all back by a bit of earthiness, start is moderately sweet, the grain profile delightful and the top moderate in feel. Finish is light to medium in carbonation; the hops give a nice spicy kick and the end, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a nice drinking beer, but watch the 9 percent ABV.","Gusler","Mar 16, 2006"

Both times I've noticed a paucity of hops, both in the nose and in taste. There is a whole lot of malt sweetness and a pleasant cereal quality, balanced with an adequate level of bitterness, but it just doesn't have that much going for it.

The body had a full dark orange tint. The nose was good with wisps of toasted malt sort of a caramel sweetness. The taste had a fruit forward approach mixed with a kind of citrus mouth feel. For being 9% it went down smooth, not over powering. Over all a good product.
