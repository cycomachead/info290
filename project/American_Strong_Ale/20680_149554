Taste was quite complex with a burst of cinnamon followed by molasses, vanilla, raisins, chocolate covered cherries, and hint of roast coffee.  Good weight in the mouth, really coating the tongue.   I really enjoyed this beer.  The cinnamon starts off overpowering, but fades and integrates better as it warms.  I think this is an outstanding beer, but I enjoyed the standard B-Bomb a bit more.","OneEye78","Feb 27, 2015"

4.55,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"this is one of the best, and most interesting stouts i have ever had. so much bourbon in this, but its different, not the least bit sweet, mature and highly refined. in the glass it looks incredible. big milkshake head on it, dark dark brown color, tons of viscosity, intimidating and luxurious. the nose is awesome too, i get the coffee and the cinnamon both in equal parts right away. not spicy on the cinnamon, more mellow, very appropriately dosed it seems. there is a nice rich roast to the malt, clearly a combination of roasted barley, chocolate malt, and something in the mid crystal range. the flavor is every bit as good as the nose. cinnamon right up front, but again, not hot, and unlike all the beers that add ancho chili or something like that to these, this one doesnt need it, doesnt miss it, and is better off without it. there is a dark chocolate layer to segue into the coffee side of things. the coffee is great, not bitter at all, and really earthy, bringing the sweetness of the bourbon way way down. there is a brown sugar note in there too, and the wood, which is rustic and intense, so different than any other barrel aged stout ive come across, maybe better than all of them. the cinnamon has a little texture to it, helps it stay dry too, very cool. the finish is a combination of all the flavors, the bourbon and vanilla, the cinnamon, the base beer (which owns by the way) and the coffee, which i think lingers the longest. rich and lathery on the feel, smooth as velvet, and palate coating in an amazing way thats not sweet at all. just so incredible, fremont has me hooked with this one, really one of the best beers i have ever consumed.","StonedTrippin","Feb 24, 2015"

4.61,1.3,4.5,4.75,4.75,4,4.5,"Bottom line: This is a fantastic beer. One I'm proud to know comes from my city. I haven't had the base B-Bomb in a hot minute, so I can't really offer meaningful insights to compare and contrast it to the cinnamon/coffee variation (no, I'm not cracking into the bottles I've got stored away for a beautiful rainy day some years from now just for comparisons sake. At least not today!). If you've ever got the opportunity to drink this (or any of the variants, or the base bomb, or even the base Abominable, really for that matter) do it. Do not think twice. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 (wait, no, if you have the opportunity to snag a couple hundo on the way to drinking this, definitely do that. And then use it to buy more of this!).","kemoarps","Jan 31, 2015"

4.27,-6.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours a very opaque dark brown. Nearly black. Half a finger of light brown head. Sticks to the glass some. Smell initially was straight used coffee grounds. That subsided to make room for some roasted malt, faint cinnamon/nutmeg, a touch of alcohol. Mild oak tannins and some baker's chocolate, too. Flavor is sweet chocolate, some mild roast/coffee, hint of some sweet fruit (cherry?), and a tinge of alcohol. Really nice beer. Mouthfeel is a nice medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. One of the better "winter" beers out there.","jbwimer","Beers"

On tap at the RH, and with some time to sit and contemplate this great beer, it was apparent just what a great beer this is.  The coffee and cinnamon seemed to blend in seamlessly with the base beer and the bourbon, giving the beer a wonderful coffee caramel, toffee nougat and milk dud flavor profile.  To no great surprise, this beer was incredibly popular at the Red Hot.  Even at $10 for an 11.5 ounce pour, they blew through their keg in less than a day.  This is just delicious stuff.","John_M","Dec 13, 2014"
