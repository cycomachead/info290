4.21,-7.7,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Served in my GI tulip at 46 degrees.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a rocky, two-inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks.  Heady eventually settles into a consistent slick leaving swaths and spots of lacing as it recedes.  Nose expresses toffee, caramelized sugar and ethanol.  Taste consistent with nose - the caramel/toffee presence really pops and lingers between quaffs; it's almost sickeningly sweet.  Figs and prunes become evident as the beer starts to warm.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to medium, with a mild, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture.  Overall, quite good but not my favorite blend - best shared amongst 4-6.  A little goes a long way.","Jwale73","Sunday at 07:20 AM"

Pretty much every kind of malty flavor imaginable. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee, fruits and just plain ole sugar. Big and bold but the flavors are fairly well balanced. The sweetness however, is not.","Dope","Apr 01, 2015"

4.73,3.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.25,4.75,"Firestone Anniversaries have always been one of my favorites; each year the brew is full of rich flavors and lovely complexities and it is a pleasure to try and pick out which characteristics came from which of my favorite seasonal and year round Firestone brews. This year did not disappoint. The review is of my third bottle, cellared for 6 months. Pour is pretty standard of this kind of beer, dark and ominous. Light wheat colored tinges seen through light. Smell is pretty interesting: if the beer is still very cold, the first thing I notice is tequila and agave.  As it warms this transforms to smooth coconut and vanilla followed by heavy thick chocolate and coffee. Taste is nothing short of exquisite, delicious brandy filled chocolates melting in your mouth. Lots of different things to focus on and enjoy. Feel is full body, smooth and thick, coats every part of your mouth. Overall one of the greats, can't wait to try another one in a year or so.","Samuel906","Mar 27, 2015"

This anniversary brew pours darker than most I remember from FW. It is a very dark brown. Tan, thin,  oily head. As anticipated, the nose is intense. Like a low rolling nimbus cloud of aroma. The barrel influence is as important as any aspect of the nose. Vanilla, roast, coconut, wood, burnt sugar and caramel. Boozy fig, plum and raisin. Aerated chocolate. The flavor slides right in where the nose left off. Dark fruit layered in roast and some bitter chocolate. Rich caramel, brown sugar candy sugar. A bit of coconut. Intense, yet regal barrel flavor. Not just oak or bourbon; barrel complexity. Finishes with a dense, decadent feel. Medium carbonation. Lots of body. Alcohol is noticeable but works well with all the barrel character. I have come to expect greatness from these FW offerings. No surprise, they have done it again.","VelvetExtract","Jan 10, 2015"

Smells of toffee, dark fruits (maybe raisins or prunes, dark cherries), milk chocolate and roasted malts.  Taste is much the same but with complex oak and bourbon overtones.  Comes to life as it warms up.   More complexity.  Little bourbon burn aftertaste with little to no hoppiness.  Chewy and thicker than I expected.  Very complex but very smooth.

Aroma of bourbon, dark fruit, vanilla, hints of nuts and chocolate, dominated by the bourbon barrel elements, very appealing. Flavor is wonderfully integrated dark dried and fresh fruit, vanilla, oak wood, bourbon, caramel, pale malt, and a hint of grassy hops. Finishes with bourbony dark caramel malt and a hint of molasses. Medium to heavy bodied, nearly syrupy. Complex but balanced, the flavors are well melded.The high ABV shows through even the dense flavor of this, but mostly as bourbon and toffee. Delicious.

Certainly a big beer but surprisingly drinkable and not overly heavy on the palate. Mixing so many different flavors could result in a bit of a mess but FW did such a great job here.

The result tended to be a rather delicious mix--even, at times, a "mess"--of dissimilar and contrasting flavors.  This beer is just like that.  I know that FW, in crafting this beer annually, wants to create something that is "better than the sum of its parts."  It may or may not succeed in this each and every year; but regardless, the mere sum of those parts is exceptional.","Nietzsches_Horse","Dec 01, 2014"
