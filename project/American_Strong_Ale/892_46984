4.25,14.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Aroma: bourbon, malt, vanilla, no hops, Appearance: Dark brown, ¼” head that quickly dissipates. Flavor: rich malt flavors, slight chocolate, caramel, some vanilla with bourbon in the background. A touch sweet but balances the malt and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel: moderate body to moderate full, moderate carbonation. Overall: the bourbon flavor is very well done and the rich malt goes very well with the bourbon barrel aging. The alcohol is there but is not as noticeable as 9.1% alcohol would suggest. It is very smooth and drinkable.","pat61","Mar 15, 2015"

This pours extremely dark with little to no head. Bourbon dominates here with a great malty presence. This separates itself from other strong ales as the alcohol doesn't overwhelm the drink. This would be perfect on a cold day. I will drink it until it gets cold out as a result. Great find","BradMacMullin","Feb 16, 2014"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like molasses, vanilla, dark fruit, oak and chocolate. It tastes like oak/wood, dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and some molasses. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. The bourbon character seems stronger in the aroma as compared to the taste. I liked this brew, but I wish there was a little more of a bourbon kick. Still, for $7.99 a bottle it's certainly worth trying.","bluejacket74","Aug 25, 2013"

It's more chocolate-vanilla smell than wood smell and unusually sweet and ripe in tone, reminding me more of a rail bourbon than a name brand. The flavor is similar to the nose, but at a relatively muted level and somewhat drier compared to the nose. And the malts are somewhat lost in the shuffle at times underneath the bourbon. It's an average sort of beginner's introduction to bourbon beers, but overall it gives off the impression of being raw, unbalanced, and I'm not quite sure that cellaring would fix it given the odd disparity of sweetness between the nose and the flavor.","WastingFreetime","Oct 19, 2012"

Taste of big caramel, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, biscuit, oak, earth, herbal, and light bourbon. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, earth, oak, and light bourbon on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; the bourbon and oak flavors compliment this very nicely without being overpowering. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very nice creamy, thick, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to sip on. Overall this is a damn nice bourbon oak aged ale.

Rather sweet for my taste, but still not bad.

The nose is faint alcohol (that gets hotter as it warms), coffee, oak, aluminum (also much more pronounced when warm), and caramel wood sugar. The taste brings forward more of the yeast's fruitiness, which i expected to find in nose. There is some subtle roastiness in the beer's finish that dries out the beer's semi-sweet, medium body.The bourbon/wood doesn't carry through to the beer's taste as I would have preferred, but it's very smooth and drinkable nonetheless. Although this beer is labeled as a strong ale I would have compared it to a strong porter or stout instead. The lacking yeast character/full-bodied sweetness brings this beer down to being slightly better than average, despite its drinkability.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 03, 2012"

Flavor fades rather quickly, but leaves a pleasant oaky sweet malt aftertaste. A slight astringency to the finish that was not great, but was moderated by the other flavors. Medium bodied not quite reaching creaminess. With more intensity of flavor could compete with the top tier oak aged strong ales. Reaches for the ring, but misses. On the other hand, the flavor is light but complex and well integrated. I enjoyed this strong ale and will buy it again.","LiquidAmber","May 16, 2012"

Pours a solid dark brown/black with a thinnish tan head that dissipates almost instantly. Smells of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, earthy and woody. This is listed as a strong ale, the website describes this as an Imperial Stout, it smells like a cross between a Belgian dark strong and a porter. There isn't much roast in the aroma or in the taste for that matter. Taste is sweet and malty with dark sugars and fruits dominating the taste. Slight alcohol and earthy hop in there as well. Bit of a roasted grain ash in the finish. Medium body and level of carbonation, with a slick watery mouthfeel. Decent brew, but really nothing special here.

3.87,4.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good American Strong Ale. Most beers with the word bourbon in their name have a pretty dominating bourbon aspect to them, this one didn't and I thought that worked well with this brew. The lightness of the bourbon must be because it was aged on bourbon oak chips instead of being aged in the barrel, it seems like by using the chips you have more control on how bourbony the beer will be instead of just throwing it in the barrel and praying for the best. The nicely blended bourbon aspect of this beer would make this a great beer to introduce people to bourbon beers, it gives you a taste of the bourbon but it doesn't hit you over the head with bourbon and that can be too much for people who aren't used to it. What I liked most about this beer was it's balance and how nicely blended the flavors were, what I liked least about this beer was it's lack of carbonation, it was pretty close to being flat. I would buy this beer again, it has a good price point compared to the other bourbon beesr and it would make a good go to bourbon beer. If bourbon beers are your thing, give it a try, its nice to have something other then a stout that has the bourbon treatment, and if your are wanting to get into bourbon beers this is a pretty good place to start. This was a good first impression for Cold Spring Brewing Company, before this beer this brewery wasn't even on my radar but now that I have tried it I will be on the look out for other beers from them, good job guys thanks for making a nice Strong Ale with bourbon flavors and not a bourbon bomb.","StoutHunter","Jul 16, 2011"

Usually when breweries are so bold as to market a beer as aged in bourbon barrels, it comes off as something a bit more intense, like a Bourbon County of a Kentucky Breakfast. Maybe the fine details are in the statement "aged ON Bourbon Oak Chips" and not specifically "bourbon barrels". Either way, the beer is still very nuanced and has a great body to it. In fact, I might recommend it over some of the other beers, as this may be much more palatable than the rest to someone who's never tried such a style before.","techfed87","Jul 11, 2011"

The smell is bready and brown sugary. The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy--very nice! The taste is also brown sugar or molasses up front (though this makes it sound very sweet, it's not--how do you describe the non-sweet aspects of brown sugar and molasses? caramel?). This is a very interesting flavor. It's pretty complex. It's categorized as an American Strong Ale. It has similarities to Brown Ales. It isn't nearly as bitter as the other Strong Ales I've had. The beer is aged on bourbon oak chips. The oak is present though understated (which is fine by me). The bourbon is clearly noticeable. I would guess that the wood contributes to the soft mouthfeel. This is quite a nice beer.","PhiloPsych","0"
