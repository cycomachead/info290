A spicy, burning boozines gets calmed by sweet malts and hints of vanilla, while the wooden oak notes settle down on the back of the palate. Has a high, sparkling carbonation, which pushes malt sweetness on a detectable level during the finish, with warming, wooden alcoholic hints in the background.","aleigator","Aug 20, 2014"

Working through that some thick caramel, prune, ripe apple, coarse wood, toffee, and a dusting of coffee grounds. More booze on the finish, huge whiskey note. Much more like a massive English barleywine than any type of brown ale. Carbonation is low, even taking style into consideration. Lots of flavors going on, the booziness is a little much even for a 13% barrel aged beer. I wish I had another one of these to try in a year.","bump8628","Beers"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and whiskey aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and whiskey flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of a woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.
