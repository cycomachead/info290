We were presented with a beautiful beer in coloring, and in foam, but the following taste after the invitation was robust, and as hoppy as advertised. The bitterness from the hops really dominated the finish, and you’re left with quite a different flavoring than you start with, which keeps the drinker guessing. The nose was comparatively weak, but everything else was exciting, and decidedly tasty.","TheBrewo","Nov 04, 2012"

Intense caramel malt and citrus hop aromas along with a buttery nut aroma. Thick, syrupy feel with light, lazy carbonation. Floral and citrus hop flavors up front that slowly fade from beginning to end with a solid, sticky sweet caramel malt backbone.

The nose carries a good amount of brown sugar plus a nice bit of citrus. Smelling this, I thought this was an ESB. Maybe so, just a very strong one. Probably more properly classified as an English Strong Ale. Flavor brings a slight bit of diacetyl and some malty sweetness. Moderate fruitiness.

The Wench is a bit rough around the edges but makes for a fun one night stand. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel is not necessarily smooth and creamy, but it is certainly full.

I would not mind my DIPA's smelling and tasting like this but I know I am in the minority. Nicely balanced flavor as well. Caramel malt, and buttery yeast gives way to bitter citrus and pine hops.

Not exactly "screaming" with hops as the label would suggest. Taste follows the nose with bready malt with a hint of caramel sweetness. Followed by a nice floral hop bitterness.

Has a thick cream colored head that goes away pretty quickly and not nearly as much lacing as I expected. The smell was a little different than I expected, but excellent. It didn't smell as hoppy as I expected but it was clearly present, then it had a nice sweet smell to it, almost like a brown sugar. The taste didn't quite live up to the smell, maybe it was the hype of the smell I just created. There was a citrus hop to it with some caramelized malt. Both the mouthfeel and drinkability was good, no alcohol bite at all.

Sweet malty caramel aroma with a noticable alcohol presence. Smells a bit smokey and get a sense of some vanilla in there. The first sip was kind of harsh on a clean palate. A real malty sweetness to it with plenty of hops. Again, the alcohol is there. A touch of bitterness, but not too much. Becomes increasingly easy to drink with each sip and quite enjoyable.

There is very astringent and bitter hoppiness, there is also a cloying almond-vanilla extract like unpleasant taste to the beer. Some reviewers commented upon the ringwood yeast used. Perhaps this gives the beer the phenolic weirdness that I couldn't get beyond. There is plenty of crystallized caramel maltiness to this beer throughout.

Visibly effervescent, the head is kept alive from beneath. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in it's wake. A bit more head and lace as things warm up, some 3D. This girl screams citrus grapefruit hop when you pop her cap. The smell is unbalanced towards the hops, but under that i get a toasted lager-like malty note. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied with a lighter texture that lends a bit to her drinkability. Full flavored, the hop and toasted malt taste combination is a winner.

4.15,5.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Served at cellar temperature, in a pint glass, from a twenty-two ounce bottle. Pours a deep ruby amber color, that is quite dark. A somewhat vigorous pour yields a bubbly, soapy yet pillowy, beige colored head. Great head retention leaves thick rings of lace all the way down the glass. Great nose on this beer as well. Tons of hops hit the nose first, and then a quick rush of sweet malt. Huge plum and raisin aromas followed by a touch of oak, alcohol, and yeast. Aromas compliment eachother nicely. Taste is sugary sweet with a bitter hit of hops. Hops are knocked down a peg by a thick maltiness that lends the sweetness a hand. More of the dark dried fruits that were noted in the nose, show up in the flavor. Just a bit of the oakiness shows up as well. Alcohol is pretty well hidden but is there. Finishes very smooth with a decent amount of carbonation felt on the tongue and throat. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel is just a tad syrupy. Coats the mouth nicely. Pretty good drinkability here. This one deserves a 5 for the artwork alone.","jaxon53","Jan 20, 2008"

Currently on tap in a 5 gallon keg at home in my kegerator. Pours a gorgeous ruby color with hints of amber, very clear. Thick off-white head with lots of lacing. Aroma is intensely citrusy, again a combination of the hops (largely centenial I believe) and the ringwood yeast used at this brewery. Gentle round malt sweet in the beginning with an oily finish.

Pine rosin, grapefruit rind, and herbal bitterness obscures most of the malt and alcohol sweetness. A bit of heat can be felt, but that's about it. Nice if you like hop juice, but really one-dimensional. Mouthfeel is a bit thick as expected. Drinkability is great for hop\heads. Not really a session beer or one that I'd even come close to calling "quaffable", but enjoyable none the less.

Middles Ages offers this in bombers and on tap for growler fills but not in 12 oz. bottles. So far it's always been on tap at the brewery, whether it be for tastings or in the back room for fills. Definitely one of my favorite brews of all time, but if you're not much into hops I would avoid it. Drinkability is rough unless you enjoy a lot of hops and 8% ABV.

The flavors on display here also defy easy categorization and they aren't necessarily pleasant.

Tart and slightly dry in the finish with a citrus rind sharpness pulling at the margins. There is a slight mustiness underneath which works to balance the bright hop finish. No hint of the 8% alcohol. There is a long and lingering sweet citrus finish. Full bodied with a slightly heavy mouthfeel, the fine carbonation works to lift the weight.

Nose of toffee and butterscotch backbone. Big sappy, yet floral hops. Bitter and numbing, but with some alcohol. Taste is sweet and rich toffee malt up front. Quickly gives way to big hops: pine pitch, sap, resin, yum. Tongue gets numb as hop bitterness stabs crazily. Complex, warming rummy alcohol leads an otherwise, mostly bitter (sappy) finish.

The taste is rich and viscous, coating the mouth with a sweet maltiness, then offset by the onslaught of hops bringing this brew into balance in a big way. The moderately roasted malts par well with the hops selected to create this brew and a nice stickiness is in attendance finishing short of sweet; ample hopping keeping this well balanced. The mouthfeel is nicely oily and smooth, rich and bold; hops again keep all elements in check. The taste of this great brew lasts for several minutes; drinkability is very good considering the concentration and volume of this beer.

4.23,7.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"22 oz. bomber. Dark, overbrewed tea appearance with minimal, dense head. Aromas are of pine and citrus hops with that familiar Ringwood yeast Middle Ages loves to use. Initially very bitter, with a heavy mineral flavor -- almost overwhelming -- with some roasty coffee malt at the very tail end. Hops predominate with bitter, bitter grapefruit which all but entirely cloaks a bready malt structure. The mouthfeel is full and chewy. Alcohol (8%) is barely perceptible underneath all those massive flavors. This is a big beer, probably the most complex offering I've sampled from Middle Ages. Interesting in that I mostly detect the Ringwood in the nose and in the otherwise hoppy burps. Drinkability...not sure yet. I think I'll wait a while before picking up another, but this certainly has piqued my interest, and I'll have no problem finishing the bottle.","orfeu","Nov 07, 2005"

The beer is quite light on the palate, at least from what I was expecting. There is a light sweetness to this beer, which off-plays the sharp pine-notes, grapefruit, and tangerine. The diacetyl definitely is quite present in the taste, it especially lingers a long time in the finish. This is like chewing on a butter soaked mix of pine and citrus. I can't say that it is without merit though; the ample hop rate does help to mitigate the diacetyl dominance, except perhaps in the finish. This beer is quite a conundrum, at times I find it drinkable, yet at others I want to pour it down the sink. Thus the score neither captures the depths or the heights that this beer gets to.","Gueuzedude","Oct 18, 2005"
4.08,3.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Flavors run the gamut. Initially sweet balanced by a thick, burnt malt profile. Hardcore grapefruit juice flavor; a bit like drinking malty, boozy grapefruit juice. Okay not really, but you get the idea. Rounded bitterness in the finish. I remember the cask version being much hoppier.

Perhaps it is personal taste, but I like a DIPA to be a step between IPA and Barleywine family (juicier & fruitier than IPA, but not all the way to a thick sipping beer like barleywine). I cant argue that it is a highly hopped beer, it just lacks any inspiration of artistry in its construction. There is no complexity to its flavors and it lacks that juicy, hoppy chewiness that I love oh so much. I would call this average at best, and for the same price I can enjoy beautiful examples of the style like Maharaja, Big A, and Hercules.

Dark, almost oaky, smell. Intriguing. Tastes unlike any other IPA I've ever had. Hops are light compared to most IPAs. They taste mostly piney with some citrus character. Bitter is gentle, but seems more because of an acrid sting from carbonation and a sour tang. What's that sour tang?...it's caramelly, but it's as if the caramel was left in the sun and spoiled in some way. Maybe like the sugar and oils separated. Butterscotch, bordering on flat out butter. A little bit mediciney. Wet sugary sweet finish with an underlying grassy co-humulone hop roughness. This beer is balanced mostly toward the malt, but the hop flavor and bitter are noticable and keep the beer interesting. Md body but slick and buttery in the mouth.

The taste is sweet caramel and buttery up front, with some very strong bittering hops in the finish. The wine from the smell is completely gone. Alcohol and medicinal aspect is very noticeable, which knocks it down a couple notches. The mouthfeel stands out in this beer - it has that nice smooth creaminess that I look for in a Double IPA.

Brew was poured to a amber color, had pretty good clarity and a nice sized tan/white head that had good retention. The aromas seem to be similar to the bottled offering. Definite hop aromas, more pine than citrus but they are both there. Over all it is a real nice aromatic brew. The brew has a dominant hop taste that really comes out about midway through and leaves a hop feel on your tongue for a while. Can notice some malt like characteristics but it seems to come and go quickly once the hop taste hits. Over all it is very good, but think I liked the bottled version a bit more.

A fluffy off white head foams up 1 cm and floats effortlessly on the surface. The head fades gradually to a thin surface layer that remains throughout sampling. Aroma is a complex mix of hops: pine, grass, and mostly grapefruity citrus scents. The first sip reveals a creamy texture and fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is briefly toffee and some dark fruit (plums) but this is quickly overwhelmed by piney and grapefruit hops. Now the hops are strong, but not burn your tongue strong, so dont expect it.

It's almost a standard brown/amber color. Has a tall head that has good retention and leaves a nice amount of lacing behind on the glass. Huge aroma. The aroma is very mostly a grapefruity hop aroma, but there is a bit of malt hiding back there too. The flavor is not nearly as hoppy strong as the aroma would suggest. It's surprisingly well balanced as the malty goodness was hiding in the aroma, but it's right there in the flavor. The hop flavor adds a citrus/grapefruit feel to things and it finishes strong. Very well made. Drinkability is great for a Double IPA. Mouthfeel is right where it should be. No trace of the 9% alcohol.","clvand0","Jan 28, 2005"

Tons of sweet grapefruit but with a very big malt sweetness as well. Wow, this smells great. The flavor is not as big as the nose. The malt is actually a little bigger than the hop, and the hop comes through as more of a spicey and sweet than just the strait up citric grapefruit. I like it. Its a sweet, malty beer but also a nice hoppy beer. I find it balanced. The feel is moderate to thick, very smooth. This is a damn nice beer. No hint of the 9% ABV anywhere at all in this one.

4.52,14.4,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Anyway. Strange color for an IPA: red-brown with a thin, tan head. An amazing combination of floral and fruit notes in the nose and flavor--cherry, banana, grapefruit, strawberry, mango are the strongest, in that order. Pretty even-handed, in that the taste matches the scents. Smells a bit more hoppy-sweet, tastes more hoppy-bitter, but that's almost it. Excellent balance. I can see some pine and citrus now, an enjoyable fall-leaf flavor (and almost texture!) Smells delicious and backs it up. The bitters are fantastic, very smooth and manage to be biting without being harsh. I think the malt is muted (as it should be for the style), but it's a theory that the smoothness of the brew comes from malt. A very very good example of the style, definitely meant to be savored, and ideal in a larger-than-12oz serving.","cooter","Jan 20, 2005"
3.58,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Sampled on 1/14/05 from a 22 oz buxom bomber bottle courtesy of slander. Pours out extremely dark amber with a tall tan head. The only Double IPA I can remember being this dark or darker was Gordon. Decent lacing and head retention on this one. Strong citric hoppiness with an almost equally strong sweet maltiness fills the aroma. There is an odd aroma I cant quite place that is pretty strong, Ringwood maybe? Flavor started a bit bitter with hops and somewhat buttery. The odd aroma seemed to be in the flavor as well which makes it a bit interesting. A good amount of malty sweetness is present too. The hoppiness seems a bit too muted for the style, while its there and pleasant its not quite the kick I would hope for. Mouthfeel is and medium with a slight bitter prickliness. Drinkability was ok as well. A pretty solid beer all around but not my cup of tea for a double IPA.","meathookjones","Jan 20, 2005"
4,1.3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This one is a very dark ruby with a sizeable khaki milk foam of a head. Really gorgeous this one. The aroma is heavily perfumed with lemon pepper and grass hops that tingle the nose. Beneath that is a warm maltiness mingling with alcohol and that butterscotch house character of Middle Ages. The flavor is sweet, but not cloying, balanced by a good bitterness from the hops. I dont know if Id call it a Double IPA, but its a very good American Strong Ale.","aracauna","Jan 19, 2005"
4.09,3.5,4,5,3.5,4.5,4,"While style appropriate, the taste is a bit bitter for my liking. A roasted astringency helps round out the bitterness and make it unique. Impressions of scorched sugar and creamy, frothy egg whites in the flavor and mouthfeel make this beer more interesting than others in its style that I've had. Surprisingly drinkable for something this bitter.","marburg","Jan 12, 2005"
4.37,10.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"OK, no sweet citrusy hops in the mouth. Well, maybe a little. But mostly this is just powerful bitingly bitter hops. The malt comes in late with some smoky caramel maltiness to provide a bit of balance. But really, who are we kidding? This is a tribute to hops and the hops shine though beautifully. Not that balanced really. A bitter hops aftertaste that lingers forever. I can lick my cheeks and still get the oily hops off with my tongue. Pretty drinkable if you like the hops. Right up there with Ruination IMFO.","ViveLaChouffe","Jan 12, 2005"
4.33,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark chestnut with a very impressive rocky and creamy tan head that persists steadfastly throughout the drink and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The smell starts with potent, fragrant, and fresh hops blended with plenty of balancing grainy and slightly toasted malts. Flavors start with a strong, but not overwhelming, hop kick. The hops are quickly and nicely balanced by strong toasty malts, yeastiness, and slight fruitiness, however. A masterful blend of hop and malts in my opinion. Mouth-feel is a touch heavy for an IPA, but the brew remains extremely drinkable due to it's well-balanced and refreshing flavors. I could easily have consumed the whole 750 ml bottle before noticing the strength of this excellent double IPA.","dgallina","Jan 11, 2005"
3.67,-7.1,4,4.5,3,3.5,4,"Mouth feel is decent, somewhere in between thin and medium, not oily typical of many I2PAs. Flavor lingers for a bit. Drinkability is decent as well due to the balanced nature.","blitz134","Jan 03, 2005"
4.38,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to my mother in law bringing down some NY beers from Buffalo just in time for the Rose Bowl,anyways what a pour deep amber with a huge fluffy head that takes its time to settle leaving globs of lace.Aromas of citrius,pine and some butteriness in there,pretty well rounded.Big citruisy hop flavor up front but there is some great balance with a lightly sweet maltiness that kicks in late to make this a hop accented brew with a huge maltiness that almost keeps up.Mouthfeel is very creamy and how drinkable for 9% I have it nearly gone in less than ten minutes.I have been drinking a few west coast IPA's and hop tilted brews and this east coaster is the best in my opinion.","oberon","Jan 01, 2005"
3.65,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a tough beer to call. I like the idea of lots of hops and ringwood, but there was something that kept it from being truly great.","Southernbrew","Dec 13, 2004"
4.06,2.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1 1/2" creamy dark tan head, which laces nicely. A deeply orange-copper hued brew, with slightly buttery hoppy aroma, with ample malt sweetness. Taste is Ringwood and sweet malts, with hoppy notes, but not "screaming," which is what the bottles says. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent for the style, would advise trying. However, if you have a big Ringwood aversion, and don't plan on giving this a chance, don't waste your money.","ppoitras","Dec 12, 2004"
3.98,0.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A little disappointing considering how far from the extreme bleeding edge this double IPA stands. A conservative and approachable East Coast take on the style.","rajendra82","Dec 10, 2004"
4.08,3.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Bomber bottle, no freshness dating to be found. Pours a heady shade of dark auburn, quite clear, raising a tan head. This leaves a lot of stringy lace as well as sheets of lacing. Sweat, malty and resiny nose. So far so good! medium bodied. Creamy, buttery mouthfeel. Notes of vanilla, maple, leather, just a wee bit thin on the malt, but comes through with a resiny, pine finish. Strong, flavorful, complex and well crafted ale. Well worth seeking out.","Billolick","Nov 30, 2004"
4.54,14.9,4,5,4.5,4,4.5," The aroma on this beer is indeed screaming with hops as loud as it can, it reeks of fresh juicy hops, and it has a lot more to offer too. Nice caramel and plum in the nose along with the dripping pine sap and citrus. Body is best described as medium bordering on the low end of strong ale heavy, perfect carbonation. Taste is a whirlwind of hop flavors, like a juicy navel orange soaked in spruce sap. Then something remarkable happens as the flavor makes a smooth but very definite transition to a sweet, fruit and nut bread malty middle. Finish wrapped up clean and dry as can be, just bitter enough to make you grab for the glass again as quick as your reflexes allow. Superbly crafted beer this one, eminently drinkable, I can only imagine the wonder it would be on tap.","mikeys01","Nov 28, 2004"
4.42,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a very good Double/Imperial IPA from my fine friends at MA. This brew is dark amber/red/brown with a nice head of khaki foam. The aromas are of heavy, caramel malts, ringwood yeast notes, HOPS, fresh baked breads, and more. The taste is very malty and hoppy in a nice unison. The hops hit hard up front, but the malt backbone is very, very strong as well with a very pronounced biscuit flavor in the mix. The finish is leafy, and raw, ie: awesome. The mouthfeel is quite thick, but not OTT and the drinkability is very good. An interesting, and quite awesome Double IPA with that distinctive ringwood fruitiness blending perfectly with those distinctive PACNW hops.","francisweizen","Nov 25, 2004"
4.27,8.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Anyway, moving on- The beer is of a high quality indeed. I was very impressed. It was a dark amber colour, almost like very weak, watered-down coffee actually. Darker than I'm used to for an IPA. It had a good sized fluffy slightly off-white head that didn't last too too long. It smelled like a big hop festival, almost stinging my nose. Also it smelled a bit bready maybe actually.. yes. Tasted oh so good, the hops were very much there, but not in your face. It was as though I was drinking a buttery dinner roll along with a side of fresh green hops. No real trace of the alcohol, and I know it's definitely in there.. Very very tasty. Mouthfeel was very slippery and soft swirling about my tongue and sliding down my throat. Drinkability is high- very drinkable, but this wench of a beer would whip your ass if left alone in the room with you, so you better watch out with her.","erica","Nov 23, 2004"

4.35,10.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"pours a nice dark amber colour with a moderate light tan head on top. this has to be one of the darkest ipa's (double or otherwise) that i can recall seeing. very nice. the smell is of hops galore. there are earth/dirt scents scattered throughout and a hop sweetness that is present as well. nice and strong without overpowering. reminds me of the scent of an old baseball glove. the flavour starts off nice and sweet and is quickly attacked by hops from every angle. there's a dirty earth/roasted malt finish that's dry and tasty. sweet hop burps with some pine needle notes come out shortly thereafter. some have noted caramel. i didn't catch it at all in the flavour or the smell. oh, well. it's still damn good. this one's @ 9% abv so be careful, as the alcohol is not noticeable at all in the flavour. i'd definitely try this one again. a nice first offering from middle ages for me.","SixpointJMH","Aug 28, 2004"

4.13,4.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick off-white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice malty scent surrounded by an intense floral hop arrangement. The Ringwood yeast adds a fruity aroma that helps balance the malts and hops. The taste is good. It is rich in malt complexity and piney hop flavor. It is really bitter, but finishes strong and goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well. It has tremendous flavor and complexity. I love this brew!","WesWes","Mar 22, 2004"
4.48,13.4,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"Man, when does the hop worship ever stop? This was a rough assault on the palate. Malty sweetness in the background, but the overpowering aroma and taste was pure hop goodness. Color was reddish in a dark bar, but very very attractive. The taste was hoppy, and slightly astringent and roasty, but ultimately, with a big, bold hop flavor. Great mouthfeel, as the taste just takes over your mouth and coats it. I would probably end the night on this one (as I did last night), because the intensity of the hops and the high abv leave one with such a warm feeling.","twilight","Feb 14, 2004"

3.93,-0.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a deep chestnut color with currant red around the edges and a tan head. Smell was very hoppy and definitely the resinous, pine cone hop variety. Tons of forest pine smell and just a hint of malts streaking the back of the nose. Taste was a hop heads wet dream. So much hops I couldn't even fathom it. These were not the citrus variety. Straight pine. There was considerable malt backbone as well especially as it warmed. Tons of esters towards the bottom fo the glass as it took on some more doughy and malt driven flavors. The carbonations was a little much at the beginning but as it warmed up it settled down a bit. Wailing Wench was a pretty good beer, but I think it could do with a bit of mellowing and melding as the flavors were very distinct and did not act together. It was hops at the beginning and malts at the end. A little more togetherness would make this beer a lot better. Also a warning, the amount of hops destroyed my pallete so don't plan on tasting anything for another 2 hours.","GreatPondBrewer","Nov 20, 2003"

4.03,2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Backwash: I had been anticipating trying this beer for more than a week, when I finally got to try it. Maybe nothing could overcome such anticipation. It reminded me a bit of a bigger version of the DFH 60 Minute (and no, I dont think thats the 90 Minute) with a slight diacetyl note. It seemed thin and a bit unbalanced. In its defense, it was also very green, which may have affected its drinkability. For those hopfiends out there, this may be perfect for you. It was the hoppiest beer Ive ever had, and a bit too extreme for me. I look forward to giving this another try.","Dantes","Oct 29, 2003"

4.32,9.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a growler 6 hours after it was filled, right into a Middle Ages pint glass. It reaks of hops and I love it!!! There's a little citrus hop aroma mixed in with the normal Middle Ages yeast smell (Ringwood). It poured a nice dark tan head that soon became one with the beer. She's a pretty dark Imperial IPA, deep mahogany in color. It's all hops baby (best Dick Vitel impresion). The hop bitterness hits your tongue quickly but stops just short of going overboard. There's a certain sweetness to the hops which I'm guessing comes from the combined taste of the Ringwood yeast and the barley used. Definitely a quality IIPA, gonna have to try this one on cask. I bet it would be even better after a short aging. Ah, what the hell do I know:-)","HappyHourHero","Oct 22, 2003"
