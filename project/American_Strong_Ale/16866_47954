Appearance is dark reddish-brown with a tan head, streaks, and minimal lacing, which is not unexpected for such a high abv beer. Aroma is powerful butterscotch, vanilla, toffee, cocoa, bourbon heat, roasted malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and oak. Taste is very sweet with toffee, vanilla, and fig up front. Some oaky bitterness, but not balanced whatsoever. And heat, but less than the 15% on the bottle prepared me for. A sipper, certainly, due to both booze and sweetness. Full bodied, thick, slightly oily texture, low carbonation, sweet, warming finish.","SierraFlight","Beers"

It's easily one of the best blended ales I've had the opportunity to sample, and I only wish I had tried to grab another bottle of it.","LambicPentameter","Jul 10, 2014"

Booze hits right up front with a strong alcohol burn. Tastes like Licorice, toffee, vanilla, caramel, oak, bourbon, cola. Just so many flavors. Much like the other big bruery beers I've had the mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, but it's good for this being an almost 17 perfect beer. Makes it easyish to drink. Some nice carbonation. The aftertaste lingers for a while, booze and a nice combo of the all the flavors. Very impressive beer.","Mikeypnh","Apr 22, 2014"

4.76,7.4,3.75,4.5,5,5,4.75,"Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! Dark mahogany pour with a two finger beige head that faded quickly with minimal lacing. Huge oak and dark fruit notes in the nose along with hints of vanilla, toffee, leather, tobacco, and molasses. The taste is really complex and mirrors the nose with tons of wood and dark fruit along with hints of vanilla, maple, coconut, bourbon, tobacco, prunes, figs, raisins, caramel, molasses, and toffee. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth with almost no alcohol burn, which is crazy for a 15% ABV beer. The carbonation was on the low side, but it really suited this beer. Overall, this was a huge, flavorful, and extremely drinkable beer. It leans to the sweet side, but it's far from cloying. This drinks and tastes more like a Barley Wine for me. However you classify it, it's an incredible beer that I'm glad I was able to taste!","beerdrifter","Feb 07, 2014"

The blending of three different beers in this "black & tan" seemed to lend a number of interesting characteristics to this brew. The folks at The Bruery really do know how to make consistently excellent high ABV beers better than anyone else.","Damian","Jan 10, 2014"

A lot of sweetness in the nose, fruit and sugars, notes of burnt caramel, black cherry, with a decent vanilla component, woody, though not overly boozy. Taste of dark sugars--brown sugar, caramel--sweet and artificially fruity, cherry cough syrup, rum raisin, notes of vanilla, slight coconut, pretty thick with booze. Kind of messy, and though while there was some heat, it didn't nearly feel like a 15% beer. Body was medium, mouthfeel was slick. A decent offering.","Rifugium","Nov 14, 2013"

4.2,-5.2,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"pretty wild beer here, their version of a black and tan, what a gas! the color is red and caramel mixed together, very thick like sludge, dense, minimal but lasting light brown head. I smell everything, no joke. rich malts, darker grains than the color shows, aggressive sugars, whiskey barrel, vanilla, clove, rye malt, booze, and molasses. what I don't smell or taste in this, is yeast. it is mysteriously absent from the flavor profile, not that this beer is hurting for complexity, this is a hell of a blend. dried fruit and sugar, as well as the best richest elements of black Tuesday are what I taste here. its oaky and rich, almost too much really, but the booze is not that obvious for something so high. this goes way beyond beer to something else entirely, more of a barleywine than anything, just so much happening, and such a heavy buzz from even small quantities of this. good carbonation for the size, and about all the body you can pack in. this is not my favorite beer from the bruery, but it is yet another example of their expertise in all aspects of beer making. a blend like no other, worth trying for lovers of huge brews and the bruery more generally.","StonedTrippin","Oct 04, 2013"

3.2,-27.8,4,2.75,3.25,3,3.5,"This is definitely a HOT beer, at this alcohol level that is not unexpected, but I can’t say that I necessarily appreciate that either. The sweetness is also a bit too simplistic in this beer; I would have been more appreciative if the malt character was less simple sugar focused and had more of a dense, almost savory, concentrated malt character. Interestingly enough, given how hot this beer is, I don’t get as much Bourbon character as I was expecting; more of the vanillin, spicy oak, and toasted oak come out individually rather than reminiscent of actual Bourbon. Not a bad beer if you are only having a couple ounces as a nightcap, but anything more for me is just a bit underwhelming (not complex enough in flavor) and overwhelming (in the hot alcohol and sugary sweetness) at the same time. I must say that I really like the oxidized malt character / sherry notes that are on display here (is this the anniversary old ale contribution), it really adds an extra dimension that keeps me much more interested than I otherwise would be. Drinkable and even enjoyable in small amounts if I am not critically evaluating the beer. Before cracking this beer, I had not reallized how strong it was going to be, I wish I had, as I would have planned to use the rest of the beer for cooking of some sort; I could imagine this being used quite well in a “rum” cake recipe, or even a dense fruit cake would likely be a perfect use (just make sure to reduce the level of sugar called out for in the recipe to account). I am planning on this already with the bottle of Black Tuesday that I am opening; in fact I am almost more excited about the Imperial chocolate stout cake that I am going to make than actually drinking the beer :-).","Gueuzedude","Sep 28, 2013"

The taste has amazing brown sugar sweetness, bourbon, white oak, cherries, fig, plum, melons. The most amazing thing is there is not a trace of booze anywhere in this beer which is simply stunning considering the staggering 15.5% ABV.

Huge sweet notes from the bourbon and from the heavy malts of all the blends. One of the biggest, nastiest black and tans I've ever laid eyes on. Given the blend, more like a black and ...dark brown. And dark brown. This one is a sipper, given the sweetness, the heaviness and the ABV. Packaging this in a 750ml seems ludicrous to me, but I will do my best to soldier through it.","Dope","Jun 06, 2013"

Taste is a mix between bourbon and vanilla notes with some oak, dark fruit and some vinous notes which feels more or less balanced with the rest of the mix.

The smell of bourbon and oak hit my nostrils as soon as I pop the cap off the top. Upon closer inspection I am greeted with light and brown sugars with a fair amount of dark pitted fruit and a hint of ethanol. the flavor is sweet up front with brown and syrupy sugar. Dark and light fruit come next along with a bit of vanilla and wood. The alcohol and bourbon come in next with a ferocity that won't quit. Long lingering tannic wood and alcohol burn long after the sweet liquid settles to the bottom floor. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet harsh alcoholic mouthfeel. Nice sipper, but there is no denying the alcohol content of this one.

4.49,1.4,3,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Melange #3 pours black, but not quite as deep as, say, an imperial stou. About two fingers of light tan foam come together to form the head. Retention is just average, and lacing is basically nonexistent. The nose is heavy on caramel and bourbon, with some nice, subtle vanilla and oak undertones. The taste really steps things up and has more layers of complexity. The bourbon takes a little bit more of a backseat here, as vanilla, caramel, and milk chocolate form the centerpiece of the flavor profile. Bourbon and wood come in and lend supporting roles. The touch that really adds the final touch is the hint of figs and cherries that creep in during the finish. The body is full and creamy, though not nearly as syrupy as I might have anticipated a 15% beer being. The carbonation is barely there, just enough to make itself known. Melange #3 is a delicious beer from The Bruery, and one that shows the possibilities of artfully blending beer.","axeman9182","Mar 25, 2012"
4.33,-2.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Melange is not black, rather deep, deep brown, with dark red auburn highlights. A decent off tan/light tan head sits atop the ale, it actually never fades completely from sight. Smells strongly of alcohol, hot alcohol, but barrel too, caramel, toffee, lots of vanilla and chocolate. Coconut too! Really fine smelling beer as I love bourbon bombs. The taste too is great, toasted marshmellow, caramalized brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, yes bourbon too. You do get a touch of alcohol in the flavor. Thick and heavy mouthfeel, almost oily and slightly cloying....though what would you expect? Super tasty ale here.","pmlondrigan","Mar 21, 2012"

For the cost of a couple bottles I could grab a case of Rochefort 10. Don't get me wrong...it's very good but just not on the same level as some of the Firestone Walker blends I've had. I would definitely drink this brew anytime it was put in front of me and I am very glad I had the opportunity to try it. Just wish it wasn't so damn expensive.

It drinks medium in body and is very sticky and leaves a great amount of residual sugar around the glass. Overall its hard to endorse this one. It's too big for its own good, just too much sweet malt. Not worth the money in my opinion.","aasher","0"

Candied sugar and bourbon. Taste is quite boozy throughout the whole experience, yet its flavors remain nicely balanced and smooth. Great cherry and vanilla oak flavors. Lovely chocolate and malt flavors from the Black Tuesday. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and boozy. Drinkability is fairly high for such a huge beer.

Immediately after is the remarkable sweetness that this beer has.The Papier/Coton contribution is most noticeable with the big bourbon along with the brown sugar and vanilla making this rather decadent. The BT adds a layer of cocoa and chocolate to the palate. And then, there's the raisin and grape character that lends a definite brandy note to the palate. The toffee character does lend a lightness to the palate, a mild boozy beer. Medium-full in body with soft carbonation, this beer has a boozy finish with a blend of bourbon, brandy and brown sugar. Excellent stuff, though I have to admit that it will take me 3 nights to finish this damn bottle.","DefenCorps","Mar 23, 2011"

The taste to me is heavy on the Black Tuesday, either that of those flavors just dominate the whole thing. The blending works though and I am enjoying this. What I would say is that on a day like this, trying so many great beers, this one sort of gets lost in the mix and doesn't stand out for me. I'll have to try it again on its own and re-rate I think.

Hints of tart dark cherry, plum, raisin, fig mixed with silky chocolate malt and caramel. Very well balanced and pretty drinkable considering the ABV. You can taste the heat butni wouldn't have guessed this beer was 17%. I'm actually very surprised that after the initial palate shock is beer is very smooth and flavorful.

There's plenty of carbonation to prevent this from coming off as syrupy. Really good stuff - I had 3 glasses of it - but it was tough to finish that third glass given the high ABV and sugar level.

I also pick up a lot caramel and other overly ripe dark fruits. Very interesting. This one is warm going down. Tastes of same smell notes. A little booze sits on the finish. Smooth going down with perfect carbonation on the finish. There is a big sweetness to the taste like fruit compote that you notice right away. Some Graham cracker is mixed in.

Epic.","vacax","Mar 15, 2009"
4.32,-2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Draught, Boulder Strong Ale Festival. This bad boy poured with a brown color that left a thin, creamy light tan foam. Nose of rich caramel-like malt and wood barrel. Flavor is very rich & chewy, with notes of caramel, toffee, apple, vanilla and sweet fruit. Sweet, strong, lots of barrel presence. Keep em' comin'","Crosling","Mar 14, 2009"
4.65,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow very dark brown with a brown head that fades pretty quickly. So much going on in the smell department, definitely bourbon coming through, but not overpowering, along with almond, vanilla, coco, oak, dried fruit, some alcohol, but not much. (i probably smelt this beer 5 times before even taking a sip). 1st sip, wow so much going on roasted malts, oak and vanilla, dry finish, with a caramel coating. I could definitely feel the alcohol in the 1st sip. After drinking more the alcohol wasn't as strong and you couldn't really tell you were drinking a 15% beer. Really a nice sipping beer, would love to try more from this brewery. Glad i had the chance to try it, SEEK IT OUT","bonbini26","Mar 12, 2009"
4.82,8.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Just when you think Pat and the crew can't further diversify their portfolio of beers, they do it again. And once again, quality is not an issue. This might be my new favorite Bruery beer, and instantly one of my all-around favorites. Well, until Melange No. 4 is conceived.","DoubleJ","Mar 04, 2009"
4.69,5.9,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: Absolutely impossible to detect 15% abv. Despite the intense flavor I could drink a lot of this. This is my first Bruery offering and I'm very impressed.","drseamus","Feb 27, 2009"
4.97,12.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Full body was thick and creamy, light carbonation. Amazingly drinkable for 15+ percent. I had way too much of this at the Boulder Strong Ale Fest, but I am very glad I did.","rye726","Feb 14, 2009"
4.49,1.4,4,5,5,4.5,3,"Drinkability suffers from the sheer size, but honestly, this is better judged as an after dinner drink than as a beer. Fantastic.","JohnQVegas","Feb 14, 2009"
4.64,4.7,4,5,4.5,4,5,"D: If I thought Partridge in a Pear Tree held its alcohol well this is exceptional. I knew the blend of the beer so I was thinking 10%, but I found out it was 15% and was shocked. Really it drinks like a 5% beer. I hope they have this on cask at a later date, I'd really like to have it again.","Halcyondays","Beers"
4.9,10.6,5,5,5,4,5,"Sampled today at the Bruery on Valentine's Day, reviewed this from notes on my cell phone, this is a blend of three bourbon barrel aged beers: Black Tuesday Imperial Stout, White Oak Wheatwine, and Papier, their 1st anniversary brew, I will start off by saying that this is by far their best beer to date and one of the better ones I have ever had period, color is a very dark brown, not much of a head, maybe a quarter inch and slightly bubbly, went away pretty quickly, this stuff just looked good, do not say that often but it was surely the case, there was a big bourbon nose, lots of roasted almonds and malts, very small amount of booze, oak, vanilla, milk chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, honey, buttered bread, and lots of caramel, flavor is so good, lots of caramel and toffee up front, roasted and bready malts in the middle mixed with vanilla and oak, finish has a nice caramel and bourbon finish, slightly dry in the aftertaste and keeps you wanting more and more, gots sweeter as it warmed after a few minutes and the complexities of the wheat wine component seemed to shine through, cannot barely detect any booze somehow, wow this stuff tastes great, mouthfeel was the only issue with this beer but it was still good, just a little thin at times, sweet, roasty, and tangy mouthfeel, soft carbonation, taste lingered a long time, what really makes this impressive is that is fifteen percent and you barely taste a drop of alcohol, I had to really look for it to even taste any, it was amazingly hidden, could drink a whole lot of this stuff and that would just get me into trouble because of its strength, fantastic drinkability, most amazing part of this brew, the attendees at the Beer Advocate Extreme Beer Fest will be lucky to have some of this stuff, too bad there is only a few kegs in existence, Patrick outdid himself with this one and I made sure I told him before I left, hope to have more as soon as possible, a blending masterpeice, highly recommended","Floydster","0"
