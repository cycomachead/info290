Sometimes sips are quite brandy forward while others are more chocolate and bourbon forward.

Aroma is sweet and heavy: Brown sugar, molasses, cocoa, fig, vanilla, bourbon. Doesn't really have some of the roastier notes or coffee that some serious stouts do but I'm ok with it. Taste is full bore sweet and rich. Tons of vanilla and fig, chocolate and cherry. Very very sweet, a bit too much if I'm honest. Feel is rich and smooth. Light carbonation. Overall a treat, definitely a slow drinker.","Samuel906","Dec 26, 2014"

Seamlessly integrated, with an overall impression of smores made with some bitter chocolate and a drizzle of booze. Delicious!","Georgiabeer","Oct 13, 2014"

But that sums up what this knock-out artist presents to the table. It shows up in a pitch black perfect form behind a beautifully typical piece of religious art work we expect from "The Lost Abbey" brewing company. The lowest score it gets from me is smell, for while absolutely aromatic, it isn't a blissful overwhelming sensation you feel that sometimes comes with the stronger stuff like this that ranks up to a damn near 15 ABV. Still, 4.5 is an amazing grade from me and it is shadowed by a phenomenal taste + finish that is sweet, smoky, chocolaty, and as my friend stated in song "A few of my favorite things". . .

Alcohol in your face. It was a total palate wrecker. Viscosity was thin-syrupy, low carbonation. Sweet aftertaste. There were particles of something left in the glass. Not sure if it was from the beer or the draft line. No lace left. This was part of a 4 beer sampler (all barrel aged) and I would say it came in 4th but that is because they were all pretty dang good. Definitely not bad and worth a try.","BVukelich","Feb 07, 2014"

It is very pleasant and has many of the qualities that I enjoy in beers. I know the expense of this beer is a big deterrent to many people but in my opinion because it exemplifies the qualities that i look for in big beers, good palatability, good taste, not a bad mouthfeel, and wonderful complexity that isn't overwhelming I will certainly be recommending this beer to others and purchasing it again.","Tonerelia","Feb 01, 2014"

The aroma is of brandy, bourbon and vanilla and taste mirrors that.

4,-7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a dark cloudy brown color ale with a large foamy head with good carbonation and some lacing. Aroma consists of bourbon with residual sugar notes and caramelized sugars. Taste is also dominated by bourbon notes with some caramelized malt and quite a lot of residual sugars. Some dried fruits and light chocolate notes are also perceptible. Body is full with great carbonation and surprisingly no apparent alcohol. Nice nightcap style beer.","Phyl21ca","Jul 15, 2013"

Part of me wishes I did not open this, given the fact I have no access to it until I revisit the US. Assuming the yeast is not dormant, this could age up to 10 years at 12.5 % abv and perhaps become amazing with age. This could also potentially fix the extremely poor carbonation issue. Overall, this is incredibly boozy and not for the faint of heart. If you are not a scotch or bourbon drinker, you may want to stay far, far away from this, as it is an aggressive punch to the head. Delicious and complex. I would buy this again, but at $17/ bottle, hopefully the carbonation isn't an issue when aging or drinking every bottle.","Agent1","Apr 18, 2013"

I got a strong sense of the brandy sweetness, more than I thought with the strong bourbon smell coming out of the snifter. It had a delicious alcohol flavor without too much burn, which was excellent.

Well worth the price of admission.","Knapp85","Mar 29, 2013"

I've been waiting for a while to try this beer and was only holding back because of cost. At $16 for a 12 oz bottle, I'm not going to drink too many of these, but I will drink them on days that end in a y. Great overall beer. Nice dark color, sweet vanilla fruity taste and good strong alcohol taste. Love it!","Heynow007","Mar 26, 2013"

Has the look, smell and taste of an Imperial Stout. But the not yet the feel of one but more of an dark ale. Only beer I've had of its kind is Bell's BA Batch 9000. Both blur the lines between beer classification. Did wish there was more of the aged fruit flavor. Didn't taste much, or any at all.","weonfire","Mar 18, 2013"

Poured aggressively and got a huge 3 inch mocha head with plenty of lacing. It pours a slick black and the head settles into patchy foam, but the lace hangs around awhile. Smell is bourbon, vanilla, prunes, leather, and roasted coffee. Taste is even better than the smell for me. Lots of vanilla and bourbon up front, with roasted coffee and bourbon lingering in the finish. Body is medium large, nice amount of carbonation, especially for its ABV, a little dry, but that is expected, and very drinkable for what it is. The taste assaults you in a great way every sip and makes you crave another sip. This is wonderful, but I would still take Serpent Stout alone over this.

The flavors of this beer are as numerous and complex. Many of the same aromas are found in tasting, as well as hints of fig, plums and dates. The alcohol is big at 12.5%, and a slight burn is noticeable in the finish. The strong and complex brew features a creamy, big body that is dominant over a low level of carbonation.

Smells great. The flavor is even more complex with an initial rush of fig and raisins and prunes before the bourbon and vanilla oak flavors come in. Roasted malt. Mildly bitter. Not hint of the higher abv, very impressive. Rich and full bodied with light carbonation. Finishes very smooth. Overall, this is fantastic! I'd love to pick more up and age.

Loads of malt...not much of a hop aroma. It's a bomb of fruity esters, alcohols, melanoidins, and sugars. Wow. The taste is not as sweet as expected....a solid keel of bitterness keeps the beer on balance. Alcohol helps too. Very warming...whew. Full in body, but a bit more carbonated that necessary.

Along with that, there's a blend of complex malt flavors - a little bit of chocolate, some roasted malt bitterness (which does help temper the barrel sweetness). The malt from the Angel's Share is hidden behind the prominent barrel character, but is still noticeable. Moderately drying on the finish, this beer finishes long with vanilla and flavors of brandy barrel tartness (NOT sourness) that's more akin to a pomace tannins and a mild vinous character. Medium in body and *perfectly* carbonated, there's a soft, lush carbonation that helps the beer slide gracefully down my gullet. Recommended, despite the high price.","DefenCorps","Aug 28, 2011"

Initially I get dark chocolate and dark fruit flavors immediately followed by bourbon and vanilla oak. Nice alcohol burn as well. Mouthfeel is EXTREMELY creamy with very light carbonation.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sweet alcohol, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and peat. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, raisins, peat, big sweet alcohol, dark chocolate, and very subtle wood. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one had a nice sweetness going on here with just a hint of bitterness to help bring it all together. Still pretty boozy though.

Thick, creamy, velvety luscious mouthfeel. A blend of brandy fruitiness and bourbon sweetness hit the entire palate and lingers and lingers. Full of toasty oak, coconut, vanilla bean,dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, tobacco, flint, oak, more woodsy boozy notes, prune, black fig, raisin, light anise, burnt sugar, molasses, reduction of dates and liquor.

The initial taste is sweet with some plum and bourbon. You also get some caramel, oak, chocolate, and brandy. The finish is pretty boozy with significant alcohol heat. Medium body. Low carbonation.

Its taste is of deep rich oaked bourbon, with notes of dark chocolate and a sweet vanilla with a slight caramel. When it comes to mouthfeel it coats the tongue with a velvety texture. Overall, I was pretty impressed with this blend. I have had both of the parents of the blend and by themselves are amazing.

It does seem to prove out my growing feeling that beers over a certain alcohol percentage should not be Barrel aged as they get too hot and boozy (which this one does).

Some dark tan bubbles even came up about a few centimeters and stayed, Bravo! Small notches that eventually let go. Smell is a tamer version of the bourbon barrel AS IMO, I still get alot of bourbon notes, less brandy and some roast from the serpent's. Oak and molasses. Very smelly. Taste is nice and the carb really adds a punch to this as well, Im use to flat bottles that go nowhere. Bourbon blended with roast and a sweet Belgian yeast strain, some vanilla clashing with faint brandy and some oak to round it all out. A dark tasty beer that is big. Feel is above medium with some faint but needed carb, LA keep it up. While I could not drink a ton of this, I enjoyed the 6oz's or so.","BARFLYB","Jan 16, 2011"

4.27,-0.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"375ml bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours one shade shy of black and completely opaque. Head is a quarter inch and mocha-colored and disperses almost immediately, forming a soapy skim across the surface and a thin band around the edges of the bowl. An arc of lacing is formed on the tilt side of the glass, with tiny raindrops of lacing cascading below. A big malty nose immediately reveals barrel aging reminiscent of Bourbon Angel's Share. A trace of booze follows, as well as brown sugar and perhaps licorice and a hint of vanilla. Taste consistent with nose; however, a pleasant buttery quality reveals itself as well as maple syrup - there's definitely some vanilla going on in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Some alcohol heat hits up front and gradually dissipates towards the finish. Carbonation is mild and balanced and evenly distributed from start to finish. This is a wonderful beer. I think I prefer Bourbon Angel's Share to Deliverance, but not by much. Quite a treat despite the $16.99 price tag. I think I'll definitely need to pick up another bottle to put a couple years on. I recommend picking this one up before it's gone.","Jwale73","Jan 01, 2011"

Brandy is more clear to me then bourbon, but I get both. It even smells a bit like booze. The flavor follows much from the nose. Lots of dried fruit flavors, vanilla, brandy and bourbon. Some less strong flavors of roasted malts and chocolate are clear but secondary. However they do add a nice complexity to the beer. Slick mouthfeel, low carb, expected and appropriate.

A respectable dark mocha colored head sits atop this one. At about an inch thick I'm down right impressed with the high gravity of this beer. After about ten minutes of staring at it I'm still left with a nice layer of creamy foam on top of a big dark body. The aroma is nothing short of fantastic. Rich aromas of molasses, dark chocolate, raisins, and bourbon. The bourbon is integrated into this beer nicely, it gives nice rich caramel/bourbon kick to the nose with only leaving behind a little bit of heat. Damn near perfect aroma as far as I'm concerned. Richness through and through on this. Flavors of toffee and caramel. Chocolate, raisins and spot on bourbon coat the tongue being just slightly hot on the finish. The mouthfeel is full and silky with just a bit of heat. Simply a pleasure to put in my mouth. The biggest flaw on this one, and with big beers in general is they are hot a boozy.

The color is almost completely black, with just a small amount of lacing as far as the head goes. The nose is of molten chocolate cake, molasses, and naturally brandy and bourbon. Wow, the alcohol is very present in the taste, giving it the feel of a spirit. Very similar to the nose, but there are some underlying fruit notes that makes it all the more interesting. Despite the heat from the alcohol, the mouthfeel is not especially huge, more in the middle I would say. The carbonation is also kept in check well. Like enjoying a spirit neat or on the rocks, this is one to sip slowly, and let develop as it warms to room temperature. Although grossly overpriced, this is another quality brew from Lost Abbey. I would be interested in trying the Bourbon barrel aged Serpent Stout, which is one of the brews (along with Brandy Angel's Share) blended in here. Cheers","jamie2dope","Oct 17, 2010"

The taste leads with all of those lovely dark notes, similarly to a rich imperial stout, but then a secondary wave of whiskey-infused oak criss-crosses the tongue, colliding with the original flavor inhabitants. It's quite an experience, and an altogether pleasant one, at that. The body is quite hefty, with a light carbonation and a syrupy, almost chewy feel. Honestly, if it were a bit thicker/heavier, this would have been perfect, I think.

Dark fruit appears mid-palate, and there's just enough tannic oak to balance the sweetness. The flavors lean toward Angel's Share, but there's a touch more chocolate, roast and dark fruit. It's great fresh, but it should be excellent in a few months when some of the harshness fades.","largadeer","Oct 11, 2010"
4.67,8.4,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"What a treat! Too bad it's $14.99 for a 375 ml bottle. I guess I'll have to wait to find it on-tap to sample again.","DoubleJ","Oct 11, 2010"
4.22,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Beer is medium bodied and sweet with mild roast at the back. The liquor components in the mouth are there but it was much more obvious in the nose than the palate. Beer seems mildly hot. Drinkability is still quite good and I would recommend it and try it again, especially after a year.","drabmuh","Oct 08, 2010"
3.97,-7.9,3.5,4,4.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours stout black (given that Angel's Share was pretty dark in its own right and it was blended with a stout this isn't surprising), with about a finger of caramel colored head rising up. The foamy cap lingers for just a second before dissipating. Not bad for such a big beer, but nothing out of the ordinary either. The nose hints that this beer is going to be an absolute chocolate bomb (fine by me). Even more so than that though is the smell of bourbon, and just a hint of brandy. The nose is decent, but a little too alcohol dominant. I find more balance in Deliverance as I sip on it. The booze is definitely still there, but the rich, roasty chocolate really asserts itself here. Especially as the beer warms and mellows out a little bit the chocolate becomes the main attraction. It's also a pretty thick beer, and overall I'd say it reminds me of Goose Island BCS, just a rich, viscous, chocolate and bourbon milkshake (although with a splash of brandy this time around). I can't say Deliverance is flat, like my last Lost Abbey beer was, but it's only just barely carbonated. A beer this big and rich shouldn't have explosive carbonation, but it shouldn't be something I have to strain this hard to find either. Deliverance is surely a sipper, as while I emphasized the chocolate when discussing the flavor, alcohol is definitely present as well. It works out to the drinker's advantage though, as I find Deliverance to only improve as it warms up. Now, if Lost Abbey could just get these beers properly carbonated ;)","axeman9182","Oct 03, 2010"
4.36,1.2,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"I've had nothing but bad luck with Lost Abbey's The Angel's Share (both bourbon and brandy aged) so this beer was both a relief and a revelation.","GhostMilk","Oct 02, 2010"
4.37,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"d - Overall I thought this was a very good beer. I didn't like it quite as much as the AS Grand Cru, but it was much better than the AS Brandy and Bourbon barrel bottles I have had. I really thought the nose and taste were complex and balanced. I liked the nose a little more than the taste but both were great. Would love to try again.","mdfb79","Sep 28, 2010"
3.94,-8.6,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3,"D: A must try for me, I liked it, but I'm glad I didn't pony up the $15 for the bottle, much cheaper on draft. It's good, but not that good.","Halcyondays","Sep 25, 2010"
3.7,-14.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a new belgium snifter. Color is opaque black/very dark brown, with a thin mocha head that fades to the outer edge. Looks identical to Angel's Share, but with carbonation. Smell is bourbon off the bat followed by lots of brandy. No surprise there, but it is nice. Lots of alcohol heat and a tiny bit of chocolate. Taste is a great blend of the brandy and bourbon with a strong hot finish. Slightly bitter, lasting flavor is of milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is VERY light carbonation and a heavy, coating feel. For the style it is appropriate, but just barely fizzy. Drinkability is low for this one due to the abv - its very filling. The complex malt and barrel flavors keep me wanting more though.","nkersten","Sep 24, 2010"
4.07,-5.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a tan head. Small amounts of lacing, but certainly respectable for a beer of this heft. Smell brings a lot, with brandy, bourbon, roasted malt, alcohol, dark fruits, and candied sugars all playing a role. Taste is quite similar, although everything isn't quite as integrated in that respect, and the alcohol heat plays a bigger role, which degrades a bit from the mouthfeel. Drinkability is very nice, as this is quite complex. I think age will absolutely do wonders to this one.","Thorpe429","Sep 23, 2010"
4.07,-5.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall this was one of the thinnest BA beers I've had in a while. The flavors were all there but just weren't substantial enough to stand up to the barrel influences. Still, it's worth a shot to see for yourself.","glid02","Sep 19, 2010"

3.4,-21.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The beer is just. too. hot. If something is uber compex you can get away with this much heat ... sometimes, but this is a pretty one-note sweet/bourbon blast of a beer. I think a lot of the nuances are being blasted into Bolivia.","Overlord","Sep 15, 2010"

4.52,4.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Thanks to Ratman for sharing this one last night. It followed a few other barleywines, and blew them away. Poured a deep, rich mahogany color, shot through with red, with a good 1/2 inch of light brown foam. Huge aromas of brandy, red and black grapes, raisins and booze. On the palate, I get a little roastiness from the stout, oak, caramel, toffee and dark fruits. I didn't pick up any bourbon, but this one got hot as it warmed. An excellent beer; very grateful I got to try it.","emmasdad","Sep 11, 2010"

4.45,3.2,5,5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"An epic brew. I only get a touch of heat and alcohol, and mostly in the nose as the beer warms. It's 12.5% though, and I like to be reminded that what I'm drinking is strong. I'm sure a year or two of age will make this dangerously drinkable though.","billshmeinke","Sep 07, 2010"
4.7,9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Finish is sweet, rich, thick carmel/toffee/plumed/cherry whiskey with espresso and black chocolate. Few "end of dinner," "dessert" or "sipping" brews can match this one.","GRG1313","Sep 06, 2010"
4.05,-6,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"I have a feeling this will be tremendous in 8-12 months. Right now, it's a little hot. Once this settles down and the boozy sweetness mellows, we could have a contender for best LA beer I've tried.","rudylaw","Sep 04, 2010"
