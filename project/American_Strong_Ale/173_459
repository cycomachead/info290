The look is awful, the taste is a bit on the medicine side, and it feels pretty bad.  I expected so much more based on what I'd read.  This missed the target on most fronts.","RickS95","Friday at 07:28 PM"

Maybe a mistake and under attenuated due to the strong sweet flavor and lack of carbonation.  Reading the notes saying there are 10 different hops used is interesting. This may have helped lead to the muddled flavors. 10 different hops is a lot to try to balance.","Jmamay22","Mar 27, 2015"

4.03,-1.2,4,4,4,3.75,4.25,"12 oz bottle shared by Kevin among a few folks at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into a taster. Brown-orange in appearance with a few floaties despite a careful pour. A two-plus finger head forms, stays for a while, then leaves spots of lacing as it recedes. Aroma is caramel, vanilla, alcohol, dried pears, and apples. Taste, initially, is moderate sweetness with caramelized sugar and dried fruit notes. On the finish there is a citrus hop flavor, rye spiciness, and alcohol. Full body, thick, chewy, sticky texture, soft carbonation in the mouth which is strange after the bubble show on the pour, and a finish that is initially abruptly bitter and has a warming boozy tail.","SierraFlight","Feb 25, 2015"

Smell is on the sweeter side, some citrus; resembles a barleywine. Taste is sweet:  sugar is the first impression, and it's pronounced. Small hop finish, unfortunately; espcially for one said to have 10 different varities. Feel is on the thicker side; very low carbonation. Overall, it's not what I was expecting and while not a terrible beer, it would not be one I'd go for again.","LouZ","Dec 21, 2014"

Rye and bready malts make for a great combination that work surprisingly well with the yeast's fruity esters. This is one beer I'm pretty excited to open in a few years!","BeerFMAndy","Jun 10, 2014"

A bit ugly. Huge sweet aroma of malt, some old citrus grapefruit hops, honey, caramel, smells soooo sweet. Flavor follows with a citrus honeycomb flavor, very sweet, lemon rind notes, caramel. Seems to be a lot going on here but verging on cloying. Syrupy thick mouthfeel with no carbonation. Totally flat. I’ve had Fred from the Wood, and I think the wood aging helps makes this a bit more drinkable. A definite sipper. Honestly this is better than the score I gave it overall if it had some carbonation. Very glad I got to try it though.","BMMillsy","May 24, 2014"

After 7 years in a bottle, this is still quite good...bordering on great. The American Strong Ale style is quite diverse and could result in beers that hardly resemble each other except for area of origin and alcohol content...with this said, it makes it very difficult to have an expectation of a beer prior to trying it. I find this beer to be fairly unique in flavor and aroma. Would love to try more recent vintages to compare, but at 7 years old, batch #69 is holding up well and a pleasure to drink.","portia99","Apr 15, 2014"

That particular combination is superbly executed, but between the color, the sweetness, and the lack of carbonation, I can't help but wonder if I'm drinking someone's failed homebrew. I expect the lack of carbonation is really divisive when it comes to grading this beer, or this batch anyway. I'm not really digging it but maybe it will grow on me.","hreb","Feb 04, 2014"

Pours moderately cloudy bright orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, pear, apple, pineapple, apricot, golden raisin, floral, grass, light pine, herbal, bread, rye, honey, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, pear, apple, apricot, golden raisin, floral, grass, light pine, honey, rye, biscuit, caramel, toffee, herbal, and floral earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, apple, pear, apricot, golden raisin, floral, grass, honey, rye, biscuit, caramel, toffee, herbal, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of hop and light malt flavors; with a great moderately crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, lightly syrupy, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent blond barleywine! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

I was trying a few brews before planning to spend the night in my car and after paying the tab the bartender hands me a bottle in a brown paper bag, "Wait a year before drinking this," he said. Almost 14 months later I finally allowed myself to unveil the identity, and it is easily one of the top brews I've ever tried.","Sark","Nov 12, 2013"

At least it paired extremely well with a handful of honey glazed nuts, but other than that, there's not much else I can go with this.","magictacosinus","Nov 01, 2013"

It pours a mostly clear golden-brass topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises thick honey, mild banana, biscuit, mild Belgian yeast, clove, and a touch of booze in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the booze and an overly-strong current of blunt sweetness dominating the proceedings. Honestly, things just seemed too sweet and disjointed to get much of a sense of the other constituent pieces. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a lightly syrupy feel, and a drying finish. Overall, like many Hair of the Dog offerings, this stuff didn't do it for me at all. It's too sweet and boozy for its own good, and it seems to want to insist upon itself rather than let me experience it in any kind of pleasurable way. God, I hope that makes some sense to someone other than me...","TMoney2591","Sep 16, 2013"

Something--namely Belgian abbey yeast--seems absent, although it is not missed. A strong burst of yeast-derived metabolites would only distract here. As it is, this beer is a focused and decadent beast of a malt-bomb. Although the official derivation of the name honors craft brewing royalty, I like to think that is also gives a nod to Fred Armisen and his Portland-inspired humor.","beagle75","May 17, 2013"

You get all sorts of fruit flavors; banana, cantaloupe, guava, and whatever else your nose is sensitive enough to pick up. However, the sheriff in this town is the Belgian candy sugar. It is so syrupy and sweet that it has a bit of a sticky taste to it. I picked up the slightest bit of hops toward the very end, but the sugar completely overwhelms all sense of balance.

Taste is fruity and spicy again, citrus hop, caramel and definite alcoholic notes. Mouthfeel is great except for the alcoholic aftertaste. Overall a good beer.

This is a sophisticated and impressively classy brew. The craftsmanship here is just impressive. I can't find a better word. Instant high respect and esteem for the brewers. Halfway through the glass I was already sad that I only had half a glass left. And only a 12oz! Accursed single-bottle limit! I agree with others who say to drink this cool and to savor it slowly in sips over an unhurried time. Treat it more like a digestif. I may need to rethink my reluctance to award scores of 5 after this.

Sweet malt and hop aroma. Sweet and hoppy. Caramel malt, some dark malt, complicated hoppy flavors, citrus and very sweet. The sweetness almost too much, but fits in fine with the other flavors.

Head retention is out of this world, ten minutes after the pour there's still a sizable chunk of white floating in my glass. The nose is great, with lots of earthy, spicy notes from the rye, and some fragrant tropical fruit and grapefruity citrus aromas as well. The menagerie of hops that went into this brew (supposedly ten different varietals) don't come off as well in the flavor profile. The fruity and citrusy components are a bit more muddled and not a crisp and clear. The rye comes through again nicely though, with a delicate spice. The body is surprising in that I was expecting it to be a bit more rich considering that a good amount of rye must have gone into the beer. The carbonation is slightly higher than average, which contributes both to the unexpected levity in body and the prominence of hop flavors and aromas. This was my first time trying Hair of the Dog Fred, and I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely look to pick more up in the future.","axeman9182","Apr 13, 2012"

Outside of the outrageous head, Fred otherwise pours a brilliant translucent straw haze of gold. The nose definitely showcases Belgian yeast, which is SO not my thing. It's amazing I even attempted to drink this. But in the name of science... The taste, fortunately, bids adieu to the Belgian yeast, as it is not present in the taste. This is pretty mild, actually. A little citrusy with a bit of spice to it. Fairly neutral, otherwise. The mouthfeel is very clean and fresh with a nice effervescence to it. Finishes with a dryness reminiscent of champagne.

It has tons of potential for storing and I cannot wait to try the Fred from the Wood and see just how much more complex this beer can get. What a great work of art this was.

4.08,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Plenty of rye grain with a strong touch of brown sugar and maple syrup. Carbonation is sneaky, resembling a quality Belgian; the mouthfeel starts as a slightly thick, less bubbly mass - but then as it slides down your throat a burst of carbonation arrives. The burst is a pleasant surprise, a perfect transition from the initial mouthfeel. This style will be too sweet for some, especially with the Belgian candied sugar being very prominent. It's very drinkable at 10% though, and is potently dangerous for any beer fans with a sweet tooth.","Mineo","Sep 08, 2011"

Very hazy rich golden color, initially about 3 fingers of head. Fades leaving a light film at the top of the body. On the nose, a lot of dried fruit including apple and golden raisins. Honey. A bit of spice (maybe Belgian yeast?). Some faded tea scents. Almost smells like a bastardized apple cider. Getting a nice booze warmth smell too, but it's not offensive. Smells sweet. Yep, it is. On the palate, sweetness hits first, Apple, honey, fruit, Belgian spices, a nice hop bitterness. And then a warming glow from the booze. Very tasty.

4.08,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Needless to say, I can read and follow directions, so I used a very gentle slow pour. It was testament to its carbonation that I actually briefly got some light-tan head before it faded to wisps. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was richly malty, like toffee. Mouthfeel was very full, quite carbonated with an initial heat followed by a wash of malty sweetness, quite toffee-like. Finish was warming and sweet. My oh my. Just what I needed on a swelteringly hot day.","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2011"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"O: This one is quite the curve ball! But make no mistake, this pitch is a strike. The flavors are really quite interesting, and the mouth takes the flavors for a ride. Flavor sensations of gummies, spices fruit flesh, and frothy non-alcoholic beverages shine like stars in the sky. This would be a fascinating offering to age, I just don't know what you'd end up with. The alcohol is very well blended, but not missing. Quite good, and shows many indications that it could improve with time.","Cavery","Jul 15, 2011"

However, if I had one major criticism of this beer it would be that it departs the underlying style so much and instead goes into such an IPA-esque territory, I'm not sure if this doesn't make me just want to reach for a better 'ipa'.

But I like it.","zeledonia","Jul 03, 2011"
4.15,1.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Snagged a bottle of this at my local place, one ofthe first beers I bought from there actually. This was something I had wanted to try since I enjoyed ADAM so much. The beer poured out as a nice hazy honey colored brew. It's not transparent at all. The beer looks to be pretty thick. The head it's pretty good to for a little while. The smell of the beer is strong with sweetness, boozy malts and a good dose of hop aromas too. The taste is sweet and has some elements of honey in there to me. There is a zesty hop bite in there as well. The flavors of maple I think are even coming through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this beer is pretty heavy. It's got a nice oily body to it that coats the mouth and lingers for a long while. Overall I'd have to say this is my favorite HotD release yet.","Knapp85","Jul 01, 2011"

I kept going back and forth on whether I should drain pour this, being conflicted that it might foam up and clog my drain and pipes, and then getting scared as to what is going to happen to my digestive tract. Eventually I lost the battle with this beer, getting knocked down by the yeast and carbonation, and then finally TKO'd by a surprising amount of sweet cloyingness that manages to rise from seemingly nowhere and assault me in the finish. Stay away unless you can get a guarantee you are getting a clean bottle, which from my now 0/2 track record from Hair of the Dog, makes me think it may be harder than it seems.

First thing I notice from the initial sip is how incredibly silky smooth this beer is. Very low carbonation but medium-thin bodied. Lots of sugary malt flavor up front, followed closely by caramel sweet estery fruit, some honey and rye. A touch of spicy hops in the finish and another smattering of malty sweetness coats the mouth with slick oiliness.

It smells of very bready sweet malts. I get A LOT of Bisquick biscuit dough from it. It also features a light but sweet caramel malt aspect that is rather subdued but pairs well with the aforementioned biscuity aromas. It tastes of sweet caramel malts with a nice honey covered biscuit aftertaste that is delicious. The whole profile isn’t typical of a “barleywine” but it works rather well. It is moderately sweet but isn’t overpowering in the least. It isn't overly sticky on the palate either but boy does the head stick to the side of the glass. It’s probably one of the most drinkable barleywines around. Overall this is a great beer from Hair of the Dog, once again.","aasher","May 31, 2011"

I have had Fred many times and dont remember it having this much carbonation. Smell is fruity hops, sweet malts, some alcohol, ripe fruit. Taste follows smell very closely, hops up front but not too bitter, almost overpowered by malts and honey, a bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit off. Medium heavy body and extremely heavy carbonation. There are no other signs of infection in this one so maybe a bit too much priming sugars?

Almost a touch de dolle- ish in the nose. Taste is still a bit hot. Maybe some taste of over ripened fruit. Maybe some banana, some dates and maybe plums.

The nose has a sunshiny honeyed quality to it, sweet tangerine and pink grapefruit trump the oats and granola, the latter sweet too, banana, nectarine and apricot fruit, caramel, malted milk balls, the citrus most obvious throughout. Full-bodied and creamy, full but soft mouth presence. The tangerine, lime, pink grapefruit big and bold here too, more honey, molasses, milk chocolate and caramel to increase the sweetness factor. Touch of vanillin tinged booziness, rye and oats without getting too grainy. Fruit cocktail nature to the nectarine, peach, apricot, pear, cherry fruit, straight out of the can. The carbonation accommodates the creaminess, more of a real slow churn than anything else. This does not strike me a "categorizable" beer, more an experimental hybrid.

Sticky mouthfeel, good effervescence, which will be a surprise to those who erroneously believe HOTD beers are under-carbonated. Pretty drinkable for this ABV.

Took about 7 minutes for it to finally settle and leave an incredibly thick and creamy two finger head. The beer itself is hazy and golden in color with visibly high carbonation. The nose is sweet and biscuity and well balanced. Although the aroma is not huge and bold, the flavor is. A mix of grainy and biscuity sweetness, floral balancing hops, and a vinous quality create a very complex but smooth taste. The body is heavy but the extremely high carbonation makes it an awkward drink. This brew finishes slow with all the complexity flowing to the end.","manahansf","Feb 24, 2010"

A slight lingering toasted malt flavor hints in the background under the lingering syrupy brown sugar, molasses, maple, and candi sugar. Very welcoming for the sweetness, roasted/toasted malty flavors, fruit, touch of bitterness, and how well the abv is hidden.

A bread and yeasty fragrance comes through and grows on the nose after each scent. A strong malty, bread, and yeasty flavors that dominates each taste. It finishes with a mild bitterness, bringing the flavors of grass and citrus, but never really comes out strong. A hearty feel, a heavy/medium body, ending with a chewy texture and finishing with medium dryness. The look of this beer was a bit shocking, having this much head. The aroma and flavor are very consistent and in sync with each other. The hearty and strong mouthfeel make this a solid beer.","cameraman","Jan 24, 2010"

The head was so big, I had to let the beer settle in the glass a couple times before I was able to pour the whole beer into the snifter (it's a 20 oz. DFH one). Aroma is citrusy hops (orange peel), bready malt, apricots, earth and wood. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some spice, candy sugar and a little bit of alcohol noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and creamy with high, but soft carbonation. Drinkability is good, the soft carbonation makes this brew easy to drink.

Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some hops bittering and a pruney/bready quality. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a lively, active background effervescence with a slightly dry character that nicely offsets the sweetness in the flavor profile and cleanses the palate between quaffs.

It was somewhat thick with smooth carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was a pretty powerful drink with unique character. Some flavor elements were good, but others were not, and they generally didn't mesh well. It had great body but the alcohol was harsh, so this was not easy to drink.

Other aromas as it warmed include plum and a fair amount of hops. Alcohol is very in your face in the taste, it has some heat. I would really like to have an aged one.

4.44,8.8,4,5,4.5,5,3.5,"Batch 74. Pours amber, very small head that dissipated quickly, but leaves some lacing. You can tell how thick this beer is because it's not very dark, yet barely translucent. smell is phenomenal. Tons of tropical fruitness imparted by the hops. I perceive pinapple and apricot to be the dominant fruits, but kiwi, mandarin orange, strawberry come to mind. They all merge together with the powerful malt sweetness. You can smell the belgian candy sugar. This merge, or more like a marriage, is even more apparent in the taste. The tropical fruity, yet not citrusy, hop profile is about as complex as I've ever tasted. If I remember, the label used to say that 10 hop varieties were used. it no longer does say that, which probably implies that they slimmed down the bill a bit, but with no loss for sure. It's damn complex. Don't mistake, though, this is not a hop monster american barleywine - malt sweetness plays just as big a role in this masterpiece. The only (and I mean ONLY) thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is that some alcohol flavor brings up the rear. Not harsh, not strong, but something I consider a slight flaw nonetheless. A year or two in the cellar would doubtless get rid of that, but with what loss to the awesome hop profile? Huge mouthfeel - not as big as the bigger imperial stouts, but big. Lower carbonation. Decadent. It took quite a while to finish the 12 oz, but more because I wanted to savor it than because it is hard to drink. One of my favorite beers of all time.","redmagik99","Jul 14, 2009"

It's slightly sweet, quite phenolic and very complex with notes of chocolate, caramel, leather and whiskey. It's pretty shocking, actually.

The hoppiness is quickly dampened by a nice nose of caramel, dark fruity esters and alcohol phenols. The taste starts with a cherry bite aided by the carbonation followed by muted hop notes of pine and spice. Before the initial hop notes let go a creamy sweet caramel maltiness surfaces along with toffee, a rye twang, mild of dark fruity esters and a hint of biscuit. The hops re-take control of the flavor with a moderate bitter assault that continues to the finish. It ends with hop bitterness, sweet caramel maltiness and an alcohol tingling sensation.

My only real complaint is that it's just too harsh...the hops are harsh, the alcohol is harsh and even the sweetness is a bit harsh. I would definitely recommend letting this one sit for a while...as I think that would improve the drinkability greatly.

Taste follows the aroma with strong citrus flavors, oranges, grapefruit as well as some nice tropical fruit flavor, and a good rye zing. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body, but still very refreshing, creamy but not overly thick, hop and rye malts create a peppery tingle on the tongue and a bite at the back of throat in the finish along with a warmth of alcohol.

Despite being nearly 13 years old, this barleywine has aged gracefully. The hops have essentially disappeared, leaving rich caramel and toffee, as well as complimentary oxidation.

The mouthfeel is sticky and thick, with a nearly perfect carbonation level (despite the high ABV) and a lingering bittersweet finish. The alcohol brings that "warm & fuzzy" feel to both palate and stomach. *cheshire cat grin* My overall impression is pretty high for Fred. As a burgeoning barleywine fan, this hit the complexity and flavor out of the park.

All the flavors come together beautifully. Hoppiness concentrated in the head and make the first sips somewhat bitter. Then it becomes sweeter with a sweet caramel malt with only a hint of bitterness. Alcohol well hidden in the flavor. Peaches and raspberries and big overripe plums are in the flavor too. Maybe could use a cellaring to reduce the hops just a tiny bit more as it becomes increasingly bitter as i drink. Full bodied without being cloying. Very drinkable. Overwhelmingly so.

Aroma had lots of overripe fruits, mainly strawberry, cherry and grape. The alcohol is also well hidden in the aroma. Taste starts off somewhat fruity and syrupy, then ends on a more dry grainy note. A bit of honey can be felt throughout as it swishes around the mouth. The body of this beer is pretty big, yet dangerous in its drinkability. The guy from Liquor World was right on the money when he said that this beer was a lot more calmed down from when it was new. In fact, I am pretty sure the last time I tasted it was in 03, and I can remember it being very hot. This is definitely a beer that has benefited from some time in the cellar.

This one poured a nice hazy golden amber with a thick white frothy head. A nice amount of sediment was visible as was a good deal of carbonation. The retention was excellent and this led to quite a good deal of side glass lace. There was a tremendously hoppy aroma, and this took me a bit by surprise, however I am learning this seems to be the norm from the brewery regardless of the style. There was defiantly a light fruit, peach, pear yeast component to the aroma as well, but the quick crisp citrus hoppiness of it really put it over the top. Such a nice medium body with great carbonation really let the flavors really pop and then linger to let you get the full experience. Very nice bright flavor profile, lots of lemon, and coriander mixed with a pronounced yeast flavor and a very nice light but noticeable bread backing. A slight hint of alcohol but nothing overwhelming and it was actually a nice little extra punch to it. This was a fantastic brew, as I am learning pretty much everything of theirs is. A really great big golden ale with a decidedly west coast hoppiness added in for good measure. This was a really cool thing to try and I would love to see this in regular rotation on my neck of the woods. This is a definite must try if you can get it.","mikesgroove","Nov 05, 2007"

4.71,15.4,5,4,5,4.5,5,"This refers to a 12 oz. bottle of batch 67 Fred poured in a tulip glass on 8/22/07. Pours clear, dark honey with thick bubbly head with bubbles ranging from v. small to 1/4" and small bubbles rising up through the body.l Nice, somewhat uneven lacing. Smells of warm, sweet malt with honey and doughy yeast and mild alcoholic scent. The initial flavor is big, malty, and sweet IF and a nice, long lived bitter aftertaste. The bitterness is strong enough that you can almost feel it in your teeth! Long lived, tasty, and very interesting. The overall impression is of a reasonably balanced beer although neither the initial flavor nor the aftertaste is particularly well-balanced. But the combination of the two creates a sense of balance because they are so big and so different. The transition from big malt to refreshing hop bitterness makes this possible. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with slightly creamy texture, lively carbonation, and somewhat alcoholic finish. This is an ultra-classic beer that has complex flavor and a beautiful appearance. Definitely a must for any tasting list. Stock up on a visit to Portland as it is not very common outside the Pacific NW.","walshclimb","Aug 27, 2007"

Very complex and original and as it warms up more and more shows. This is a must try for any BA.","franksnbeans","Aug 26, 2007"

3.99,-2.2,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"It's a bit of a gusher, but that bottle conditioning makes for a heck of a head. The aroma is a touch simple, mostly just like sweet, alcoholic malts. The flavor open up more with the spicy rye coming through over fruitier and light caramel malts. It's also like there's some earthy root flavors with the rye. It's almost like a strange mix of perfume with lemon, orange, and toffee. There's a balancing bitterness that makes a mouthfeel and drinkability worth mentioning. Tastes a bit like some American-made English barleywines, but the rye puts this in it's own dimension. Definitely an unusual beer, give it a try. It'll give you plenty to think about.","tempest","Aug 11, 2007"

Poured a beautiful hazy dark orange with little head, but excellent lacing. The smell had deep aromas of candi sugar, orange blossom honey, lemon zest, and brandied raisins. Wonderful. The taste is even nicer, with the sweet flavors being complimented by a great earthy, piney, hoppy bitterness on the finish. Big and on the sweet side like a barley wine, with additional flavors of sweet orange, fruitcake, sweet malt, and the same notes as were in the aroma. Mouthfeel is exceptional- smooth, creamy, and substantial. Excellent drinkability as well. It's definitely a sipper, but it is also immensely satisfying. Kudos!","Georgiabeer","Aug 11, 2007"

That would be like critiquing a princess' attire as you stood before her. This beer commands respect, and demands to be sipped rather than drank. It is not a hop bomb in the traditional sense, but has boundless hop characteristics. In other words, it isn't bitter, but has a ton of citrus/fruit/floral notes. And the sweetness from the malt is anything but cloying. Much like the Adam from the same brewery, I think the words that best describe this beer are "amazing, balanced and unique." Simply put, I love this beer.","jakon","Jul 17, 2007"

Hints of alcohol, german roasted almonds, grassy hop flavors, dates, prune, brown sugar made with too much mollases, pure maple syrup, and golden raisin. A bit spicey on the finish.

Palate is a delightfully sweet, sticky blend of sweet caramel malt and mildly fruity hops. Notes of plum, treacle, and biscuit come through, with a gentle warming from the alcohol building to a substantial heat at the swallow. Body is rich, creamy, and just about perfectly smooth.

Hints of chocolate and raisin also come through, and the finish carries a mild astringency. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The drinkablility suffers a bit from the brute strength of this beer.

Noticable alchohol warming at first, smooth full bodied mouthfeel with lots of spicyness. Fairly high carbonation.

Fairly clear dark amber reddish color body with the typical HOTD huge frothy tan head. Awesome retention and lacing as Ive come to expect from HOTD beers. Big ripe fruity nose with plenty of malt sweetness and still some bitter citric hops kicking around in the background. Alcohol is noticeable but doesnt detract from the scent. Flavor is really big with and upfront dark ripe fruit sweetness, caramel and a touch of molasses. A surprising about of bitter hops are still coming through in the flavor that keep the sweetness in check. Finishes up with more fruits and a slight bitter bite. Extremely smooth with a thick body with plenty of carbonation. Maybe a bit too much carbonation. Goes down easier than could be expected. Excellent Barley Wine all around that I am guessing was hiding in the back of my fridge for a few years.","meathookjones","Feb 14, 2006"

Moderately high bitterness was balanced by caramel maltiness and a bit of toasted grain. It finishes with some citrus hops and alcohol warmth.

Tastes of sweet malts, with apricot, fruit, then tart hops. The carbonation and alcohol contribute to a prickly buzz on the tongue, leaving a creamy mouthfeel and alcohol warmth on the tongue and palate. It's a potent brew.

A prelude to the flavor...all of the above and more. Creamy malted milk, spiced peaches, port, and floral and pine hops. Superb thick mouthfeel with soft carbonation.

All of the above smells are found in the taste as well; rum, spices, ripe fruits as well as a yeasty and hoppy taste reminiscent of a Belgian style ale. Gritty thick mouthfeel, interesting.

Its certainly lemon-like in that it makes you pucker but the overall tone is set in its rye flavored theme. The finish is bitter and dry with aromatic hops leaving a lasting impression. I do notice at the very tail end of the finish, the high alcohol content finally makes its presence known before once again fading into oblivion.

Super rich mouthfeel. A heightened sense of alcohol is noted too...but it enhances rather than detracts from the experience. The finish is long, luxurious and ultra bittersweet. Age has done this bad boy quite well, it's in amazing condition for being almost five years old and shows no signs of fading soon...although I'd love to try a freshly bottled sample for comparisons sake.

Ten minutes later, still working. Head is amazingly dense, and obviously, has great resilience, with incredible amounts of foamy laces everywhere. Aroma is sweetly of Belgian malts, a bit spicy, and a little yeasty. Taste is of spicy malt, with strong alcohol presence throughout, and a nice close with some hoppiness.

The flavor is very complex with a blended malt flavor that includes both kilned malts and regular malt flavors on the initial taste which segues into a very complex hop flavor. I find it very hard to pick out any individual hop varieties as the flavor is citrussy, earthy, with that distinct "noble" hop flavor. Tasting the dregs gives a bit more of the hop bitterness and a clean yeastyness. The body is exquisite as the chewy mouthfeel is complemented by the smooth carbonation which contains no carbonic bite.

The hops are lurking in there, too. The taste is--wow--like carbonated figs flambe (not that I have ever had that particular combination before). The alcohol, hidden nicely in the smell, asserts itself with authority, and the syrupy and earthy sweetness masks any hops I might have expected.

If I get the rest of this poured before the beer is room temperature My views may change and I'll amend this review accordingly, but as it is this is not a beer i'll be enjoying again if i am in Dorothy Lane Market getting coffee or beer and happen to see it.","StonedRugger","Mar 30, 2004"

Thick, chewy, sticky, fruity, gummy, yummy, this Fred is much like it's namesake, a unique, particular specimen that is rich in character and defies categories, a cantankerous, unruly ale that stretches boundaries and delights tastebuds.

Larger bubbles below and a fine self-stadnding foamy crown rising an inch above the rim. This settles down slowly over several minutes. Rings of clingy lacing remain with a large foam poof on one side. Color is hazy orange with a red hue. Smells lightly spicy (coriander? orange-citrus?), with nice hoppiness, and subtle maltiness and sweet candy sugar. Taste is very interesting, complex, and WELL balanced with a driving hoppiness holding it together. A tad sweet, but not exactly malty, and a sublte dried fruit undertone. A hint of warming alcohol at the end. Flavors carry on the palate for a good length of time. Mouthfeel is full, smooth and enveloping- excellent. This one grabs me the right way!

Aroma is mostly complex stages of hops, it's easy to believe there are 10 varieties, there's the big american C hops character combined with the refined English ones. Very relaxing to sniff on and ultra-complex, like a touch of vanilla on fresh citrus (grapefruit). In mouth this dances on the tongue, nice effervescence, creamy, full-bodied, complex malt sweetness and an obvious balancing yeastiness. This is a delicious big generous beer. Long Life HOTD. Tasting this with my buddy MartinT, we came to the conclusion that given the choice to pick only 2 beers from a same brewery to have an infinite supply of, HOTD with Fred and Adam would probably win over quite anyone. *High-fives Jazz88*","Rastacouere","Dec 09, 2003"

Very opaque, depending on how much of the yeast you add (do not add all of it; even a bit will give you plenty of liquid residue.) Quite carbonated. Nice lace on the glass. Smells: Alcohol, sweet caramel malt, varied spices. The flavor is very malty, very sweet. The spices permeate all aspects of the flavor, and the hops are strong at the end. The alcohol masks the fruity flavors, and keeps them from being distinguished. The aftertaste lingers of alcohol, and eventually you are left with just hop. Once again, not a normal golden ale. You have to prepare yourself for it (know the brewery first off) but once you do, this is quite an enjoyable beer. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, and has to be to help with drinkability (ironic.)

Aroma is of fresh varietal hops, a hint of grass, vanilla, alcohol, and sugary pale malts. Taste is spicy, flowery hops, sticky abundant pale malts, a bite of alcohol with a peppery, astringent finish. Moderately-strong floral bitter finish. Complex, yet not very balanced. Rich in body.

A big tawny orange/amber beer with enormous head. Pleasing aroma, a substantially malty beer with hops staying well in the background. Giant alcohol finish makes you wince. This beer took some getting used to. I had trouble with the first few sips; too sweet, cloying, alcoholic. By midway thru the glass I was starting to get into the swing of things, and by the end I was an assured fan. Chalk it up to either my palate getting into shape, the craft of the brew, or the giant dose of alcohol. Still I never know what to do with huge, strong beers like these; they are good for special occasions, sure, but little else. Whipping a bottle of this out during most social encounters may get you into trouble. Definitely not a summer beer. And when I'm looking for something strong and palate-demolishing, I usually bust out the scotch. This is a pleasant beery alternative.","Thrasher","Jul 28, 2003"

A whole lot is going on in the taste, with spice and pepper, hints of grapefruit, and a bit of hop bite. Everything really starts to come together after it has been sitting at room temperature for an hour or so. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. It's a definite sipper.","mickeymac","Jul 27, 2003"

If poured a foggy red and looked like most bottle conditioned. But the head was huge and did not stick together very well and there was very little lace to speak of. The smell reminded me quite a bit of the HSA with lots of salty smells mixed in with some strong bourbon scents. There was a fair bit of malts which hid the hops pretty well. The taste was too acidic and the hops tasted bland. It did leave a nice whisky burning in my throat and I would probably drink this again in the winter months. However, there was not enough complexity, which led to a bit of a dissappointment. I will not shy away from Hair of the Dog, but I recomend a careful look at some of the qualities Fred is lacking.

The first wave starts with the pour. Pour with caution because this beer creates an enormous, pillowy, sticky milky colored head. The first battle was lost by my fiancée who opened this and lost some of its wonderful contents due to the colossal head it created. The second wave of Fred's Blitzkrieg assault was launch with chemical warfare that wafted from the nose which is just as large as the head. Fred attacked with ripe orange, coriander, yeast, malt, flowers, spice, and probably much more had I had time to recover from the second wave. Then the third wave came just as shocking and surprising as the first two. The website says it has 65 IBUs and you can tell. Fred arsenal consists of hops, hops, and more hops. This attack is almost overwhelming at first and can be a sensory overload. Fred assails your mouth in this true Blitzkrieg of a lemony sweetness, then hops, then spice, then malt, then hops again, followed by more spicy and yet more hops. During taste attack wave I was distracted and didn't see the flanking assault by Fred's secret weapon carbonation. Fred's got more fizz than pigeon eating an Alka-Seltzer. And then my tongue steps on Fred's landmine alcohol. The bottle says 10% ABV, but Fred fights way out of his weight class. I've always heard "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog." Well Fred's a rabid pit bull packed into a 12oz. bottle. Fred campaign consumed eight casualties as we passed around this amazing brew. I don't know if age will settle Fred down, but I plan on being on Fred's side next battle.

Diacetyls and a sense of smoked meat begin to elevate upon warming. A sense of prickly hops emerge at the thick close, a testament to balance here.

Undergirded by a sweet maltiness, this beer has layers upon layers of spices (corriander stands out), citric hops, floral hops, and the rye seems to really add a lot of "pep" to this beer.

The flavors at cellar temp were difficult to decipher, maybe oranges and plums with an earthy hop flavor and steady bitterness finishing with alcohol. The beer had a creamy full body texture like a nectar. As we warmed to room temp things got a little more interesting (if this wasn't interesting enough).

I really can liken this to drinking a citrus blend juice, like an orange/tangerine/grapefruit mix.  There is a bitterness that lingers that I can't decide if it's appealing or not.  I think it is ok.  This is probably the most unique beer I've had in months and well worth a try if you have a chance.","Bighuge","Apr 13, 2002"
4.28,4.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This is definitely a very interesting beer.  Pours a beautiful golden color with a very thick, sticky, foamy head.  Heavy hops in the nose and alcohol as well.  Complex tangy, stinging hops taste dominates.  However, the beer has a nice chewy malt balance to it.  Nice effervescent creamy/sticky feel on the palate.  This is one incredibly different beer.  Not really like antyhing I've tasted.  I can see the comparisons to a barley wine but it is also very different.  Worth a try for the adventurous beer drinker.","Murph","Mar 25, 2002"
4.7,15.2,4,4,5,5,5,"I Love this beer and the brewery, what a line of products they produce!  Next to IPA's, Barley Wines are 2nd to me.  From the 1st sip, this beer says hello to you and demands to be recognized!  I wish I knew what hops they used, and, this is not a beer for the faint of heart at 11.5% abv you drink this one slowly and savor every beautiful sip, and why rush, alot of work went into to creating such a fine product, definitely  a barley wine lovers beer.","rosebud","Sep 12, 2001"
4.66,14.2,5,4,5,4,5,"Fred RULES!!!! I do not agree with the barley wine designation but other than the review was dead on. Jason and Todd's idea of putting this beer down and ageing it out is a good one. I have a case for Fred magnums in my beer cellar just wait for a party to see the light of day. They have been aging for over two years . Pat Savage from Hair of the Dog gave me a magnum of 1999 "Fred from the Wood" which means it was aged in oak.","mattmaples","Sep 06, 2001"
4.32,5.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: An extremely big ale indeed pushing 11.5% abv! It was hard to pick out any exact hop flavour due to the use of 10 different hop varieties. Try laying this one down for a year and see what happens. This brew will get your mojo goin!","BeerAdvocate","Aug 12, 1998"
