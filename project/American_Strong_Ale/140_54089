The aroma is dark dried fruits and tobacco. The flavor follows suit with a sweet caramel and raisin start. It finishes with a slightly bitter taste with a hint of roasted smokiness. It is a good balance of sweet and bitter. The mouthfeel is quite right. It is just thick and syrupy enough, but has just the right amount of carbonation to keep it light and drinkable. Overall, this is a very good beer. I wish that I had a few more bottles of this one. It could definitely last a bit longer.","Levich","Jun 19, 2014"

American Strong Ale is a good category for it, as it is quite complex and possesses qualities of an Imperial Stout, Belgian Quadruple and the earthiness of something that might construed as being barrel-aged.

Aroma is excellent with dark chocolate, brown sugar, toasted malts, earthy hops and semisweet dark fruit. I was a little timid trying this one expecting it to be very boozy but it wasn't at all. Flavors more on the dark fruit and sour fruit side up front with bitter citrus into the finish on a base of chocolate and caramel toasted malts in the background. Full body and light to moderate carbonation. Nicely smooth for the style. Very nice beer. Deceptively boozy. Good to share.","kylehay2004","Dec 09, 2013"

The color surprised me first of all, and was not a bad thing, but was much darker than I was expecting. Dark with bronze highlights when held to light and moderate wet head. Smell has lots of maple, brown sugar, and some malt, but is muddy and indistinct. Taste is the same... lots of the same flavors but nothing really stands out and it becomes just a sweet blur. Feel is smooth, a little sticky.. Definitely not my favorite from these two, and there are many other better American Strong Ale choices like Brown Shugga' and Deliverance.","Samuel906","Sep 06, 2013"

4.1,2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled 6/29/2011. Pours fairly clear extremely dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, toffee, molasses, toast, biscuit, wood, chocolate, maple, clove, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt notes with well balanced wood notes. Taste of raisin, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, wood, maple, molasses, light clove, roasted malt, slight char, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toffee, toast, raisin, chocolate, maple, molasses, dark bread, roasted malt, light clove, slight char, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of malt flavors with wood notes; with light hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale! Great balance and complexity of malt flavor and wood aging; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Apr 20, 2013"

I particularly enjoyed the birch syrup and the cream soda impression that it imparts. The body has smoothed out and developed a nice creamy and luscious texture. A decadent after-dinner beer that can be paired with an array of desserts. Maybe a pecan tart or simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I wish one of these breweries would re-visit this one.","ryan1788a5","0"

I bought a case of this 4 months after getting into "real" craft beer and had alot of trepidation after trying it in October 2011, but after 15 months of 47° cellering I fumble stucked into what I believe is a great cellered American Strong Ale.

4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Strong Ale, I tend to think of this style as stronger beers with unique aspects too them that don't make it fit in other more straightforward styles, and that's exactly what this beer is all about, and I like that. It had good drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but as it warmed it got to be a little boozy, splitting a big bottle of this with another person is the ideal amount to me, a whole bottle to myself might be a little too much. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the complexity of the aroma and taste, they were both pretty nice. What I liked least about this beer was how boozy it got when it warmed up, it wasn't overwhelming or too warming, but I thought that it could be toned down a little. I might be inclined to but this beer again, but it would for sure be for a special occasion since it's a little pricey, but I don't think I will see it around anytime soon. I recommend giving this a try if you can handle a little booze, you will be rewarded with some rich and complex flavors and aromas. I was pretty satisfied with this beer, I was looking for a strong and complex beer that I could sip on with my brother and that is exactly what this beer delivered, I think this beer could even be aged for a couple years, it might calm down the booze, and bring out some more malty and sweet flavors. I am big fan of collaboration beers and I am glad these two brewery's came together to make one kick ass beer, it's one trend that I would love to see more of and I can't see why it would be a bad thing. These two brewery's did a great job with this beer and I am glad I got the chance to try it, since this was the last bottle left, you can be sure that if you guys get together for another beer, I will be there waiting to get my hands on a bottle, good job all around.","StoutHunter","0"

Not much aroma, but flavor and mouthfeel are both magnificent. It carries a fairly persistent head, a nice delicate sweetness, a very pleasant mouthfeel, and only a mild hop bitterness.

While very malt-focused, it is otherwise balanced and without clear weakness. For those that think imperfection is beautiful, there is nothing here that stands out. While it is obviously well-made, it lacks some special trait that could simultaneously earn loyalty from some and enmity from others. Compared to the 2009 vintage, this seems safer, with less maple character, less booze presence, and overall just a lighter and more approachable beer.","beagle75","Jan 02, 2012"

The nose is interesting there is some dark fruit smell like figs, then a touch of sweetness and a little caramel also there is an alcohol smell but its very faint. Compared to the 2009 I had when it first came out this beer did a 180. Originally it was extremely boozy and over sweet. With two years of age this has mellowed out extremely. The booze taste is all but gone, just like in the nose I get dark fruit flavors like fig or black cherry, and a hint of maple. The mouthfeel got better with age as well, originally it was it very slick and viscous on the palate, now it is very light and the flavor does not linger on your touge. Over all this is with a year age on it an above average beer. very soild I recommend drinking your 2009's now.","phisigben","Nov 22, 2011"

Sweet flavoring here is really delicious and I can't help but think of the pure maple syrup and birch syrup that may contribute to that. Fresh dark coffee noted finish. Goes together very well with a cheddar cheese beef burger and fries.","albertjr21","Nov 13, 2011"

Smells a little hot, but doesn't taste it. The maple here is very subtle, and the birch is even more so. This is a shame, because the bitter and wintergreen notes of birch could work well here if they were amped up. There is a light, nutty sweetness, with a faint aftertaste of maple candy, some woodiness, and just a hint of birchy wintergreen. Very smooth, perhaps a tad too much so. With a bit more oomph, this could be a great beer.","Georgiabeer","Nov 10, 2011"

So out of the 22 or 24oz little fatty bottle it Pours dark brown with a tanish head. smell is of sweet caramel and chocolate. Taste was sweet like maple syrup, and finished a little bitter malt, much like semi sweet chocolate. This beer was great, very upset I can’t get more of this beer (batch one).

Sweet maltiness mixes with booziness, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, with slight woody and dark chocolate notes to round the whole thing out. Medium in both body and carbonation. Drinkable enough, though it's a little boozy and just slightly astringent which pushes this beer into sipper territory. Interesting and it grows on me for sure, especially as it warms. Some of the flavors remind me of drinking birch beer at the fair as a kid. Glad I tried it but I'm not positive I'd be rushing out buying it again any time soon.","MrHurmateeowish","Oct 04, 2011"

I am really enjoying the more birch, roast character that was added to this variation. The last Life and Limb had a lot o fussel heat and was quite maple-ly sweet. Even after a year of aging the first Life and Limb gained even more fussel and maple sweetness, but with this one I think it will age very well and may gain more of a maple/birch profile.

Taste is fairly nuetered. What am I supposed to be getting here? Maple? No...At least I am not getting it. Not cloyingly sweet at all, and not bitter. Not much of a hop profile. Cannot place the taste, but the only thing that comes to mind is charred meat. Body is good. Smooth and easy drinking. The alcohol is well hidden. Overall, this is a fairly underwhelming beer. It's main attraction is that is that it is a high abv that is relatively not noticeable with a smooth body that leads to easy sipping. But taste, aromoa...It's just not there for me.

Craft beer drinkers are not stupid and are rarely swayed by hype and some even take a perverse joy in countering the hype and panning the "overhyped" beer. And then there are some that take anything done by the "brewery of the week/month/year" as gospel and overrate it. In the case of this beer it does stand up to the hype. This puts the craft back into craft beer. You can taste the care and precision in which it was constructed.

That being said, it's a bit muddled and not terribly complex - I think there's only so much maple and birch syrup can add to a beer - so I probably won't actively seek it out again.

4.28,6.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Batch 2, poured from a bomber. I poured the beer into a schooner, and it presents with a huge pop when you pull the cork. The beer has a tremendously dense and thick foam on the pour, light tan in color, and very frothy, almost milkshake consistency. It settles extremely slowly. This massive collection of foam is resting upon a near-black, opaque, and thick looking brew. No signs of carbonation in the glass or on the pour. You have to break up the conglomerate of head to get your nose in there, but once you do, there is a blend of sugary sweet flavors, dark and rich malt, and a boozey highlight. The beer's flavors are dark and rich, with a molasses type foundation taste that springs some woody and smokey notes. The syrups are not overpowering, but the subtle sweetness and tang does come through as the beer further warms and settles. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and there is a thick, solid lacing along the glass. Again, almost like drinking a milkshake. The beer has a sugary sweet and roasted/toasted aftertaste, leaving a slight smokey flavor on the palate. The booze helps to keep the aftertaste quick and light, with a slick and fast finish. Definitely warms as you drink, and will be fantastic once winter-time rolls around. Very tasty!","GarthDanielson","Aug 26, 2011"

Body is on the thicker side with medium carbonation. Overall, an interesting beer, but I don't get why this is only sold in 750 ml bottles. Because it's a "special" release? To make more money? Why not sell this in a regular 12 ounce bottle given the high ABV and lack of drinkability? Ugh, the unnecessary oversized bottles are getting old.","waltonc","0"

3.03,-24.6,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Pours a nice dark brown. Aroma is maple, birch and booze. The flavor and body was where the beer started to go wrong for me. The maple/birch sweetness dominates to the point of being cloying. Considering this is a Sierra Nevada product, I was expecting some hop counterbalance, but there's almost none. The finish at least is a bit dry, owing largely to the high ABV. This might be better and more balanced after 3-6 months (or more) of ageing. The wood-aged version sounds good as it might add some bite, although this did seem to have a trace of woodsiness along with the syrup/sap of the trees. This was disappointing, especially considering the pedigree of the brewery.","HeightsEats","Aug 25, 2011"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an almost black body w/ great head that dies slow and leaves a lace ring. A mixed aroma as I pick up something close to that Belgian yeast w/ sugar and orange/citric notes, and I'm alsom picking up dry, roasted malts as well as somthing close to coffee or figs. Real smooth, almost creamy w/ great carbonation so it mixes in some crispness and avoids being too slick. I have to sip on it as this is also strong tasting at the same time; roasted and dry malts blend w/ a sticky, bready/woody sweetness (like caramel and maple are in there, possibly even burnt chocolate). All these malts work together and still balance with some lowkey herbal hops for a dry, somewhat bitter finish. This is a quality ale that mixes sweetness w/ heaviness and adds a touch of fruitiness to it and finishes crisp and dry - a superb ale.","clayrock81","Aug 25, 2011"

Background note of maple syrup, married to a resinous, woody flavor that vagely called to mind the more piney-influenced Anchor Our Special Ale editions.

The creamy head lasted throughout my pint and stuck to my upper lip. Nose is heavy malt. Toasted grain and caramel sweetness. Also some piney hops and plums. Flavor is a thick malty blast of caramel and burnt molasses. The same dart fruit flavors from the nose and then some hops kick in giving a resinous pine feel that leans towards having a bitter dry finish but it is smoothed out by the large malt body. Creamy with a semi-dry finish and little trace of the alcohol. Satisfied with splitting the 220z.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 07, 2011"

Scent is cocoa powder with some hints of maple syrup, booze, and a lot of malt. Scent is familiar of a strong scotch ale or wee heavy. As the beer warms, the syrup and molasses really come out, along with a bit of honey and more chocolate. Taste is very similar to the smell. I read a lot of reviews saying that they don't really pick up the maple syrup in this beer, but I really get a lot of it. I get the maple syrup with dark fruits and dark chocolate. Tons or roasted and caramel malt as well. Hints of booze as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. This beer had the potential of being overly syrupy, but it is not at all. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a tasty beer. I had this the first time it was released, and was not very into craft beer...so I guess I didn't appreciate it for what it was.

A full on blast of spiced alcohol was the first thing that I noticed, kinda hot, but as it warmed it mellowed out and by the end of the session had all but blended into the background and simply become an outstanding ale. Loads of dark fruit notes were permeating through the flavor. Prunes, Raisins, Figs all very discernable in the flavor and really adding balance to it as they melded together. Lots of spice here as well, very big. The notes of oak and wood in the flavor were clearly becoming evident as it warmed, giving it a very subtle, yet very powerful presence. I can see why people rave about this; it is very unique, very dark, and very seductive almost. The flavor really needed some time to catch up with you, the first few sips were nothing compared to the last few, really outstandingt silky smoothness that really lets the flavor pop and keeps it from getting too heavy.

Dark hazy brown color. Nice sized white head that stuck all the way up the glass. A wonderful aroma of brown sugar and molasses. Taste was just as good. It had amazing flavors of raisins, maple syrup, and sugar cane rum. Mouthfeel was very smooth, as I think the one year of age helped corral the 10% abv heat. Drinkability was high on the scale too, as this beer hit the nail on the head in every way. Wish I could have gotten my hands on a second bottle now.

The sweet, almost sugary, flavor grabs the palate at the start of each taste. That is followed by a dried fruit flavor, with a mild bitterness takes over and finishing with sour and tart flavor. A medium to heavy feel, with a dry and boozy finish. This beer is unique in the fact, that you don't know what it is. It has the darkness and color of a stout or porter. The aroma and flavor has Belgian aspects, with a feel and finish of some IPA's.","cameraman","Sep 13, 2010"

These flavors lead up to the sweetness of maple syrup. The maple sweetness is complemented by a smooth but still semi bitter taste of hops that balancers out the sweetness. The birch syrup is also present in the beer and adds a unique kind of grassy, tree like taste: this gives the beer a hugely unique taste.

But for $10, it' s a good beer that I would suggest you age and see if it gets any better. It poured almost black. It smelled like molasses, raisins, prunes, chocolate but no hops. It tatsed like dark chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, and it was a bit spicy. It was thick in my mouth and you can definitely taste the alcohol.

A dark, dark brown with the slightest hint of dark orange edges, poured smoothly but lighter than expected. An opaque dark brown and trace head and lace with a dark sweet cocoa aroma and standard hops did not impress, but certainly did not disappoint. A bit standard tasting as well, but tasty at that, with dark chocolate, coffee, plum and a dash of hops in a medium body and quite drinkable. No complaints here, I just expected more for something initially called a Belgian Porter from Sierra Nevada & Dogfish. My fault I suppose.","selecter70","Mar 14, 2010"

The taste follows a great deal, with the malts, molasses, raisins, figs, and plums coming through, along with a darker bit of syrup, oak, some hoppy bitterness, and even a tiny hint of smoke. The body is lightly heavy, with moderate carbonation and a very thick, chewy, and still somewhat smooth feel.

2.84,-29.4,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,2,"Pours dark, but not quite black, a nice deep mahogany brown, with a hint of blackness in there. The head is very thin, the bubbles fade fast, and there is absolutely no lacing. Looks average - and I have no idea what to expect from the sight. The smell has a big of coffee and chocolate in it, but there's a rum-like sweetness, which is probably just the smell of alcohol that comes from a source other than fermented maltose. I can even smell a bit of tobacco leaves in there, earthy and herbal kind of. The smell is kind of lost somewhere between a mixed drink, a belgian quad, and a brown ale. But still, a little more enticing than the look. The flavor is fruity. Reminds me of rotten plums, like the ones that fall off the tree and have laid there for a couple days. I can taste the maple syrup, too, dried out from fermentation. There are flavors of wood, rum, and toffee. I get a bit of the roasty, chocolatey in there too. And I can taste the leaves, like burning leaves - not in a bad way, but like earthy, nearly charred, herbal flavors - kind of like the tobacco from the smell - a combination of the hops, probably, maybe a bit of the darker malts, and the fermentation temps (ester production) are the most likely culprits for this. I guess a lot of what I've described sounds bad - but the beer isn't actually bad. I will say that I was interested in it, which, actually, I suppose, usually means something bad from a beer persons mouth. I can definitely taste and feel the alcohol, but he body is kind of medium, thinner than a beer this strong should be. The carbonation, for what it lacked in head production, sure does bite in the beer. This beer, for what it has in pre-drinking intersted, kind of lacks overall. It was okay, but not sensation, probably would be worse if it didn't have SN and DFH name on it - you know? You really kind of wan to like it more than you actually do.","taylorhamrick","Mar 07, 2010"

I am not sure if a beer can smell dark brown, but this one does. Brown sugar, toasty malt, some maple and perhaps a hint of pine. The taste is quite wonderful and much more balanced than I had expected. There is definite maple flavor in there, but it mingles well with the dark malts and a very nice brown sugar/molasses like malt base. Other guests to the flavor party include chocolate, coffee, raisins and even some pine. It is worth noting that this beer carries much more bitterness than I expected. This is definitely a welcomed attribute. Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium with a somewhat sticky finish that seems appropriate with this brew. The alcoholic warmth is definitely there, but not in your face. I would not call this a session brew by any means, but it is a great sipper and a fine collaboration between two of America's best breweries.","zoso1967","Mar 06, 2010"

No, but I didn't expect it to and, really, the excitement surrounding the release of this beer last fall was more about its sometimes extreme scarcity than it was about the quality of the beer itself. That being said, it is an enjoyable and unique beer. Much of what it going on here is caramel malt character that dominates the flavor and aroma. It has a satisfying richness, but it doesn't come across as engrossingly complex as some English Barleywines and Old Ales do. Fortunately, the dark caramel is not all that this beer has to offer. There is also a significant depth of character and complexity that is imparted the the use of birch and maple syrups. These complex sugars seem to give the beer an agreeable molasses quality while also imbuing it with a spicy essence that is much nicer that the spice character found in most beers that contain actual spices. Overall, it functions as a nice, smooth winter warmer that hides its alcohol well and incorporates some unique spicy characteristics without overwhelming the drinker.","nickfl","Feb 26, 2010"

Taste isn't as sweet as the smell, but the vinous qualities are still present. You can really tell that SN is involved with this brew, as the hops are more prevalent than in most Belgian Strongs. That being said, they're well integrated, and enhance the experience. On the other hand DFH puts it's mark on things with the sweet, brandy-like sweetness that lingers throughout.

Very close to black in color but stays within the bounds of darkest brown, a touch of orange gets through at the rims. Relaxed and easygoing nose of milk chocolate, raisins and dates, honey, rum, molasses, gingerbread, sweet but not "sugary" per se, quick burst of pepperiness and trace of earthy leafiness, minimal hops presence. Full-bodied, not heavy but has a big bottom, not a beer with swift pacing in the mouth. The carbonation has a nice fineness to it, not too fluffy. Straightforward caramel, honey, molasses, chocolate flavoring, little deviation from the nose. More breadiness and powdery texture. You get some mixed citrus zing and generalized hoppiness but little of distinct character. Earth, straw and pepper bloom through the finish. Maybe even some bacon. Solid, if unspectacular.

It has a warm, roasted malt scent along with some burnt toffee and hops. I guess the Birch and Maple add some aroma, but it's muddled within the malt bill. The taste is great! It has a complex array of flavors that begin with a solid malt bill of pale and roasted malts along with very nice hop character. The maple and birch syrup adds another layer of complexity. The maple character really compliments the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer.

Maybe its a yeast thing, but as soon as I tasted this I thought DFH. Light carbonation, big body with a creamy/syrupy mouthfeel.

Okay lacing. Strange nose. Can really smell the maple syrup and roasted malt. There is a smell in there I just can't describe. Like a molasses/tree bark/wet leaves/cocoa powder mess. Its not pleasant, but interesting. Taste was okay. Coffee, cocoa, maple syrup and the birch as advertised. Reminiscent of the Sam Adams Root Beer from that 1700's/Presidential series.

This beer is delicious as it sits in your mouth, but around the time you swallow, rather than getting a balancing blast of hops to mellow out the sugary taste of this brew, you instead get an intense blast of even stronger sweetness which is frankly a little overwhelming. Most upsetting to me is the mouthfeel of the beer, which is expectedly thick due to the maple-syrup, but is quite hard to handle, no matter how hard I try to appreciate it for being exactly what I anticipated. Wouldn't it be possible to make a beer with maple syrup that feels like BEER in your mouth? This feels more like syrup. In the end, this is one hell of a sipper at 10.2% and I'm feeling every bit of the alcohol in my brain, and feeling every bit of this thick syrup marinating in my stomach.

Starts too hot when it's cold, I definitely recommend letting this one warm up and open up. Smell evolves nicely into some dark nutty and earthy tones, and the alcohol recedes in the taste and is replaced by a nice sweetness from the syrup. Some leafy hops in there too balance some of the sweetness with some bitter kick. Woody notes in there too. Definitely a unique beer. Very creamy and full bodied, perfect carbonation to keep it moving. A great sipper, and one worth trying (although maybe not worth the hype).

Taste is terrific I think. A very complex body with some dark fruit, syrup, oak, caramel and some vanilla as well. I've read some other reviews and haven't had vanilla come up but I swear there is a little vanilla in here. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect I think. A very full, creamy, velvety quality to it.

The maple notes are there too, again this is reminiscent of some good dopplebocks I've had, maybe Samuel Adams Double Bock + Celebrator + maple syrup.

4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Obviously much anticipated,I am glad to grab a few bottles before they are gobbled up here in my area.Poured into an oversized wine glass a deep dark brown with some deep reddish colored hue when held to the light,a large clingy off white head atop.A mix of a whole lot of good stuff going on in the nose,winter spice,molasses,roast,and resiny hop comes through.Flavors are quite sweet at the onset with mollases and spice,some leather and dark fruit also show up,then a deep resiny hop flavor comes and really finishes this beer out as good as you can.Big chewey and mouth coating,you cant ask for a much better mouthfeel.Man I really like this beer,many times a anticipated beer doesnt live up to the hype,this does.","oberon","0"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Spilled some on my hand when I was pouring the beer. It was really sticky and I thought, oh great, this is going to be sickly sweet. Smelled wonderfull; fruity yeast, slightly roasted malt, some maple. Again, Im thinking this stuff is going to be thick and cloying. I was wrong, boy is this a well balanced beer. Biscuit and faint roast from the malt, clean bitterness from the hops and some maple, but not much. Slight alcohol heat, which I dont care for, but its not enough to ruin the experience. There is some sweetness, but the hops do a nice job of countering it. The body is a lot lighter than I expected, it is slightly oily but overall Id say its medium. It has a fair level of carbonation, which aides in elevating this beer out of the heavy catagory. Overall, this was a great beer. Id imagine that in a few years it will be nothing short of amazing.","mjryan","Nov 19, 2009"

4.33,7.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown with glowing ruby highlights. Firm sheet of lace lasts throughout. Sweet malt, dark fruits and a hint oak aromas. Dates, maple syrup, and subtle wood flavors lay down a nice foundation. Very complex. Nice subtle chocolate and light roast coffee flavors on the finish. A light spicy note is there as well, maybe from the hefty 10+% alcohol. The abv is extremely well integrated even so.The body is full on with a light and lush carbonation. Comfortably numbing stuff. This one gives you plenty to ponder while your sipping away. Excellent.","drunkmonk","Nov 19, 2009"
4.5,11.9,3.5,3.5,5,4.5,5,"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a dark ruby with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is slight maple and dark malts. Taste is an absolutely wonderful blend of maple, sweet malts and wood, very complex and very tasty. The beer is medium body with fairly well hidden alcohol. This one is truly special, definitely worth the hype.","atsprings","Nov 18, 2009"
4.95,23.1,5,5,5,4.5,5,"It is Dark and choclate colored it has a really good head and belguin lining. Also a nice aroma of vanilla syrup and caramel. A lot of different flavors especially once the beer warms up. Very easy to drink and you cant even notice the beer is 10.2%. Sam and Ken did a great job together on this look forward to what they will com up with in the future!!","AcesandAles","Nov 17, 2009"

4.18,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Amazing drinkability for its high ABV. The creaminess and solid body on this brew demanded another and made for a seriously sessionable beer.","cptierney","Nov 13, 2009"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O- I like this beer, it reminds me of the syrup my grandmother would pour from a tin can on to our waffles. Its different and the maple and birch come through to dominate the flavor profile. This would be a great breakfast beer. Very good collaboration guys.","DwnTwnBwn","Beers"
4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I really enjoyed this beer. It reminded me in a lot of ways of DFH Palo Santo Marron without all of the wood flavor. A great collaborative beer and one that I look forward to revisiting with some age on it.","mjl21","0"
