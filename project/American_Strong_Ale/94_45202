3.98,5,3.75,3.75,4,4.5,4,"Oh boy, we've got a big one here. Bright tawny hue, topped with a tiny bubbled lacing. Floral alcohol, biscuity malt, & mild fruitiness in the nose. Creamy, smooth, almost cordial-like. Boozy but not hot, biscuity malt from start to finish. This is a massive brew, easy to sip but the alcohol gives a kick to the palate letting me know I should be taking my time. Beer geek delight with this one.","Jason","Feb 24, 2015"

Although similar in format to Otter Creek's 20th Anniversary Ale (another 'Imperial German Altbier' brewed back in 2011), Triple Bag is superior with regards to its pleasant body, non-cloying flavor profile and lack of alcohol presence in the nose, taste and feel. I really hope Long Trail keeps up the momentum with their bigger beers with Triple Bag staying in more regular rotation. (4.75)","threeviews","Dec 28, 2014"
3.92,3.4,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"Paid $3.99 at Cheese Traders for a single 12 oz bottle that was about 13 months old (11% ABV - 65 IBUs).  Poured into a large tulip.  Beer is a clear, slightly dark, reddish copper color with a finger of off-white head that lingers and leaves beautiful tracing.  Aroma is of caramel, molasses, slight citrus and some dried fruit or candy.  Taste is slightly boozy but has nice notes of malt, caramel, molasses and is balanced nicely with a bitter finish and lingering booze.  Mouth feel is nice...full bodied, slightly slick, with ample carbonation.  Overall, I liked this beer.  I haven't had Double Bag so can't compare them, but this was an enjoyable beer for a winter evening.","FFreak","Dec 24, 2014"

4.32,14,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,"The beer pours a dark candied brown, with nice hints of amber in it. The beerâ€™s body is clean but cloudy with a haze, and the beerâ€™s head is very lightly tan in color. The beerâ€™s lacing is thin and slick, leaving slippery lines of foam on my glass. On the nose, this beer is big and pungent from the moment the cap is popped. Beautiful rich malts leap from the bottle, the glass, and whatever other container you might have this beer in. When you stick your nose in the glass you get sweet notes of brown sugar, raisin, prune, slight maple syrup notes, and a surprising amount of creamy and also unripe banana. On the tongue, this beer is creamy sweet, bringing raisins, banana, brown sugar, caramel, and slight toasted malts on to the tongue. The beer begins with sweet brown sugar and a touch of maple syrup before opening into raisins, then prunes, then a touch of dates and lovely toasted caramel malts before the beer hits the finish of banana, raisins, and brown sugar. The aftertaste is beautifully long lasting, giving hints of both ripe and unripe banana and brown sugar. On the mouth, the beer feels slightly below heavy but chewy in body and creamy smooth on the tongue. The mouth is left dry on the sides but swimming in saliva on the middles of the tongue. Overall this beer is fantastic, sweet, and complex. I love how this beer is specially made from the first runnings of the mash as that adds a certain amount of fanciness to it. I also love how it smells and how it feels on the tongue, and especially how it tastes. This is a beautiful sipping beer that is ripe with flavors and doesnâ€™t quite touch on the common flavor profiles of other big beers. This beer is a winner. Try it.","Maxwell","Feb 15, 2013"

Mouthfeel is silky and creamy, and there is a hint of alcohol on the swallow, but it's very subtle. This goes down a little too smoothly for a 9.25% abv ale!

3.95,4.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle served in my Maudite tulip. Pours a deep brown, not quite the color of cola, with a one inch, loose, cream-colored head that quickly dissipates into a rolling, sudsy froth that coalesces around the edges. A half moon swath of delicate lacing encircles the bowl. Nose expresses dark malts and dark fruits; aromas are somewhat akin to an Americanized Belgian Strong Dark. Taste follows nose; however, there's also an interesting bubblegum quality (maybe grape), as well as a faint yeast presence. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even carbonation that falls short of lively. I've been looking forward to trying this for a while and I have to say that I'm pretty pleased with this beer. Definitely the best brew I've had from Long Trail and I hope to see this added to their line as a seasonal rotation. I definitely plan on picking up some more to lay down for a couple years.","Jwale73","Oct 08, 2011"

3.72,-1.8,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Draft at the brewery back in November of 2008. I decided to try it based on it's limit brewing, despite the fact that I prefer hops to malt. Clear burnt orange pour with a thin off-white head. The aroma is an abundance of malty sweetness. Taste is similar with a European hop finish.","gameface23","Aug 05, 2009"
3.65,-3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Off the tap at the Scuffer (thanks Mike & Mike!) this brew was a dark amber/copper color with an off-white head. The retention was not very impressive but the lacing was adequate. The aroma was sweet and spoke to me of rich malt, green apples and some sourness and vinegar. The flavors were of caramel malt, toffee, ripe fruit and fruity alcohol esters with a slightly bitter and hop-filled finish. Though pleasant enough I continued to feel they missed the mark for the style. The mouthfeel was nice and the softer carbonation helped the beer be quaffable. But the Double Bag was still better in my opinion.","thekevlarkid","Jan 26, 2009"

Worth a try, but keep your expectations in check.","Gambrinus1184","Dec 14, 2008"
2.86,-24.5,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Draught: This one pours a somewhat ruby tinged mahogany. There was almost no head and lacing. I was not quite sure what to make of the aroma. There was a sweetness to it, but it lacked any kind of caramel, toffee of fruits that you might expect with a beer like this. It smelled a bit astringent. There was not a lot of sweetness to the taste. In fact, it had a very dry finish. A bit of alcohol to the taste, maybe some fruits and caramel, maybe a bit woody. I do not think I will be drinking this one again. It just was not that good.","Boto","Dec 10, 2008"

4.03,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,3,"M&D--Definitely a sippin beer, as the mouthfeel is more or less like trying to hold a water balloon in your mouth.
