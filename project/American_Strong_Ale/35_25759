From the deep ruby hue, to the warm, inviting smell, next to the way it just coats your mouth with deep, dark fruit flavors, I just can't get enough of this beer.

4.59,2.9,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Overall (4.5), what can I say about this beer. Prior to having it, it's one of those beers that it's easy to remain aloof about--the price point is so over the top that thoughts of "how good could it really be?" come naturally. I've always wanted to try it--mostly for the novelty of a 30% "beer"--but also recognized that it would surprise me if the opportunity never presented itself, given that I wouldn't go out of my way to procure a bottle and probably would balk at the cost if one ever crossed my path. Now that I've had it, I can honestly say that I would actually have to talk myself out of buying a bottle if I came across one, and that in spite of it's high rating on BA, I think it might actually be underrated. It's just an amazingly well-done and envelope-pushing beer.","LambicPentameter","Jan 11, 2015"

Like an aged 120 minute IPA, with a HoTD Matt, and a Bruery BBA Melange #3, and some cognac tossed in for good measure; something everyone should experience at least once, if not buy it for future delights.","stouts4me","Oct 03, 2014"

4.62,3.6,,,,,,"I was lucky enough to taste the most recent two releases (2012 & 2103) side by side, and I have to say that the addition of KMF made a huge difference. It definitely added a lot of extra fruit and sour notes that seemed a bit more muted in the 2012. It's one of those brews that's worth the investment for any beer geek out there, if for no other reason than to say that you've had it. A co-worker of mine still had one from 2008 and we tried some of that recently. The more vibrant notes in fresher batches mellowed out, giving way to more robust bourbon and port notes. Overall a fantastic brew.","mr_monch","Sep 26, 2014"

This is deeper and more complex than any whiskey or bourbon I've had straight, and could easily meet your needs for that kind of a drink. Despite the price tag, I can now easily see myself buying one of these to crack open on special occasions, or even for a special nip before bed.","Roguer","Sep 23, 2014"

I cant read my notes only remember what vintages stood out. 2013 with the little window in the bottle was actually my favorite, I expected to like the older ones more. 2005 and 2009 are marked as the next best. Of course none of them held a candle to Millennium, the whole group agreed with that. Flavors were all big sweet malt, toffee, lots of warm vanilla, old tawny port.The 2013 or whatever the most recent bottle was had more developed rich flavors and not as cloying on the tongue.

Fruit cognac amplifies and embitters the fruit, producing a hyperevolved and lightly burny version of, say, orange juice, where the sweetness hasn't gone away so much as it's lapped itself. So take the sweeter pale malt nodes favored by Sam Adams and then amplify them so much they retain only their barest essence. And the somehow, remarkably, make it pleasurable to drink.","mynie","May 05, 2014"

The only minor negative for me is that it is syrupy and thick not like traditional beer at all. I do get that this is stretching the definition of what beer is and I like that spirit but I kinda like beer where it is.

Also notes of brandy and yeast on the nose, maybe even champagne. Flavor is similar but less boozy than the nose - surprisingly easy to drink, especially considering the ABV, but definitely a strange brew. Very interesting.","ljthiesse","Apr 28, 2014"

Utopias is one of the few end-points of beer fandom, and is almost worthy of its sticker price (I'd say shelf tag, but, heh, it never actually made it there, around here). My only real beef here, is that I can only make an educated guess as to how much I have left in the 'bottle' - I'm thinking at least 16oz, as this kind of thing surely engenders more writing than imbibing, eh?","biboergosum","Mar 29, 2014"

4.4,-1.3,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.75,"the good people at boston beer brought five gallons of this to big beers in vail this weekend, and i have to thank them, because i would never be able to afford to try this one of a kind brew any other way. with much anticipation my glass is filled with a hazelnut colored liquid that shines mellow bronze on the edges and has essentially no head. the nose is hotly alcoholic, i smell it long before it even gets to my nose, very intense. but i also smell rich malted barley, the start of homemade caramel is white sugar just sweats in the pan, and a woody vanill vibe that reminds me of a good bourbon. the taste is more like a cognac than a bourbon or a beer through, and thats what i notice the most. its not nearly as sweet as it smells either, but has some necessary residual sugar to soften the alcohol burn. it almost feels distilled instead of brewed. i get a ton of wood on the finish, like a combination of countless barrels. its a little bit of everything rolled into one, but it somehow, to me at least, makes beautiful beer. i know others have been critical of the lack of carbonation, massive still body, and the price tag on this beer, which is certainly not for everyone, but i found it positively delightful. would i buy it? maybe. but i am overjoyed that i got to sample this, and honestly, a sample is all you really need with this strength and intensity of flavors. this proves that sam adams still makes some of the most far out beer in the world, even if the flagship brands are super safe.","StonedTrippin","Jan 13, 2014"

This beer is amazing and im so glad I got to try it , the sweetness is spot on, heavy oak flavors, nice plum, cherry, and other dark fruits.

Every once in a while, I'll go for a Dogfish 120, but Utopias is way beyond that. What a fantastic brew -- one of the best ever! But at such a cost. Not worth it to me. That's a flaw in the Beer Advocate rating system. Obviously it should factor in the cost, but it doesn't. Yeah, I'd like to drink this every day, but not if I had to pay for it!","paultierney1","Jun 27, 2013"

The beer has a very strong maple syrup smell that mixes with hints of oak barrel and vanilla. Other notes that make a strong appearance is toffee with a bit of the alcohol smell as well as tiny notes of cherry. The smell is interesting in that the smells are, at best, balance and, at worst,, complementing each other very well. The taste is strong and sweet with maple syrup dominating the tongue. The beer has a cherry flavor and very noticeable funk from their KMF line. The taste also has hints of vanilla as well as bits of alcohol. The 2013 edition definitely has a tartier taste than the 2012 edition. The aftertaste is very sweet and sugary. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth bordering on slick but with body. No carbonation but definitely heavy. The beer has a tiny bit of alcohol burn at the beginning but goes out towards the end. Overall, a fantastic beer and one that I will continue to look out for every year.","HattedClassic","Apr 07, 2013"

It’s meant to be enjoyed at room temperature and in small, savory sips. This batch has very complex flavors. I’ve read that oxidation is part of the appeal of this beer; in other words you open the bottle, screw the cap back on when done and leave it be (like most liquors). Since I can’t personally speak to how this may taste a year from now, I would risk a guess that it will be as equally tasty as it is from a recently opened bottle. If given the chance to try it (or any of the previous batches) you’ll definitely want to add it to your “tried beers” list.","tastymug","Mar 14, 2013"

What mars the experience to me is the jarring astringent bite from the alcohol, which is more akin to sipping a whiskey neat. The complexity and flavors are there, it's just not as easy to sip as it could be, maybe 27% has something to do with it.

There is no hint of beer in the flavor, as it tastes like a very smooth cognac. If you asked 1000 people (non beer geeks) to taste it, I doubt anyone would say it was a beer. It is certainly worth it to split the cost with some friends, but I can buy a few great bottles of single malt scotch and a bottle of Bourbon for less money.","potownbill","Jan 25, 2013"

The various barrels work really well together, presenting an up front flavor which is more like a fine spirit than a beer. The finish, however, is pure malty delciousness, reminding you that you are drinking a beer. I very much recommend seeking out a pour, but be warned - the server at ChurchKey said it lasts 3-4 weeks after opening before succumbing to noticeable oxidation, so purchasing a whole bottle is probably not a good idea unless you have several friends to share it with.","kdb150","Jan 16, 2013"

Would love to get a longer appreciation for this, but i guess thats what the multiple servings are for. To be consumed like a fine, very expensive wine, with each sip being gentle, small, with a long drawn out swallow. Very savoring. This is a once in a lifetime purchase for me. At $300 a bottle was it worth it? only for self satisfactor sake. The bottle is quite the appeal and makes for a good show piece. Best split with friends or experienced by the glass at an establishment if you want to experience this first hand. 27% abv was not as boozy as one would think, ive had beers 10% that seemed more potent then this, just take it easy with small mangable sips, to much and that 27% will smack some sense into you.","beerthulhu","Jan 08, 2013"

It smells and looks similar to a port with dark brown cognac like features and tastes like one, unfortunately a bad one. Very heated in the mouth and all sorts of flavors but they are subdued by the bad alcohol taste. I had the 2009 earlier this year and it was much better thn the 10th Anniv. IMO you are much better off buying a $30 Warres Port if you are looking for this taste. I was very much looking forward to this one with all the hype it had around and since I very much liked the 2009 but this one was just a diasppoinment unfortunately.","krl2112","Dec 20, 2012"

No carbonation; totally still. Smell was ripe with rum barrels and booze. Taste was intense and powerful. Rum, port, caramel, raisins, toffee, sugar cane all came to mind. Mouthfeel was silky smooth and luscious like a nice cognac. This "beer" really stretched the definition of what beer is, even even though it was high priced, it was worth it.

Nose is ultra starchy and rice wine like specifically huangjiu or yellow alcohol, Chinese rice wine. It’s tough to describe but heavy red bean starch, sweet toffee, not as much smoke and rice character as huangjiu and more savory soy and saltwater. As it opens up/decants you are rewarded with cinnamon and amaretto. Still, enormous umami character like porcini mushroom and beef bouillon. Interesting combo. Taste is sour lemon up front with mild alcohol heat ending with big starchiness and more lemon. Mild oxidized character. Interesting. Alcohol heat is not an issue. Palate seems decently viscous. Hard to compare to other barleywines as this is more like brandy and rice wine blended. I’m very grateful for the sample, but I think it is safe to say I would not spend $100 on a bottle...though you get to savor this over a long period like Scotch so maybe it is worth it.","tarheels86","Nov 20, 2012"

Maple, almond, oak, cherry, chocolate, booze, pecans, caramel and molasses. It is syrupy, sticky, sweet, very hot. It is definitely a lot different than a beer.

They were in the mix of barrels for this 2011 edition, and they do shine beautifully. Memories of a Cardenal Mendoza, so this is something that may appeal to anyone keen on that sweet complex brandy range, it has some of that Carlos I and Duque de Alba range but the final sweet complexity puts it closer to Cardenal Mendoza than anything else I've ever tasted. If one can afford it, at the suggested retail prize, this is a delight to have and share with people either intrigued by the limits of beer, or this complex Brandy, Cognac, solera blends… Pushing the price at the retail point I guess might develop part of the legend but hurts the accessibility to something that is already pretty pricey. At this price range, if I can afford it then, I'd love to have access to a bottle of the next vintage… in 2013? Thanks Luke, and Manning for making this possible.","Daniellobo","Jul 13, 2012"

Incredible. Again a layer of alcohol veils everything just a bit on the palate, but tofee, nuts, oak, butterscotch, brandy, cognac, brown sugar and some sweet chocolate. Sweet and extremely 'desserty' - dense body with a lingering flavour. Thick, alcoholic but a great warmth in the finish. The smoothness at which the alcohol is applied is fantastic.

The taste has amazingly very little alcohol perception! Dark fruit and port qualities dominate the flavor, figs, plums, raisins, oak, bourbon and a touch of alcohol.

The aroma is a ton of dark fruit from the start - a huge dose of prunes and raisins. There is a caramelly sweetness that reminds of candied raisins and the malt is laughing and dancing in the background. One can also find sour cherries and a huge alcohol burn. This tastes like a million things. The flaovr is extremely sweet up front like glazed prunes and cherries mixed with fresh caramel and cream with a dash of vanilla. The malt is also quite present, adding layers of flavor and even roast and a dash of coffee if you really search. The mouthfeel is really unique - creamy and thick, coating the mouth, along with a burn from the alcohol, but you don’t taste so much as feel it. This is awesome stuff!","drowland","Feb 05, 2012"

Team up with your buddies, split it 10 ways, I don't care what you do. Just make sure you get your hands on a 2 oz. pour of Utopias while you are still a beer fanatic. It is unlike anything I have ever had before. It truly is a port, but man is it lip-smackingly tasty. It definitely drinks boozy, but somehow maintains a pleasantness and smoothness that is unbelievable. If you have the budget, grab this one.

In the taste, concentrated Munich malts, chocolates, vanilla, dry oak, generic fruits, bourbon, sherry, brown sugar, alcohol, toffee, maple, candy, and butterscotch. Mouth-feel is slick, chewy, right around medium bodied but no carbonation. Like a fine liquor. Overall, Utopias is a beast of a beer, and pushes the boundaries of what beer really is and can be. I recommend trying this, but a whole bottle would last me a long long time. Boston Beer Company can consider this one a success and a brew worthy of a great celebration.

More like an aperitif or a desert wine. Too sweet and boost overall to be enjoyed often or even a few times a year to be honest and boost overall.

There is so much going on in the nose, smells so much like cognac with lots of vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee with hints of maple. The balance that is obtained in this beer even with the ABV and the amount of blending and aging is just fantastic. The tiniest of tiny sips explodes on the tongue with so much flavor. This beer is nothing short of spectacular. The smell and taste completely take over your senses. I was lucky to get a sizable portion for sampling.

The beer is hot and is a great sipper, but it really reminds me of a bottle of Lost Abbey Deliverance, but stronger. Not to detract from the quality of the beer, but I really feel like the price-to-enjoyment ratio just does not pan out on this one for me personally. Good shit though.","peacebone116","Oct 03, 2011"

3.96,-11.2,3.5,5,4,2.5,3.5,"D/O: At first encounter this beer exhibits a convulsion-inducing quality that reminds of the way that an actor takes a stiff drink. Its early flavors overwhelm the senses while remaining true to the smell. It is able to lift the bourbon and other spirits from the wood successfully, yet their presence is short-lived. The latter two acts are surprisingly vacant--not by the standards of normal beer, but in this case compared to the beginning. Utopias may be the poster-child of extreme beer in America, possibly in need of a new style that is the plank-owner of.","beagle75","Sep 19, 2011"

Brandy and vanilla comes through as well. A little bit of maple. The alcohol is certainly present, but surprisingly restrained given the ABV and the amount present on the nose. Full bodied. No carbonation. Drinks similar to something like a cognac, but the beer qualities are certainly there. Unique and enjoyable. I'm glad to have tried it.","jethrodium","Jul 15, 2011"

It was dark so hard to see, but seemed like a deep dark murky brown or purple in the little light I had to work with. The smell was rich syrupy caramel. The taste followed the nose fairly sweet, but extremely drinkable. I only had a very small sample but this went down smooth and warmed me up immediately on a tiny sip as I battled the weather at that ungodly hour of the morning. A beer like this is unique and surprisingly together...the fact that you can drink it and reseal it and it will still last for years makes it really an anamoly, but it works.","cosmicevan","Jul 04, 2011"
4.48,0.4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: This is really a unique and special "beer." I put beer in quotes for the obvious reasons that it just isn't like any other beer. It lacks carbonation and that's weird to be drinking a beer that doesn't have carbonation but the overall complexity contained within that copper-kettle bottle is one of the biggest reasons to go find this beer.","suspect","Jun 28, 2011"
4.47,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Massive thanks goes out to cmrillo who shared this one with the group at the "Evening Wood" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo as well! 2005 Vintage (OH SNAP!)! Bottle #8458! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured ruby red with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, alcohol (duh), and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, BIG alcohol (no shocker here), peat, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this brew was excellent. I'm really glad I finally got the opportunity to give this one a shot. I thought this was going to kill me on the alcohol, but Sam Adams did a fantastic job on making it as sweet as possible to cut back on the burn and overwhelming alcohol flavor you get in other high ABV brews. Really enjoyed getting the chance to try this one. This one only came out during the tasting for one of two reasons I think... Either A) Rillo was really drunk or B) I mentioned to him that I had never tried Utopias before. Either were possible at this point honestly. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I got the chance and I am seriously debating on buying a bottle for myself in the future based on this experience dispite the high price.","thagr81us","Jun 28, 2011"

4.36,-2.2,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a dark caramel color and is of course flat so it has no head or lacing, but some nice legs form as the liquid is swirled due to the high alcohol content. The nose is full vanilla, caramel and hot alcohol vapor. I also get notes of black figs and dates. The flavor has all of these flavors plus notes of red grapes, dark cherries, sweet brown sugar, woody oak, and maybe a hint of toffee, bread crust and other sweet sugary fruits. There is a nutty quality with flavors that remind me of ground walnuts. The finish is very sweet and it coasts my mouth in syrupy sugar. The body and mouthfeel are thick and heavy and not as hot as the nose suggests. I wish this beer was more affordable so I could drink it more often, but I can definitely taste the quality.

At 40-50 bucks a bottle this would be outstanding beer, but 170 a bottle makes this simply an incredibly underwhelming experience. I really hate myself for taking this feeling, but beer has to be graded as beer, and frankly this isn’t beer by any normal measure. I’m not sure what color something like this should be or how to score the appearance as it has no comparison. I’m not sure how to score the mouth feel as this is only 27% but the alcohol kicks nearly as well as some smoother bourbons. I’m glad to have tried this, and I’ll enjoy the rest of this bottle. I do hope this ages well open as I can see some rather good changes to come in time.","bobhits","May 22, 2011"

The major change I've noticed is that the smell of maple is much stronger now than it was when it was new. The flavor is also along the same lines. The maple is really coming through now, it's almost like I should put it on pancakes or something. For a beer that's over 20% abv it's very smooth. There isn't much of an alcohol burn.

There is no head or lacing, but it is supposed to be still so I can't fault the beer for that. I don't know how to judge appearance on this, it would be like judging appearing on congac... they all look basically the same to me. On the smell, alcohol first seems to be there, but then I get vanilla and strong caramel and maple. This reminds me a bit of the Remy Martin XO congac. Smooth mouthfeel, as you'd expect with no carbonation. A little bit boozy, but this was really delicious. Glad I got to try it.","kwjd","Feb 10, 2011"

Dry finish with a heavy alcohol burn, very smooth and silky as it goes down which makes it more of a beer than a spirit to me. This is a very slow sipper. 4 ounces took me over an hour, but it was well worth it. Glad I saved this bottle, and still have another to save for many more years.

There may have been nuts or caramel tones as well to the aroma, but the alcohol made it rather hard to detect. The taste however strongly resembled that of maple syrup, partially due to the beverages consistence and mostly to do with the maple flavor. There are some toffee and hazelnut notes as well along with fruit characteristics like cherry syrup. This is a very viscous brew, but it is as advertised and compliments the style quite well. It actually doesn't really burn at all for something of such high ABV, making it very drinkable for a sipping liquor.

This was combined with a balancing refined bitterness all in perfect harmony, while finishing with a satisfying dose of warming, but not burning alcohol. At 27% alcohol by volume, this deceptively strong beer is better compared to a premium Brandy or exquisite Sherry as opposed to any beer that I have every known. Even though this beer was aged in Scotch, Cognac and Port barrels, it did not have the overpowering raisin or maple character found in the Triple Bocks. Everything about the Utopias equated to balance and perfect harmony.

The aroma is awesome after a minute or two to let it open up. It smells very sweet, like maple syrup with a vanilla quality to it. The taste surprised me because of a few things. Firstly, the heat is prevalent as would be expected but not as much as you would think. It is covered very well by the rich, sweetness. The second thing that surprised me was the lack of bite. I expected a much bigger bite but that is not to say I was disappointed, just pleased by in different ways. It had a silky, vanilla-oak finish that sticks with you quite a while after each drink. There is no carbonation whatsoever which was expected for an after-dinner type beer that is to be served at room temperature. In truth, even though it is brewed as a beer, it has much more in common with a nice cognac.

The body is thick and smooth, even without carbonation the feel is delightful. High in alcohol, but scrumptious to have sitting in the mouth.

In some cases it's not classified as beer because of it's fermenting methods, and ABV Levels. Good taste, very good for sipping on.

Swirl the glass gently and it sticks to the sides like a viscous, syrup; this stuff is THICK! There's no carbonation and no lacing. Smells of maple, cinnamon, whiskey, bourban, vanilla. Perhaps a slight hint of butter? (very, very faint, though.) The taste is, well...good gawd, is this really beer? I sip this and think I'm drinking a fine cognac, it doesn't taste like beer, it tastes like a cordial. Picking up nuances of vanilla, cinnamon, maple, massive amounts bourban, sherry, and whiskey. In fact, there's so many different layers of complexity that I can't even detect them all. There's a huge burning sensation in the throat for an extended period of time after the sip. The texture is amazingly velvety smooth on the tongue. This is more of a cognac than a beer and I'm blown away by this beer, it's so incredible, different, and pushes the envelope to such extreme measure that the line between liquor and beer has now been fogged. I'm fortunate to have gotten a bottle of this through a family connection, I hope to experience this again before I die! The big down side is because of the 50 barrel quantity, it's darn hard to find and when you do, who can really afford it? My father in law works for Sam Adams so I'm blessed.

No carbonation but I'll be damned if it doesn't leave legs on the glass like a fine wine. Lots of greasy ones. It smells of alcohol (makes it hard to smell, really), prunes, and honey. Tastes of molasses, maple syrup, prunes, honey, vanilla, and oranges with a peppery and strong warming alcohol finish. It has an oak-like aftertaste and long after the fact it tastes like sherry. Maybe it just takes me a while to identify that. The mouthfeel is syrupy but slippery, absolutely flat. It coats your tongue and seems to be settling in to stay like an unemployed in-law. I can't call it drinkable, really, but then again its not that you don't like it, its just that its very clear that a small amount is all you need or want in a session.

First off, the bottle is beautiful- I love the copper sheathing. The pour itselff looks like a cognac or something, but slightly more viscous. No head at all, but excellent clarity and it sticks to the glass. The aromas are not at all beer like. Instead I get maple sweetened brandy, but nicely balanced and not too sweet. The taste is even nicer, for what it is. Long brandy like heat, but fairly smooth and tempered somewhat by clean-tasting relatively dry maple syrup flavors, and some vinous qualities.

Overall this was just about perfect - one of the best alcoholic beverages of any sort that I've tried. It was very simple at first, but the more you thought about it, the more complex it became.

Poured out with no carbonation, but still looked nice in the Utopias snifter. The color was of a deep copper. The taste was smooth in comparison to ports and cognacs. It definitely can't be compared to most other beers. There are notes of oak, burnt caramel, vanilla, and fruits; but none of them overwhelm eachother. Part of the enjoyment of this beer probably comes from the experience of drinking a beer that is more expensive than a lot of fine wines and spirits. Athough it is smooth, this beer is definitely a sipper. Two ounces is just enough to make each tasting special. If you can find a bottle, or a bar that will sell it by 2 ounce shots, taste it.

I poured a 1 oz. sample into my Utopias glass that came "free" with the purchase of the bottle. Color is a clear burnt orange with hints of amber and ruby. As it is flat, there is no head. Swirling reveals legs on the side of the glass as you get with fine wines and cognacs. Swirling also exposes the intense aromas of vanilla, maple, and brown sugar. These come out in the flavor as well, with an intense sweetness and a warming alcohol sense as it goes down. Given the sweetness, strength, and most importantly the cost, I would not want to drink more than 1 of these in a given evening, which is why I gave a low score for drinkability. Overall, its a nice novelty but not really what I look for in an alcoholic beverage, and the cost is staggeringly high at $150 per 25 oz. bottle (roughly $6 per once).","TheBCrew","Jan 11, 2008"

Heavily bourbon, vanilla, heavy fruits, maybe some oak in there if i can sort it from the bourbon, very intoxicating, delicious. Taste is on the verge of overpowering, can't imagine going more than a snifter full of it. Mirroring aroma, heavy on the bourbon, really more like hard alcohol than beer, complex and fierce, but refined in every sense of the word, smooth and warm in the mouth.

Anyway, I was lucky enough to come across a bottle of this stuff for free! Oh, but it was no accident by the way. So, it poured a nice copper with no head (not carbonated) smelled and tasted at first like a cross between tawny port and single barrel Bourbon. Repeated tastings narrowed it down to a monster strength J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, or a 10 year tawny, but with more burn. I shared this out with five other friends. We had all we wanted, and dumped the rest out the window (not kidding - it was free, and we had our fill). It tasted marvelous for a beer, but just standard for a good tawny port I bought for a quarter of what this thing originally retailed for. Why go out of your way to pay 120 bucks for something that tastes like a good 35 dollar bottle of port? Oh, because it was free (for me) that's why.

Tastewise it is surprisingly sweet, aka, no alcohol burn, which is why I was able to drink so many samples ;-) A very smooth drinking beer, there's a lot of different angles of sweetness here: maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, even fruit sweetness from raisins.
