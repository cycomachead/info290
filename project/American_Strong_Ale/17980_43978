4.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Got this from a great friend who lives in Vermont!  Bottle 845 of 1500.  Beautiful, slightly hazy dark mahogany pour with a two finger creamy beige head with decent retention and great lacing.  The nose is incredible with huge maple notes along with hints of brown sugar, caramel, brown bread, molasses, vanilla, and toffee.  The taste is incredibly rich with the maple once again the star.  Hints of raisins were a surprise, complemented nicely with sweet brown bread, oak, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, booze, and just a touch of chocolate.  The mouthfeel  is thick and syrupy with subtle creaminess, and a warming, somewhat cloying finish.  Overall, while this is borderline too sweet, it's so full of flavor, and it's got just enough balance to compensate for any faults.  Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Sep 29, 2014"

Taste is much the same with malt, maple, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice smell, but the flavors are slightly oxidized at this point.","UCLABrewN84","May 21, 2014"
4.41,0.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The beer pours a dark hazy amber (no chunks of yeast) with a thin halo of white head around the perimeter. The nose is sweet (unexpected notes of lactose-like dairy sweetness?), distinct maple and yeast, minimal alcohol, no bitterness. The taste is maple forward (as hoped) with a hint of fruit and yeast, and a slight bitterness in the finish (more woody than hoppy). The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly syrupy (some carbonation, generous sap sweetness), but not chewy, has smooth maple goodness, masked alcohol, and a slightly dry bitterness in the finish. This beer is fantastic to drink, especially if you're a maple fan, but I'll have trouble justifying the price again in the future.","ThePorterSorter","May 16, 2014"

This is truly one of the most unique beers in existence. Pours a deep bronzed amber color, not really hazy, but "glossy," if that makes sense...like looking through a thick piece of colored glass. A small yellow-tan head sinks to a ringlet and a swirl leaves some legs on the glass. Rich, dark sugars in the aroma, caramel and maple sap, woody and slightly boozy. Luscious taste reflects the nose, caramel, maple, some vanilla sweetness, some woodiness, and a stiff boozy kick, but that component melds well with the rest of the flavors, giving a sensation of a maple liqueur more than any other kind of booze. Medium-full body, mouthfeel is smooth and slick, syrupy, and can be on the hot side. Previous versions I've had have been a bit more hot with booze, but this particular bottle--aged only a few months after I bought it--was really nice and smooth, and the alcohol heat was toned down. I seriously could've easily conquered this bottle by myself with no problem. The price tags on these bottles are on the higher side, but it's understandable considering the recipe, and it's also worth every penny.","Rifugium","Jan 23, 2014"

Leaves back light spotty lace that slowly drips down the sides. The aroma is SWEET! I’m talking maple syrup, brown sugar, caramel, sugary dough and fruit. I’m pleased to find that is isn’t cloying in the nose however, as the complexity keeps things very interesting. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, very sugary on the palate but with more help from those fruity esters and some extra boozy sweetness from the ABV. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied and quite chewy on the tongue. This feels about 12% but doesn’t sting, as those aforementioned flavors eat up a lot of the booze presence here. I really liked this. I initially thought the sweetness was going to get to be too much at first but the overall complexity of this really grew on me the further I got into the glass.","Kegatron","Jan 23, 2013"

I have pure Vermont Maple Syrup pretty much every week and you can definitely tell that this was crafted with it. Pure Maple syrup is very sweet and sugary, but this beer had a nice balance of it that coupled well with the Belgian yeasts used. It was very sweet and sugary, but not overly so that it was unappetizing. It did have a tiny bit of heat to it, but I felt like it went well with the beer a nice slight maple liquor feel to it. Definitely a sipper, especially considering the price. I definitely recommend checking this out, but it's probably not something I would drink all the time.

Before tasting I know this will be the most heavily maple-flavored beer I’ve ever had and it sure is. Hard to call it beer, almost. Flavor of mildly boozy maple syrup. Not many other flavor notes discernible. Brown sugar, caramel maltiness, very faint floral hops which contribute a subtle bitterness. Thick, chewy, and slightly cloying, a bit sticky, quite sweet, totally unique. What can I say? I loved it. If you are a maple fan this is hands down the one beer you have to try.

Nose is caramel and maple, sappy and sticky, with light dark fruit and some traces of oak. Some alcohol heat, but not distracting. Syrupy body, low carbonation, sticky and dense on the palate. Raw maple and burnt sugar sweetness hits the front of the palate and persists throughout. Finishes dries out a little with light oak and pleasant warming alcohol. For such a big, unusual beer, this never veers to becoming cloying or too boozy. A novelty, but surprising well balanced and drinkable.","yourefragile","Feb 04, 2012"

4.22,-3.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Thanks to Thirstybird for generously sharing this brew. 500ml bottle - #353 of 374. Served in a chalice. Pours a hazy amber with a quarter inch, loose, khaki-colored head that dissipates into a skim. As to be expected, the nose has a huge maple syrup presence, but it's not overly cloying. There's also a bit of citrus and a light boozy quality somewhat characteristic of a cordial. Taste consistent with nose - not quite as sweet as maple candy, but it's really quite sweet nonetheless. A subtle citrus acidity cuts the flavor a trace. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an easy carbonation, a slight acidity and a texture that falls just short of oily. This is really an interesting beer; however, it could definitely be bottled in a 7.5oz format similar to what was done with the Bourbon Barrel Aged Fayston Maple Imperial. We split this amongst three and had to revisit it between other offerings. That said, this beer is at its best as it warms to room temperature.

It was sweet enough to let you know what the ingredients were, but not so overbearing that you couldnt drink it.

At the session, Sean Lawson gave out samples of his Maple Tripple Ale which he stated was brewed with 100% pure maple sap. The beer sample was paired with a gorgonzola cheese. The beer was an amber color and had a strong aroma of maple which overpowered any other scent coming from the beer. The alcohol was well-hidden with this beer. The beer was a bit thick to the taste and was sweet, but not as sweet as the strong aroma of maple would imply. The taste was very unique and very good. It is quite the beer treat and I highly recommend trying it if given the opportunity.","Chincino","0"

Nicely balanced between sweet & dry; hops are very low-key. Flavor is all maple & wood, with toffee & caramel notes. Not astringently dry like many sap beers. Finish is long and of maple candy - but not sweet, thankfully. As with many sap & maple beers, there can be a flavor of wood that imitates maple wood aroma - but very subtle.
