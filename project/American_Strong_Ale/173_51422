A case where barrel aging doesn't help the beer and perhaps takes away some of its finest nuances. The original Fred was the top of my list tasting these in succession. Tasting separately or between/behind/in front of other beers...who knows - may change the impression, but Fred - FftW, BFftW progression took a bit away each time (and I don't believe it to be from reduced coherency despite the 10%, 10%, 12% strengths of these beers. Regular Fred was supremely balanced and this almost by default had to diminish from there. All are great beers, but this BFftW is the least balanced and least flawless/most flawed of the bunch. Worthy of a sample for sure, but the original Fred, for me, is the way to go in the future...rarity doesn't pay off in this series.","portia99","Apr 04, 2014"

Besides the fact that this bottle was completely flat, the bourbon barrel aging is too dominant, basically whiping the base beer off the planet. More nuanced barrel aging would allow the beauty that is Fred play a roll in the flavor profile a little more, and some carbonation would help the whole experience further. Glad to have tried this, and I'll wait and hope future batches turn out better.","Jeffo","Feb 08, 2013"

3.95,-3.4,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Prying the cap off gave a tiny hiss, indicative of the practically non-existent carbonation I expected. Poured into a HotD stemmed taster, a murky burnt orange color, with no head, and extremely low carbonation, with the tiniest of collars around the rim of the glass, which left microscopic strands of lacing. An interesting aroma, raisins, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, dried orange peel. A lot going on in the taste as well, but largely reflected the aroma: chewy caramel and brown sugar, raisin, heavily oaked bourbon still apparent even after years of mellowing, vanilla and dried citrus zest, with a candy-like sweetness. I'd imagine this was much boozier fresh, but the bourbon and overall higher ABV was pretty well-integrated at this point. Body was closing in on full, mouthfeel was slick, but the practically lifeless carb sort of detracted from the mouthfeel. I always know HotD brews are going to be low carb, but I still always wish there was just a bit more in there to liven up the mouthfeel. Still a good brew overall, but with a complexity in the flavor that might come off as messy to some.","Rifugium","Jan 25, 2013"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, candi sugar, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, candi sugar, vanilla, sweet alcohol, wood, and sweet candy. It had a medium feel on the palate with very little carbonation (made it feel much thicker). Overall this was a fairly good brew. This one really didn’t show its true ABV due to all the sweetness going on, but you could definitely tell this one was a heavy-hitter. The lack of carbonation really hurt this one in my opinion as it made it VERY thick feeling and not a huge treat for the palate compared to the other components going on here.

2.44,-40.3,1,2,3.5,1,2,"Picked up this bottle last week at Hi Times. Pours pond water flat. Like a juice. Very disappointing to see this is devoid of any carbonation. The label should have provided a warning. Smell is dominated by oxidation. Behind that are layers of bourbon, vanilla and brown sugar. But the nose is really dominated by the smell of a beer that has not aged well in spite of this being a new release. Taste is slightly more balanced but this beer still tastes like a horribly aged, improperly cellared brew. Again, notes of bourbon, brown sugar and vanilla are present as well. Body is fairly thick and entirely uncarbonated. Overall this is an extremely disappointing beer. Regular Fred and FFTW are so much better.","waltonc","Dec 27, 2011"

Flavor is a bit more integrated with a touch less tannin. Medium body with low carbonation. Pretty good, but the bourbon takes over the base beer and is a bit too one-dimensional.","Thorpe429","Dec 18, 2011"
4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer is a murky copper/brown/orange hue with virtually no head. The aroma brings bourbon, oak, subtle fruit and spice. Good flavor, slightly tannic.

Overall, very good. Something I would definitely enjoy having again.","Huhzubendah","Dec 18, 2011"

Booze and bourbon dominate the aroma with vanilla, honey, clove, brown sugar. Nearly still body, silky smooth and thick, with a sticky, dry finish. Flavor is syrupy and sweet, following the nose but more bourbon, oak, tobacco and vanilla. Enjoyed regular Fred much more.","yourefragile","Dec 17, 2011"

4.09,0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,"Perhaps the biggest let down in this brew is it's drop dead lack of carbonation. It is full bodied and smooth in the feel. It is thick enough but carries enough alcohol inclusion that it is slick and does not coat the inside of the mouth. While being still does not fully distract from the experience, just the slightest amount of carbonation would have taken this brew into a holy realm... really. It is certainly worth the effort if you get a chance, solid deep brew here.","stakem","Dec 11, 2011"

I have absolutely loved all the other HotD beers I have tried and taste-wise this is no exception. Call me small-minded, but I can't get over the lack of bubbles.

That being said, even at the $7.50 price per 12 ounce pour in the tasting room I would say that this is worth every penny. Nobody makes beer exactly like Alan Sprints. His beers are truly world class and deserve the respect they receive. Unique, original, and delicious, I will be buying bottles of this for further development if given the opportunity.","hopsbreath","Aug 02, 2009"
