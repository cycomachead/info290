3.36,0.6,4,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"A wit infused with braggot, this brew pours a honey gold color with a white head. Aroma of hibiscus tea, honey, pepper, spice and herb. In the flavor, very herbal and earthy, the lavender really adds a depth to the beer and undeniable floral qualities. For a herbed/spiced Saison, this one is pretty enjoyable. Everything is in balance and its pretty well rounded. Hides the 8% really well. If this were bottled, I would set a few down for a few years to see what happens. Agreeable brew.","Stinkypuss","0"
