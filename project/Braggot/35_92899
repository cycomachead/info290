The brew pours out a cloudy amber color with nice white head. I'm going to say this brew is unfiltered. The smell is rich with sweetness and grains. There is a hit of spices in the smell of this brew. The taste is sweet like honey. There is also some grains and malts at the end. Honey Queen goes down smooth with no bad after taste.  This brew has a nice balance to it ,there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Samuel Adams did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again, it was better than what I was expecting. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Oct 19, 2014"

3.75,4.7,,,,,,"Inquiring into the new, as-yet-unmarked tap at the bar, I was told it was a mead beer.  I ordered it forthwith, knowing too well how rare braggots are at bars.  This one pours a clear golden brass topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises flowers, chamomile, light nutmeg, sweet cereal grains, light dried honey, and sweet white wine grapes.  The taste brings in more of the same, the flowers, honey, chamomile, and grapes shining through and combining fairly well.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly syrupy feel.  Overall, a rather enjoyable braggot, one of the better "experimental" beers Sam Adams has put out in recent memory.","TMoney2591","Aug 14, 2014"

3.88,8.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours fairly crystal clear bright gold color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, tangerine, pineapple, pear, orange peel, honey, bread, chamomile, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of honey, pale malt, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, tangerine, pineapple, pear, orange peel, honey, bread, chamomile, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, tangerine, pineapple, pear, citrus peel, honey, bread, chamomile, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of honey, pale malt, and spice flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice braggot style. All around good complexity and balance of honey, pale malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 04, 2014"

The story on how the beer style created also intrigued me. The first thing that stood out to me was the aftertaste, which reminded me of tart tasting mixture. This beer had some caramel i believe, but the citric and honey overpower the smell of it. I enjoyed the beer, but it was not one i would try again.

3.73,4.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a medium golden (honey?) amber with a one finger white head with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of mead, floral and herbal spicing; mildly tea-like and vinous. Flavor starts with quite sweet floral and apple juice but dries out a bit to exhibit mead-like character, finishing estery and sweet with floral notes and at last, a lingering light honey taste that is mild enough to be quite pleasant. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A style with few European examples to compare and possibly few historically accurate ones in any case. I've had only one Danish braggot and a domestic one made with prickly pear, so I can only guess to compare this in style. It is certainly what I would expect from a honey beer, sweet and floral. It is much sweeter than most mead, but I did enjoy the pure honey flavor in the finish, which is usually lost in mead. Good floral notes, but it seemed to skate on the edge of cloying sweetness. Also slightly tame, like many Boston Beer offerings. An enjoyable honey, fruit and floral ale that left me wishing I could go back a few centuries to taste the real thing. Not a bad interpretation of a rare style.","LiquidAmber","Jun 18, 2014"

3.56,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a decent example of a Braggot, it had some nice aspects and I liked the different flavors that honey imparted especially the honey dew and white grape flavors, but I thought the honey pretty much took over and along with the chamomile it made it hard to pick up any flavors that the base beer imparted. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not too cloying, a little creamy, not too crisp, not too filling, but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think the chamomile would start to wear on me after one glass, so I think that would be my limit, but I think it makes for a decent summertime beer. What I like the most about this beer was the fruity and floral flavors and aromas that the honey imparted, they were nice and little unique. What I liked the least about this beer was the chamomile, I don't think it really added anything thing to this beer and I think it held this beer back from being as good as it could be and I also I wish it just had better balance and that the beer base was more noticeable. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but it isn't something that I could see myself getting again and I might recommend it if you really like braggots, but I don't think the average Craft beer drinker would really dig it. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it wasn't bad, but I think it was a little rough around the edges and it could use a little work and some balancing out. This isn't my favorite Braggot or my favorite beer from Samuel Adams. It's nice to see Sam Adams tackle a style like this and I'm glad they tried it, but I think with a little work it could be a much better beer. I appreciate the effort but i think this one needs a little work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jun 15, 2014"

Light and refreshing, not overwhelmingly sweet considering the amount of honey, worth trying. It's enough to make me pursue other braggots.","Cylinsier","Mar 16, 2014"

Pale malt, wheat, bread, honey, grassy hops form the aroma. On the palate, the honey stands through the center. It's dry and a little sweet as it sticks around after the swallow. The sweetness is strong (this is a honey beer), but it isn't over the top. Bitterness at the end does much to provide balance.","BeardedBoffin","Jul 07, 2013"
