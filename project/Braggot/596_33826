4,-0.2,,,,,,"Decent head which crests over a finger, mostly larger bubbles so doesn’t persist that long, pleasingly orangish tan color, the lacing forms thick streaks, however, these too aren’t long for this world. Rich amber red color, bright shine to it, lots of large and swiftly moving bubbles. Big, brash nose of honey, candied orange peel, cocoa and caramel, sweet is what it does best, lighter dough to processed grains presence, apple, pear, peach to fig fruit scents, textural thickness has it glued to your nostrils for some time. Full-bodied, the carbonation is working overtime but not going to match the layered power and heaviness it presents. More mineral to metallic notes as well as grass and bread crust, still it remains all about the honey. The orange citrus expands into white grapefruit. The caramel verges onto butterscotch syrup and vanilla pudding. There is a burnt touch, like caramelized brown sugar. The fruit lacks clarity, lump of peach, apricot and fig. At the very end you get a fizzy tickle. Does come off as boozy, you feel the alcohol. A very sweet in style beer that likely is best utilized as a dessert beverage or to counter a very spicy and heavy main course dish.","farrago","Jul 31, 2014"
4.35,8.5,,,,,,"Pours a hazy dark amber body with a white head. Smells malty, honey, sweet cane sugar, molasses, dark fruits. Taste is honey, spice, sweet toffee, molasses, roasty on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium heavy, rich body. Overall a very enjoyable beer, a great representation of the style.","gcamparone","Jul 05, 2014"

3.74,-6.7,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, golden-amber coloring with only a ring of white film on the surface. Aromas of honey sweetness, dark and rich, with some fruity highlights like cider. Subtle nutmeg sweetness on the nose, too. Flavors are rich and toasty, with a honey and toffee sweet backbone. Nutmeg spicing and subtle apple sweetness brings a hot cider feel to the palate, and there are some peppery hops characteristics towards the end of the palate that help clean up. Smooth, mid-bodied with a roasty and sweet aftertaste. The finish is light, slightly frothy, with a hops bitterness at the end.","GarthDanielson","Mar 23, 2013"

3.06,-23.7,3.5,3,3,3.25,3,"Hazy, burnt orange pour, with a white collar of bubbles. Sweet, malty aroma, light stone fruits, and herbal notes. Taste was pretty similar, caramel malts, sweet corn, honeysuckle, indistinct stone fruit, vegetal, stiff with dry booze. Yep, this was essentially a glorified malt liquor. Mouthfeel was pretty thinned out, about light-medium in body. Not much distinctiveness or flavor. Not something I'd go for again.","Rifugium","0"

Served in a snifter, it was a dark brown, with a small head and some nice lacing. It had a sweet, dark fruity aroma. A sweet honey taste, with some hops, that just kept coming at you. Very assertive, but not in your face. A definite hit. Try it, by all means.","lordofthewiens","Beers"
