3.44,12.1,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not a bad mead/braggot, has a decent flavour profile, if the aroma were bolstered and the body didn't resemble carbonated fruit juice that would really improve the overall impression. The flavour of the honey and blueberries is actually surprisingly refreshing but overall the complete package could be improved, still I wouldn't say it was a bad representation of the style. Definitely pick up both on the honey and blueberry character, and they offer an interesting compliment to each other.","mick303","May 29, 2014"

1.12,-63.5,3,1,1,1,1,"Bottle: Poured a light blue-ish color mead which is very still. Aroma of gross blueberry notes with overly sweet ester. Taste is absolutely atrocious with no balance and gross notes with blueberries barely standing out. I don’t’ recall having tasted such a bad mead in my life. My buddy homebrewed mead is better than this crap.","Phyl21ca","May 01, 2014"

3.78,23.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"O: Hard to open cage and cork. The cage was of tough wire, much tougher than all Belgians I’ve had, and the cork broke off leaving me to use a knife to finish the job. When finally unplugged, an explosion of purple filled the room ceiling to shirt to floor. Hence the Quincy’s roll smell in the room on my wife’s entrance. However, really unique. My first in this style so I don't have any to compare it to, but look forward to trying more!","patre_tim","Apr 26, 2014"

3.42,11.4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. Trafalgar's Lanark Blueberry Mead didn't blow me away, but it's still one of the better products I've had from them. With no other braggots under my belt to compare this one to, this review is basically just a subjective opinion - so to boil it down, I'd say this one is worth at least one try if you're a fruit wine fan, or otherwise curious. The price is fine if you compare it to a similar volume of wine. Something more suited to a hot summer day than a rainy April one, but an interesting diversion nonetheless, and one of the few things in the Trafalgar portfolio I'd be interested in trying again.","thehyperduck","Apr 15, 2014"

4.03,31.3,3,5,4,2.5,4,"Closer too wine than beer could probably only drink one or 2. Seams like it could be a great beer to pair food with if you have the knowledge of pairing. why does this make me type a novel to ruin the short and sweetness of it take my comment......","TheGreenBuddah","0"
