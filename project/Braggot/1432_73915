3.62,-5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I've been meaning to try some baklava, but have never been in the right place to do so... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, light cinnamon, honey, and light yellow cake. The taste brings in more of the same, along with candied orange peel, some mild dark fruits, and a lingering sense of vague tartness somewhere in the ether. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty solid flavored braggot. 'Nuff said, really.","TMoney2591","Jan 05, 2013"
3.18,-16.5,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Slightly brown tinted darker shade of orange. No head, no lacing. Aroma is spicy: Cinnamon and nutmeg with a lots a honey. Flavor is worse: honey, spice, greenish herbal off-quality with a slight sourness. Light bodied. Mild bitterness. Lighter bodied. No bitterness. Not very good.","Florida9","Jan 05, 2013"
2.95,-22.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a bright gold with minimal head and some lacing. Smell is features honey, molasses, mellow waves of vanilla and some bread. The taste is very sweet with plenty of honey and a moderate amount of tartness. The finish has some extra tartness and sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is heavy with mild carbonation. Overall, so sweet and hardly enjoyable.","homebrew311","Dec 28, 2012"

Mild cinnamon spice in the background. Flavor has more sweetness plus a bit of fruit and honey. Slight earthy-herbal note. Bit of spice. Medium body.

4.12,8.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Rich looking clear amber pour with almost no head. The nose is reminiscent of sweet white grapes with a touch of honey sweetness and flintstone vitamins (yes you read correctly). The taste is more potent with a forefront of tart white grapes/lemon, a slight nuttiness, and a honey finish. This beer is very well executed in my opinion boasting lots of fruit and spice, but lacks in the alcohol presence that I expected.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 23, 2012"

Lots of additional flavors thrown in which are quite well balanced and make for a roller coaster of tastes. I didn't get much in the way of walnuts but everything else was there in spades.","Dope","Jun 05, 2012"

The smell of the beer was a little different than expected, the lemon zest was in there for sure. I was hoping for more of a honey aroma. The taste of the beer was also not quite what I expected but it was still pretty good. The flavors of the lemon and spice worked well together. The mouthfeel of the beer had a good level of carbonation to it and was medium bodied. Overall this beer was pretty good, makes me want to check out Jackie-O's a little more.","Knapp85","Feb 05, 2012"

3.92,2.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Big thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one with me during the Halloween festivities at his house! Thanks buddy! Served from growler into a Bell's stemmed tulip. Poured red-orange with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, caramel, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, fruit, subtle dark chocolate, and honey. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I will be the first to admit that I do not usually go out of my way to drink Braggots, but this one wasn't that bad. It had a very nice sweetness going on that made it drinkable for myself. The dark chocolate aspect definitely balanced out the sweetness quite nicely on this one to make it just right.","thagr81us","Beers"
4.5,18.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"rich dark amber color that was somewhat hazy and cloudy. A nice head of white came up over the top and settled down into a thin veil that stayed on top throughout the session. The aroma was loaded with grains, nice light fruit notes, hints of honey and a light bit of alcohol. Nice sharp bite as I take my first taste, rich flavor here, more so then I have seen in the style before. Nice flavor of honey soaked oak that came across the tonge very quickly. Smooth, mellow carbonation really let the flavor explore the palate as light noted of fruit, peaches and nice touches of light grain and spice. Very intresting and very smooth with almost no hotness even with the very high alcohol in this one. Overall another really big winner from the guys up north","mikesgroove","0"
3.43,-10,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"O - I'm not a huge fan of this beer...not sure if I'm a fan of the style or what so I can't say it's a bad example of a Braggot. That said, I would probably skip if offered up and drink something else Brad has on tap.","Sean9689","Oct 16, 2011"
3.77,-1,3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"D - It's in the top 10 braggots I've had, but that isn't saying much.
