On my second sip, with perhaps my buds adjusted, it was obviously not something I was going to drain-pour as syrup. That said, it was still an interesting beer that reminds me a lot of a hopped-up hard cider in its opening sweetness and an overly sweet barley wine in its dark sugar ending.","cjgiant","Aug 05, 2014"

3.63,-6.4,3.5,4.25,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a dark, murky, amber brown, like honey muddled with mud and water. The beer pours with a thin ring of bubbles that fizzle away and appear almost soda-like in quality. The beer’s body is murky, like fresh honey. The other side of the glass is indiscernible through the haze, but some light does travel through the beer. It leaves a thin set of legs on the glass when it washes up against the sides. On the nose, the beer smells richly of fresh, wildflower honey. Sticky and rich on the nose, the honey muddles with thick caramel malts, similar to Long Trail’s Triple Bag. Maple syrup, honey, toffee, and even some chocolate fudge touch upon the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sticky sweet but a little too bitter, with a bit of a bite on the middle of the palate. Hot booze tingles as the beer travels down the throat, and the finish is a little dry for what I want with just a touch of boozy sweet. On the tongue, the beer is on the heavy side of medium, practically heavy, with a chewy, slightly rough mouthfeel and faint carbonation. The beer bites at the tongue, oddly enough, which takes away from the rich, honeyed flavors that the beer should possess. It does, however, gel on the back of the tongue with some syrupy goodness. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet caramel barley, which turns into fiery alcohol with some interesting spice character and a touch of woodiness on the middle of the palate. The finish is hot and cloying with fusel notes. Touches of stone fruit and raisins can briefly be felt on the tongue, but really this beer is all about the hot booze on the finish. The aftertaste finally brings hints of sticky sweet honey to the tongue, where it creates a pool of saliva. As the beer warms it mellows some of its rougher edges, but still hits the palate with too much booze and not enough honey character. Overall, this beer is lacking in sweet, soft honey flavors that I want from it. I want a sticky thick beer but this just doesn’t quite deliver for me. The smell is rich with honey character but I get none in the taste. I suspect that with time in a cellar, this beer will open up into a rich and unique dessert beer, but it’s a bit of a hot mess fresh. Complexity in this beer opens up the warmer it is, but it still is a muddled mess on the palate. If you have a bottle, sit on it.","Maxwell","Sep 29, 2013"

Nose of rich honey, apple sweet, roast caramel, and booze highlights. Smells very rich, with some earthy tones, also. Flavors are rich and sweet on the forward tongue, with a blending of roast caramel and honey balancing well. Rich and sweet, with a subtle warmth building as you drink, and a shift of the palate towards a more honey focused characteristic. Tangy sweet and rich into the aftertaste, with a cleanliness in the finish thanks to the body and the booze. The body is smooth and robust, which works perfectly with the flavor profiles. Solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Sep 05, 2013"

As such, it gave a nice, full head, mildly carbonated, thinnish mouthfeel. Nice amber color, otherwise tasted like an average ale. Not too bitter, definitely not sweet. Did not pick up on any honey or other allegedly complex notes, but as the ale is meant to mature with age, could have just been too young. Overall, not exciting, but not terrible.

The head was foamy and soft looking, it also had a good retention but not much lacing. The smell of the beer is of course an assault of honey aromas with a touch of malt in there too. No hop aroma at all. The taste of the beer betters as it warms up but at no point in time does this beer disappoint in this category. The beer is more malty when it's cold, as the beer warms the honey profile really shines through. The mouthfeel is very smooth, it's soft and very easy to drink, low carbonation but just enough to keep it alive and the booze comes out a little more as the beer warms.

Overall, this was very good. I had this with a good cigar, and it was the perfect compliment. It was pricey at $11 for a little over a pint, but it was delicious.

Lots of ripe fruit mixed with a honey bready thing. Slightly spicy most of the way through, but finishes with a twinge of alcohol and a lingering earthy bitterness. Medium to thick body, light carbonation, sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. I found this quite complex, but I feel the flavors are still competing, maybe this needs some time. Its good now, but I suspect it might be great with some age.","johnnnniee","Sep 30, 2011"

Color is a clear, dark orange copper amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is honey, malt, and a bit of funk. Flavor is the most interesting part - truly a cross between ale and mead. Malt, a hint of bitter hop and honey - minus the heavy honey flavors retaining only the smooth, mellow qualities. Body is full and lush with perfect carbonation to cut through the sweetness. Finish is like flavor and is quite long. Excellent after dinner beer; maybe one of the best I’ve ever had.","drpimento","Jul 23, 2011"

It's a little sweet in the nose, but definately bold with lots of alcohol warmth. The taste is much the same. It's sweet up front with a good honey character; lots of alcohol warmth and a solid pale malt base. This is a young beer that needs some aging to mellow out. The mouthfeel is fine.

Tastes of, you guessed it, honey mostly, sweet bready grains, dark fruits and currants, caramel, slightly vinous, and a little bitter citrus. No hint of the nearly 12% ABV contained within, and not overly bitter or sweet, very well balanced. Velvety smooth, low carbonation, viscous and coating but not syrupy or filmy.

The nose comprises honey (wow, no way!), white grapes, cane sugar, riesling, wheat, maple syrup, light citrus hops, and well-baked biscuits. The taste is very similar, with the honey and white wine-ish notes taking center stage, and then some. A nice bit of orange peel bitterness rides on up near the end to provide an added layer of complexity. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and an almost chewy feel.

However, it doesn't have the depth of character that I would expect from such a strong beer, while it also is lacking in intensity of honey character. It is a somewhat muddy mixture of dull, flabby honey and nondescript brown malt which is just shy of cloyingly sweet in the finish. I would have hoped for some brighter honey character and perhaps a greater complexity to the caramel malt, but both of these areas end up lacking. I don't know the age of this bottle (it seems to lack any sort of dating) and it might improve with time but as it stands, it is a bit of a disappointment.","nickfl","Jun 25, 2010"

The aroma was semi-sweet and complex, various malts and spices along with ripened fruit, sweet esters and honey. The flavors were full of honey, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, apples and a general spiciness along with hints of citrus.

There is a nice base sweetness that I'm guessing comes from all the honey that's used in its production. There are also notes of vanilla, dark fruits, and a bit of green apple. The one negative in the beer is that the 11.8% ABV really shows through. It's really boozy. The mouthfeel is a bit different then anything else I've had the pleasure of trying.

The BA descriptor labels this as a medieval concoction, and I guess I can envision it on a cold damp night bedded down in a castle in the northern climes, this stuff would warm the cockles. It would also kill any residual bacteria in the water used to brew it, which was an important consideration then. To modern sensibilities, this is just a really strong, potent, honey barley wine that has a big palate and a throaty burn on the way down.

The label also calls it barley wine style ale, so at least it has some peers in that category. The look was clear, reddish amber, and lightly carbonated, which was pretty similar to most barleywines. The aroma was deeply fruity and very intoxicating. The presence of the honey was clearly apparent with each deep breath. The taste was quite sweet and winey and the first sip had me worried if I was going to like this. As I got used to the sweetness, the caramelized, spicy, and slightly sour underlying flavors revealed themselves. The hops were not always apparent as their wispy citric dryness was easy to miss. What surprised me was the rather modest level of alcohol burn. I was anticipating a big bruiser with the 11.5% posted ABV, but this was more of a gentle giant. The sweet flavor did however make this only suitable for sipping. A little thin on the palette, but that is understandable, since honey used was likely all eaten up, and proportional to volume the grain bill was rather small. Quite a satisfying drink, and Im going to have to cellar some to see how time can add maturity.","rajendra82","Dec 17, 2006"

The bitterness is firm but subdued, the beer is nicely aged. The alcohol is definatly there, but not overpowering for a 12% beer.

Fruity aroma with a hint of banana and an earthy honey smell. Mellow alcohol mixed well with aromas of green grapes and a bit of vanilla. Sweet honey with some vinous alcohol and grape flavour. Rich caramel with vanilla just creeping in towards the end. Plenty of warmth in the finish, but this is very controlled. The body was on the light side and it left the palate quite dry. I quite liked the mixture of characters and was pleasantly surprised by the fruitiness. It's time to try more braggots. Thanks Viggo!","DrJay","Dec 25, 2005"

The price is reasonable as well, $6.99 for this much honey and malt is not a bad deal at all. I wish there was some spice/herb/fruit added to this for another layer of complexity, but as it is this is a fine Braggot, but nothing that will make your head explode with delight.

The aroma had lots of spice, mixed in with some honey and vanilla. The taste really brought out the spiciness of it. It was slightly hot in my mouth, partially due to the high ABV. Reminded me of DFH's Immort Ale in a way, but not as intensely sweet and easier on the palate. This braggot coated the inside of my mouth and definitely has some spice. It really became more complex as it warmed up. Drinkability wasn't bad for the ABV, but this braggot is definitely a sipper. Something to share with a friend.","Jacobob10","Sep 07, 2005"

Smells of orange honey, clover too, a mixture to be sure. The bees work and the yeast leave a high amount of alcohol, slowly fading lurking is the barley malt. Deep deep taste a full rush of complexity, you will need the whole bottle to understand it all fully. The alcohol right up front burns fast through to the honey melting on the tongue, finishes sweet of malt still some honey too. Slightly below room temp is best this bragget has a lot to offer.

The aroma is of sweet alcohol and, if you knew, then you could smell the honey. The taste is wonderful. A perfect balance of honey and bitterness - a much better version of bragget than those that i've tried from other breweries. A 'right on' honey beer with a full body and nice aftertaste.

4.42,13.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Brother Adam's Bragget Ale offers a slightly hazy robe of ruby-tinged chestnut beneath a short lid of creamy off-white foam that drops rather quickly to a thin collar and leaves only minimal lace (obviously due in great part to its high alcohol content). The nose, however, more than makes up for its shortcomings in appearance! It's rich and lively; loaded with honey, malt, fruit, and alcohol! And as it crosses the palate it's just as creamy as one might imagine - except for the mild sting of the alcohol involved. It's warming, and you can feel it passing through the throat and into the stomach. More honey is present in the flavor, and it's nicely entwined within doughy, vanilla and almond-laced cookie-dough-ish malt. Spicy alcohol accents, some fruitiness (sweet white raisins), and a very limited bitterness round things out. It's quite rich and enticing, yet its alcohol can be limiting.","NeroFiddled","Feb 02, 2005"

The aroma offered an interesting blend of wine notes, honey, and tea. The flavors were well balanced between honey sweetness, roasted malt, and tea-like hop bitterness. It was complex, but not exactly, what I was looking for. I did enjoy the full body, and found the brew to be quite drinkable - despite disagreeing with the hop selection.","AllThingsNinja","Dec 12, 2004"

Bottle also has a sticker stating "aged since 2001". The Bragget Ale pors out a hazy reddish amber with no visible head, just traces of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Carbonation is low but very tight, think "tiny bubbles" here. Chill haze disappears completely as the Bragget warms a bit. Aroma is very fruity and sweet, with a distinct whif of alcohol. Body is on the medium side for a barleywine, not too heavy at all. Taste is bold and spicy with alcohol at first taste, then blends to bright fruit and malty sweetness. Also has a nice vintage barleywine "mustiness", tastes well aged. Finish is very sweet with a delicious hint of wild honey lingering behind. Goes down relatively easy for a big big beer. Excellently crafted...","mikeys01","Apr 04, 2004"

The color is that of cider but the honey that is added gives this barley wine a body that I havent experienced before. This is thick stuff. Not a bad thick either.

I decided to share it with some homebrewing friends last night. My particular serving came in a 22 oz. bottle that had been aged since November 2000. It poured smoothly and seemed slightly thicker than normal. There was no head and in fact the beer itself was very lightly carbonated. It had a delicious, sweet honey aroma - no hops aroma noticeable at all. The flavor was also sweet, with a very noticeable alchohol presence. The mouthfeel was thick and full, but no effervesence. A very drinkable beer, but I'm glad I had some friends to share it with. If I drank one of these 22 oz. bottles all by myself, you could stick a fork in me - I'd be done.","soilguy","Aug 17, 2003"

The first sip should have warned me about the ABV, but I paid it no heed. I really enjoyed the honey taste. Not too sweet, just right. Before I knew it, "Voila!", the bottle was gone. And so was I.

4.25,9.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Sampled from a 22 oz. bomber, small gold sticker says "aged since November 2000". Fairly dark brown brew with very little off white foam, the foam vanishes almost instantly. Very rich, sweet malt and honey stick out big in the aroma along with an alcohol smell. Smooth mouthfeel with rather low carbonation. The flavor mirrors the aroma with lots of sweetness from both malt and honey. A good bit of dark dried fruit flavor (prune and raisin) in this one also. The flavor character overall reminds me of a nice Tawny Port, I think this would go great with a chocolatey dessert or a good cigar. Nicely warming alcohol feeling as it goes down.This stuff is really good for slow sipping on a cold and rainy fall day like today.","MaineBeerMan","Oct 26, 2002"
