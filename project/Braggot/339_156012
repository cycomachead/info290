3.98,4.5,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"What stuck out in the aftertaste was the mint-line briskness of the aftertaste and the booze. Boy, was this strong for a beer and even for a Braggot, this was about as heavy as one could get when it came to the alcohol. While not a knockout, this was no brew to be messed with and by the time I polished off this 25.4 oz. bottle, I could feel the warming and subtly overpowering effect of the alcohol. While not quite as good the other offerings in the Exit series, this was a worthy addition to the line and a solid beer to complement a winter that doesn't quite want to go away yet. Flying Fish is still one the best and creative breweries in my home state and this is another example of what that's so. Grab a bottle and let the warm up to the style has to offer!","JerzDevl2000","Mar 15, 2015"

3.83,0.5,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Real nice look which is a light copper color.  Blueberry smell of course with a bit of orange and sage.  Flavor is mainly blueberry with some orange, sage, honey and a bit of a bubble gum flavor. Definitely taste alcohol as well but not dominant. Reminds me oft a mild blueberry brandy but not near as thick and other flavors do come out. Mouthfeel is a little slick with light carbonation.  Overall an interesting treat as rarely get opportunity to have a braggot.  A sipper that would go great at a bonfire.  Hammonton should be proud as blueberries really come through.  Another unique exit series offering.","lushes22","Feb 23, 2015"

A beautiful blend of ingredients between the honey, malt, blueberry, orange peel, lemon peel, and Belgian and Champagne yeasts. I even noticed a couple pieces of blueberry skin at the bottom of my glass. I will most likely snatch up a bottle of this if I see it somewhere. A real treat to try on tap.","Jacobob10","Feb 19, 2015"
