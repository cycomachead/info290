4.18,3,3.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Foil capped, 500ml bottle served in a snifter.  Batch 1 - 11.4.2014 decanted for 30 minutes and served at cellar temp per the recommendations on the label.  Pours a deep brown with some ruby highlights when backlit.  No head; just a thin sudsy band around the shoulders.  Nose is quite vinous and somewhat reminiscent of a Bourdeaux.  There are also notes of oak and balsamic vinegar.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a hint of honey sweetness.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a virtually still carbonation.  This is a very acidic beer and it almost leaves the back of the throat feeling a bit parched between quaffs.  Overall, very interesting with a great deal of complexity.  Very different than any braggot I've ever had.  Well worth seeking out.","Jwale73","Feb 07, 2015"

OEC has been pumping out some very unique and interesting blends and this is no exception.  I wouldn't recommend this for everyone but it's definitely worth the try.","jaasen64","Dec 23, 2014"

3.7,-8.9,,,,,,"Bottle. Had this next to their Grandis. I am guessing that was the base beer. Well this one had coffee mead in it? It pours like a liqueur or brandy. Looks oily and actually leaves legs on the glass. No bubbles. The aroma is tart and has some diacetyl and acetone characteristics. An airy sweetness ripe with dried dark fruits. Not picking up much roast or coffee character. The flavor is also not very roasty or coffee-like. It's sweet but also sour and tannic. Vinous. Very, very rich. Woody and oaky. Slick feel with almost zero carbonation. Dense. Not sure I have had a beer quite like this. It will definitely make a place in my memory banks.","VelvetExtract","Dec 04, 2014"
