4.16,18.2,3.25,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong honey, citrus hops, sweet malt, yeast, wood, and slight grass. Fits the style of a Braggot. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of honey, sweet malt, alcohol, hint of hop, slight pale malt, wood, and slight grass. Overall, good strong honey flavor; best Braggot I've ever had.","Tone","Aug 07, 2014"

4.26,21,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,"Overall / Drinkability: A definite slow sipper. Pretty quickly after the first few sips I can start to feel the alcohol. So one is enough per night. But so very interesting that I keep wanting to go back and sip more and figure out all the flavors. I think I should have laid in another bottle of this and let it age. This has such complexity that I think it could keep me interested for a very long time. Truly and amazing beer.","damndirtyape","May 26, 2014"

3.71,5.4,4.25,3.75,3.5,4.5,3.5,"O - I commend Sprecher for stepping outside their box with Beyond - this is clearly a far cry from most of the beers they produce in terms of both style and alcohol percentage, of course experimentation doesn't always yield incredible results. Beyond is a Braggot, a style of beer not-so-often brewed that incorporates large quantities of honey (or beer blended with mead and spices). In Beyond, both aromatically and in flavor, the honey seems to be almost entirely fermented out leaving little little more than a lip-smacking sweetness behind to co-exist with the large malt bill. The combination of the two isn't breathtaking but it's certainly not awful either - it could use some time for the alcohol to mellow - I think that time would do this beer some justice. At the end of the day, Beyond might be polarizing to most because of it's uniqueness but, take a brief look into what a Braggot was and possibly could be (as it often varies by those who blend it on site) and you'll see Sprecher's Beyond is an attempt to be pondered if not respected for it's dangerous drinkability.","BeerFMAndy","0"

3.93,11.6,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Overall- Despite the fact that this is a Sprecher beer, this is actually pretty good for the style though I've only had Kuhnhenn's take. It's up there with Kuhnhenn's version, which was boozier and just as interesting.","Stevedore","0"
