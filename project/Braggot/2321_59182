4.29,0,,,,,,"D: I love Braggot so I immediately ordered this beer when I saw it on-tap. It's nice that so many local brewers are experimenting with honey beers. More on the beer side than most of the braggots I've had, I love both genres. Springtime puts it perfectly, hard to imagine drinking this at any other time, a great beer for late spring.","Halcyondays","0"
