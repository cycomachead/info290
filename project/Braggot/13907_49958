3.06,-18.6,4,3,3,3,3,"Taste follows the nose. It just seems the flavors aren't dancing in rhythm. A slight sweetness, not honey so much. A very slight hop presence. Not sure if I like this beer. Seems average.","Mebuzzard","Nov 27, 2009"
4.2,11.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This was my first Braggot so I was unsure of what to expect, but I ended up enjoying this beer quite a bit. Bottle says stout blended w/ honey and flavors for that seem to hold true.","riored4v","Sep 30, 2009"
3.92,4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: I've only had one other Braggot, and this one didn't quite stand up to it. That said, I still enjoyed this beer a lot. It's quite unique, and a very nice effort on the part of the folks at Crabtree.","Rayek","Jun 30, 2009"
3.85,2.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Had this beer at the brewery. It was poured into a pint glass. The foam was brown color with slight green tinting. The drink itself is dark brown hue like used motor oil. The smell is that of roasted malts with a sweet tones of caramel. The taste of the beer itself is that of a honey, malt, and an alcohol base. This beer is a good beer. One that I wouldn't want day and night but a good change within the order of beers.","Tolnik","Jun 20, 2009"

3.68,-2.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, an interesting beer mixing honey and an imperial stout. A little much on the sweet side for me.","Beaver13","Jun 05, 2009"

3.71,-1.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, I was real excited to try this beer. Not a bad attempt at all. I really liked the fusion of the english mild and sweetness of the honey. If the imperial stout fused in this beer was better than average, this would be one hell of a beer.","rhinos00","0"
