I am NOT a fan of honey flavored meads or honey in general, so this Braggot  surprised me.   I call it lightly sweet with a nice effervescence, and an earthy undertone(must be the beer portion) and a fresh baked shortbread- like character....  Gosh, just a nice quaff ! Very impressed with this.","LauraTheExplorer","Dec 24, 2014"

4.15,6.1,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"The history of Braggot dates back centuries in northern Europe. Braggots are meads made with malted barley in addition to the honey. Our Braggot won a Bronze medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival. Brewed with wildflower honey and rich, dark specialty malts, the final product is akin to a Scottish Ale, with an added earthy depth and sweetness. Vinous notes combine with earthy flavors and a touch of toffee and biscuit character with just a hint of alcohol warmth. This is a complex sipper sure to warm even the coldest nights.","WCW","Dec 24, 2014"

With warmth, the booze does come out in droves to meet the horrible sweetness, giving a semblance of a balance to the tasting. As far as a braggot goes, this tastes more mead than beer, with a strong showing of the raisins, figs, and fruity undertones held within, rather than with much depth of grain or bitterness of hops. This beer is one quick step away from being an amazing barrel aged beer, as it has enough intrinsic diacetyls and buttery warmth to carry it. That might make it more approachable and acceptable by many professional whale hunters, but alternatively could push it even further into uncharted, extreme territories.","TheBrewo","May 05, 2014"

Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a small foamy light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing as expected. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, molasses, toffee, chocolate, raisin, prune, honey, biscuit, tobacco, light nuttiness, floral, and dark earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and honey notes; with hardly any alcohol presence. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, honey, raisin, prune, biscuit, tobacco, leather, light nuttiness, floral, herbal, and dark earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, dark fruit, molasses, honey, biscuit, tobacco, leather, and dark earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt flavors with honey; with hardly any cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 16%, with only a slight warming noticed after the finish; definitely a slow sipper though. Overall this is a fantastic Braggot style! Incredible complexity and balance of malt/honey flavors; and insanely smooth to sip on for being 16%. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 31, 2013"

A beefier middle that ressembles beer a little more, probably where the barley in the product shows itself a bit. Alcohol in the finish, especially as it warms a bit.
