4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"is this that style of beer from the old world made with no hops? i think it might be. it pours a soothing looking pale orange color with a small white head. it smells incredibly floral, lavender i reckon, with all kings of interesting yeast going on. the flavor is totally lavender, not quite hand soap, but similarly potent. its pollenated and fresh, more springtime than autumn, but delicious just the same. the alcohol is also pretty potent. feel is good, smooth and well carbonated, with a nice medium body. its a real different brew, the floral notes are so up front, more so than almost any beer i can remember. i like it a lot, but the small 8oz. pours are plenty. overall something one of a kind and worth a try. i had it at vine street, but i think its on at all three mountain sun spots.","StonedTrippin","Sep 01, 2012"

4.3,7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This is not your typical American Strong Ale. It pours a delicate sand color with a tan head. The nose is very malty and sweet with just enough hops to keep it in control. The taste is also malt strong with mellow some floral hops. There is a well balanced honey flavor in the mix. This stuff has a full yet crisp body. Delicious.","rye726","0"
