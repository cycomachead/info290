It pours hazy amber with a thick rocky head, alowly descenting to icebergs of foam that produce thick lace. Brown chunks suspended in the beer give it a snow globe quality or perhaps a desert sandstorm. The beer is not that old and there are no hints of oxidation on tha palate. On the palate the fruit starts as caramel sweetened peach that gradually becomes more raisin-like. The flavors at the beginning feature the alcohol interacting with the malt and the yeast while by the finish the interactions between the alcohol and the hops become more prominent.

That said....the beer pours a bright orange with thick frothy white head and EXCELLENT lacing and later pooling thin layers of foam. A "live" ale which I am fond of since it lives and matures much longer. Nose is sweet malts mingling with spicy hops, lemon grass, and Belgian bready yeast. Taste is up front sweet candy malts and sweet fresh bread yeast---ahhh the Belgians and their fantastic malts and yeast strains! The sweetness subsides into a citrus note, turning into a bittering hops note that lingers on and on. Very nice mouthfeel, nicely carbonated and smooth drinking. Excellent by ale standards, but not really a true Belgian triple. Great for hops heads, a bit over the top for Belgian lovers of which I AM.","Brutaltruth","Jul 20, 2014"

3.9,-0.8,4.25,3.5,4,4,4,"11.2 oz bottle into a tulip. Burnt amber, hazy, creamy white head. This is the European hopped version of a Belgian IPA. Hops are punch of herbs and spice - grassy, peppery, earthy (almost dirty, in a good way), slightly soapy and powdery. Slather of caramel on the palate seems to balance things out a little, but thankfully this isn't a sweet beer. Ethanol flairs just a little as it warms. Ultra dry finish with lively carbonation gives a nice fluffy mouthfeel. A pretty solid brew, nice flavors to sip and savor. What makes this a triple IPA as the label states - the ABV I guess? It's not quite as hoppy as even a DIPA.","bump8628","Apr 28, 2013"

Smell is of malt, honey, citrus fruit, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a honey flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the mouthfeel is off on this one.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 10, 2013"

Very tropical and earthy nose with hints of pineapple and mango along with orange peel, caramel, bready malt and a touch of apricot. The nose follows suit with hints of pineapple, apricot, pine, grapefruit, mango, candy sugar, caramel, and a bit of grass and biscuit as well. Not your typical Belgian IPA as this leans a bit more towards the West Coast. The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy and slightly oily and boozey on the finish. I had this on tap at Moeder Lambic in Brussels last week and forgot to ask if it was the Special Edition version as it was much bolder with a huge fresh hop character. This bottled version is still a very solid IPA, but I preferred the draft.","beerdrifter","Nov 14, 2012"

The smells a little barnyard and funk along with some medium lemon grass hops and a decent caramel backbone. The feel is medium to even thick for an ipa.

Aromas of big caramel, orange, grapefruit, citrus rind, pineapple, herbal, floral, grass, molasses, honey, bread, toast, light pine, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, complexity; the bottle age is definitely apparent being that this is a Belgian IPA. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, grass, herbal, floral, toast, biscuit, honey, pine, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus zest, grass, herbal, floral, toast, biscuit, honey, earth, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Excellent flavor balance and complexity; great hop/malt flavor balance; zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA! Great hop/malt balance and nice complexity; extremely smooth to sip on for a 9% beer. A very enjoyable offering as I expected.","superspak","Nov 05, 2012"

The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, citrus, citrus hop, spice, and big sweetness. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. First off, the sweetness on the flavor of this one was almost too much as my score will attest to. Luckily there were some citrus notes that helped to bring it back to an average brew for the style, but there was really no real balance going on here which was very saddening to me.

Tastes of rancid pine, highly bitter(like a fresh bigfoot) with light tropic fruits. The belgian yeast while there, is not as pronounced as some in the style. This is more American than Belgian IMO.

4.23,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This has become one of my new favorite triples. I think that people may be critiquing this beer a bit too harshly stating that it is not truly an IPA. Belgian IPA's can be deceiving to a person who is used to drinking American IPA's. The IBU's in an American IPA are through the roof and tend to be way more aggressive in their hoppy characteristics. This Belgian Triple IPA is a great brew in my opinion because it creates a wonderful balance between sweet citrus and bitter hops. There is not one aspect that completely overshadows the other with this beer and the complexity really hides the high alcohol content well.","Samashley","Dec 23, 2010"

A faint smell but some citrus, orange smell after some swirling--which seemed a bit odd to do for a beer. Good flavor highlighted by the orange, citrus flavor picked up from the smell, with a solid caramel malt base coming through. You can pick up the traditional Belgian yeast coming through as well. A light-to-medium bodied beer with good, but not overpowering carbonation. A very drinkable beer, though for the price, I'd probably choose a Belgian IPA with a stronger hop character.

Super cloudy and opaque liquid, however, the red tinged pumpkin orange has serious glow, fills the glass with color, lots of tiny bubble beads visible as well. Sweet tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus explodes in the nose, adds juiciness to the apricot, peach, nectarine, mango fruit scents, brawny peppery component, the pine adds edginess, hard to distinguish clear malt scents but something is softening the harder edges here. Medium-bodied, heavily whipped up carbonation yet fine enough that it does not prevent the weight from getting things sinking into the palate. The pepper and crisp spice pairs up with herbal bite to set the tone early, forestalls the appearance of the tangerine, grapefruit citrus, no small feat. Drier fruit profile, more nectarine, pineapple, papaya than riper apricot or peach, tangy. More dead yeast cells than breadiness, offers a charcoal dustiness too.

This one appears a glowing slightly clouded orange color for me, with bright white peach tinted head. Rocky and thick effervescent head the true Belgian style lacing going on, intricate and layered perfectly with each sip from my Allagash chalice. Aromatics offer up lemon/lime/grapefruit citrus fruits with a really appealing grassiness going on, spicy edges from the yeast and sugary layers of candy coated hops from the tropical fruit mango to the simple syrup tones I'm getting. Caramel coated hops, wrapped in sugar. This is bitter but alcohol and malts stand up to European hop additions. The grapefruit, grassy/herbal, and tropical fruit mango/pineapple tones tend to explode on the palate and the bready spicy yeast blends perfectly amongst the hodgepodge of flavors going down. Mouthfeel is effevescent with carbonation smooth with occasional hop burps clearing out the sinuses this is a nice drinking beer definitely hides the 9% abv.
