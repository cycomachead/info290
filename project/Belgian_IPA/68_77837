The hop profile works out fairly well with the sweet yeast, and there's a lingering hop that isn't that bad at all. I still don't think the specific combination of the sweet, banana-y yeast and American hops works out though. I've enjoyed a handful of Belgian IPAs, but they've all strayed away from the overly banana-y flavor profile. If you actually enjoy Belgian IPAs, you might like this. It's obvious that the style has done great for Flying Dog, since this is their second Belgian IPA to get bottled. But, much like Raging Bitch, I can't recommend it.","shand","Apr 30, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, along with a sharp vein of grapefruit peel running through, stabbing the tongue from time to time. But not necessarily in a bad way. Most of the time, anyway. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish.

The two pieces fit together well and make for a highly drinkable ale with a refreshing lighter taste in the package of the heavier body and potency of some of the higher abv IPAs short of the imperial class. The result is undeniably worth trying for fans of either style, and will surely appeal to many in both camps.","Cylinsier","Feb 07, 2013"

Tastes are bold and well balanced, fruity, biscuity, citrus - orange and grapefruit, Belgian yeast, spice, astringent and fairly dry on the finish. Thinner body with tons of carbonation that is not off-putting. Overall, nice take on the style, but not much of a wow factor. Still recommendable though.","barnzy78","Jan 23, 2013"

Let me start by saying that "IPA" should not be anywhere near the name of this beer. It is a bottle conditioned Belgian style ale, with a slight touch of hops at the end. It pours an amazing head (watch out- it will foam up all over the place). The taste is complex and full of esters. If you swirl the last bit of beer in the bottle, it will produce a crazy Dr. Seuss like foam to top your beer off with. The flavors go in every direction, with a yeasty sediment cloud lurking right below the head. An amazing American version of a Belgian farmhouse beer. Just drop the IPA from the name please. What a fun beer! Nice job, Flying Dog.","GuyIncognito","Jan 09, 2013"

This beer didn't have the greatest drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the flavors have a hard time holding my attention, one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both pretty damn good with a nice complex aroma and tons of great head. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance, less overly bitter hops and more farmhouse flavors could makes this a great beer. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I would rather have a Raging Bitch, it's worth a try, but don't expect it to blow your mind. All in All this beer was solid, but the lack of balance prevented it from being something great, I like that Flying Dog is blurring the line between styles but I think it could have been executed just a little better. I may need to try a fresh bottle, I was pretty sure this beer was newly released and it just showed up at The Lager Mill, that's why I am surprised to see it was a week away from being out of date, I don't really understand that.","StoutHunter","Jul 30, 2012"

Smell is powerful clove, banana, grass, citrus, and biscuit. Taste clove, banana, citrus, and grapefruit, but very balanced in a aggressive way. Body is medium large, lots of carbonation, a little dry, and drinkable. I love how Flying Dog takes styles that aren't my favorite Belgian and Farmhouse and hop them up so I enjoy. Did it better with Raging Bitch, but really enjoyed this also.","SawDog505","Jul 20, 2012"
3.71,0.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Wildeman Farmhouse IPA pours a hazy tangerine, with minimal visibility. A four finger high mountain of white foam comes together atop the beer, and head retention is out of this world. The lacing is left in a solid ring at the top of glass, but it's fairly splotchy underneath. Despite all that, the nose is a little bit weak. There are some bubble gum fruity and light clove aromas present though, about what I'd expect for a Belgian IPA. The flavor is a bit more phenolic, with clove shining through more than anything else. There is a bit of bitterness, and some citrus peel hoppiness present as well as a brief opening of cracker-like maltiness. Still, I found myself checking the bottle for the "best by" code (August 14th) because of the relatively tame hop presence. The body is suitably light, but the carbonation is a little too dull. Wildeman is a pretty solid beer, it's just a little light on the hops for a Belgian IPA.","axeman9182","Jul 18, 2012"

Overall, it’s actually not a bad farmhouse ale of the classic saison variety, but personally I think they’ve somewhat missed the mark on the IPA front. The Belgian IPA category is deceivingly catch-all, covering super-hoppy BSPAs (many of which are excellent), Tripel-DIPA hybrids (hit or miss, but can be huge hits), white / witbier-IPA hybrids (still intriguing, still not sure what to make of the concept) and saison / farmhouse-IPA hybrids (love the idea, have yet to see one knock it out of the park). This is a good beer, no doubt about it, and I’d drink it again—but I’m not sure it helps define the category. I would love to give this another shot though, especially with a fresher bottle!","fmccormi","Jul 02, 2012"

Definitely drinks more like a saison than an IPA, the hops being subdued by the huge spice profile, which is right up in your face, as well as the alcohol which seemed unusually hot for a lighter beer.

Yeast is in the forefront of the aroma profile with hops rounding it out with a nice citrus and piney edge. The flavor is yeast as well with hops coming through as mostly bitterness more than flavor... which I find is common in farmhouse/Belgian IPA beers. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and keeps you coming back for more.

Yeasty and sweet banana flavors up front that transition to citrus grapefruit and pineapple hops thru the middle and pine flavors toward the end. A light biscuity backbone beneath and a spicy, peppery flavor that rides overtop from start to end where it intensifies. Finishes with a spicy pine hop aftertaste.

3.95,6.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a tulip glass a clear light to medium golden with a large blooming white head that stuck nicely to the glass leaving multiple rings of lace as it settled slowly into a frothy mass.Alot of tropical fruit and sharp grapefruit hop aromas,really fresh and inviting,slight yeasty phenols underneath the hops.Slightly medicinal and citric hops on the palate but they seem to lose some punch pretty quickly,spiced yeasy phenols play a small role.The flavors lack some depth and complexity but this is a pretty good beer,love the looks and aromas.","oberon","Apr 25, 2012"
2.88,-22.2,5,4.5,2,2,2.5,"Pours a brilliant lemonade clouded godlen color with a big white frothing head large bubbles but sturdy carbonation, pour soft the beer is pretty agitated off the bat when you pop the cap you will hear the carbonation release. Aroma, first off lemon/lime notes with hints of tropical fruit dare I say mango/pineapple combo. A bit of funky yeast similar to the same yeast they use in Ragin' Bitch, spicy and a bit funky. Flavor wise this hits with big time bitterness from both hop additions, spicy yeast notes, black pepper qualities and something I can't pin my finger on. The artwork and the beer are pretty crazy I like how the new sixpack holders proudly state that this stuff is being brewed in Frederick, MD something us beergeeks have been in tune with since they left Denver years ago. Serve it a bit cold it masks some of the bitterness that I found kind of offensive in my first couple sips fade a bit. The yeast is bitter, the hops are bitter, and there seems to be citrus pith that is bitter with minimal sweetness masked by the Belgian yeast strain this beer is a bit of a cluster. Mouthfeel is cloyingly dry and bitter with layers of hops, spice, alcohol, citrus peel just downright awful texture starts to make me want to gag...also you have to deal with the high level of carbonation I'm pawning the rest of these beers off on my cousin Joe, who pretty much loves any beer from Flying Dog. Overall I will not revisit or waste my time on such a harsh beer drinking experience. I like Belgians,saisons, IPAs, white ales, but not when they're all blended together.","WVbeergeek","Apr 24, 2012"

3.8,2.7,4,4,3.5,4,4," The taste comes off as strong piney flavor at first with subtle belgian yeast which gives a light spice and it is slightly obscured by the hops which have some mild citrus tinges and the yeast adds a light funkiness to the middle which could almost be mistaken for brett with light barnyard character. The flavor recedes into a bitter and dry finish which is actually refreshing given the carbonation. Overall I like this in comparison to some other American Belgian style IPA's. It is very tasty with emphasis on hops and nice yeast augmentation.","Slatetank","Apr 12, 2012"
3.8,2.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This was certainly an interesting take on a Belgian IPA, with that crisp juiciness of the hops and easy feeling body wanting this to go down quickly yet that bold spiciness from the yeast makes you hold back some. I guess in the end, I could have used a bit less spice here but I didn’t let it ruin my experience with this beer, as it’s worth checking out. This is a different beast than the Raging Bitch and I liked it.","Kegatron","Apr 10, 2012"

3.9,5.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a lively level of carbonation. That full 7.5% alcohol is felt and really exaggerated by the dryness of this brew and the herbal hops. The whole idea here of a saison/ipa hybrid was well executed. Whereas the aroma is very saison forward, it is much more balanced between the 2 in the flavor department. If the alcohol was tamed down a bit I could see myself drinking a bunch of this quite effortlessly. However, as-is with its dryness and alcohol punch I am only good for a glass or 2 at a time. This is worth a try if you havent had it yet.","stakem","Apr 03, 2012"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Sure enough, it reminds a bit of their recent Harvest Secret Stash offering and works in a similar fashion, slightly hoppier pointing to their Raging Bitch but without getting there.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The palate opens big and juicy with a good blend of citrus hops (light oranges) and plenty of fruity yeasty phenols. Papaya, mango and more tropical fruit to go with it. The honey and sugar aspects from the malt really do amplify the yeasty phenols. Bitterness is low for an IPA but high for a saison. The more rustic and barnyardy characters from saisons isn't really found here either. Drying and fruit on the finish, the, yeast does linger on with plenty of tropical fruit. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is quite enjoyable. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this beer works IMO.","DefenCorps","Feb 05, 2012"
