It's a decent balance between bitter and citrus that, while I find thin bodied, is very refreshing and I'm finding it very easy to get through this 750ml bottle quickly.  The alcohol is hidden very well but will sneak up on a person I'm guessing.  I'm pleasantly surprised that I am enjoying this as much as I am, as I'm not a huge IPA guy, but the melding of styles works beautifully!  I recommend this one and would have no issues picking this up again!","ChrisCage","0"

4.11,2,,,,,,"Overall (4.0): This beer is a bit all over the place, but in a thoroughly entertaining way. The appearance is excellent but a little non-standard for the style; the aroma is funky and slightly off-kilter, but bright and aromatic at the same time; the flavor is very complex with some unexpected characters, but well-crafted; and the feel is as close to perfect as anything could be, especially how well it complements the flavor. Some things don’t mesh at all times, and I’ve never been big on the garlicky hop notes, but it still works. This is just a very complex, deeply interesting brett beer, and I like it. (Still like Bitter Monk better, though. :-)","fmccormi","Sep 10, 2014"

4.25,5.5,,,,,,"750 ml corked bottle poured in a chalice.  The bottle has two intro paragraphs describing various frontiers of human achievement, plus some information about the white IPA in the bottle.  Quite amusing.  The beer pours yellow in color, with a thin white head.  The first smell that hit my nose was grapefruit, then a bit of tangerine.  A lot of citrus and fruit notes.  The taste is like a fruit salad at first, transitioning to a bitter hop flavor once it reaches the back of your palette.  The finish is a bit of oak and herbs, and the spices are noticeable.  Overall, excellent.","ENogueira","Beers"

I couldn't have asked for more in the aroma. It is a complexity of brett, citrus, hops, and spices. The flavors followed suit, but I would have liked a little more. There are no flavors out of place, but the flavor came off a bit diluted, the more I drank. A great beer, but I was looking for something with more flavor. Still among the best int he style I have ever had. Well done, but I won't be running back to the store to get another $11 bomber.","NoLeafClover44","Jul 14, 2014"

4.09,1.5,3.25,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Thin bone white head, mostly loose and bubbles off swiftly, very bright and seems to reflect light nicely, the lacing is the sort which initially forms a very thin yet broad sheet but has little stick and as a whole it just glides down the glass sides. Cloudy yet bright canary yellow colored liquid, very difficult to see any bubbles inside the glass, warm luminescence to it. The nose most prominently hits you with tart white grapefruit notes, lots of salty accents and burnt dark bread crusts, more finished bread than yeasts, quite grassy, there’s something like an herb infused olive oil thing going on too, maybe pineapple or nectarine but you would be hard pressed to call the scents fruity. Medium-bodied, the carbonation swells immediately through the attack which gives it a creamier mouth feel, needed for when that lemon and white grapefruit citrus slash on through. Pepper and salt, green grass, clove and coriander, all contribute to a bright, tangy experience. Here the peach, apricot, nectarine and persimmon fruit is sweeter and more longlasting. There is a certain vinous quality, not sure I’d call it out and out bretty, likewise the yeasts are tame and not particularly softening. Fresh finish, given the elements it throws at you remains very good on the drinkability scale.","farrago","Jan 27, 2014"

4.13,2.5,4,4.75,3.75,4,4.25,"The problem with beers like this, incredibly hoppy / citrusy but bone dry, is that much of the juicy citrus character is lost in the flavor due to the dryness. This beer is a testament to the wonders of Indian coriander, it doesn’t have that dirty herbal character that western coriander does and it really integrates very nicely with the kumquat and Galaxy hops; interestingly enough, I hadn’t realized that coriander and kumquats were used here; I wholly attributed their flavor contributions to the hops, but now having read the label they most definitely contribute. The pepper to adds a nice spiciness to this brew that was again mistaken for hop character. Back to the problem, without the residual malt sweetness that even supports the driest of the usual IPAs, this beer has lost the juicy citrus character that would be otherwise be noticeable in the flavor. While I have compared this a lot to an IPA, it is clearly not one, given the interpretive take the style can have, I would say this fits into the Saison category (at least better than it fits anywhere else). Since I do love hoppy and I do love Saisons, this beer is right up my alley; exceedingly enjoyable and I doubt I will be able to hold on to my second bottle long enough to allow the Brettanomyces presence to increase much.","Gueuzedude","Sep 28, 2013"

Pours lightly cloudy bright golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, pear, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, pepper, clove, coriander, white wine, light oak, floral, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and wine barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, peach, pineapple, pear, pine, coriander, clove, pepper, white wine, light oak, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Moderately earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, peach, pineapple, pear, coriander, clove, pepper, white wine, light oak, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and moderate wine barrel flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very crisp, prickly, and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic wild Belgian IPA! All around awesome balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and barrel flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on.

Seriously though, read the back of the bottle if you have the opportunity, because it is especially inspiring. That aside, the most enjoyable quality of the beer itself was its taste. The nose starts off nicely, giving bright florals and grain against the included advertised ingredients. The Bretty remains ever pervasive, but really begins to pop in the flavoring, even as the aroma fades into booziness with warmth. The taste, again, shows all of what you would expect, with bitterness from the whole peppercorns and citric kumquat inclusions alike. The oak, coriander spiciness, and Brett also blend through the finish, giving a final picture of cohesion and fullness. This is reflected in the creamy feel, which helps keep the aforementioned robustness in check. While certainly made headway on “the trail” with this one, with the wildness of the yeast and the unconventional fruit and spice, hopefully those to follow with further mold and refine what Anchorage classifies as their “White IPA”.","TheBrewo","Aug 12, 2013"

This stuff pours a hazy auburn-brass topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises funky Brett, grapefruit rind, mild grass, and a touch of lime. The taste brings in more of the same, with the Brett hamming it up on stage and some lemon and lime trying their best to blend into the background. Some minor notes of earth and wood (need we build a log cabin in Louisiana?) sneak in there as well, but aren't able to cause much of a ruckus. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, this seems like a godsend for any lovers of Brett and/or hops.

The aroma offers up lime, tangerine, grapefruit and a sour lime sort of wild yeastiness. The taste has a very effervescent quality and it is so much so it is tough to sink you teeth into the experience. I’m getting fruity and tart grapefruit notes that are sliding into lime like citrus and some citrusy tartness. Pretty nice but the huge carbonation detracts from the experience.","jbaker67","Jul 03, 2013"

Pours out half foam atop a cloudy light straw liquid. Lots of lace and mad retention. The aroma is certainly tart and a bit funky. Saison like aroma with lots of spice a bit of tart citrus and tropical fruits with some hops still evident and a vinous character deep underneath. The flavor is more funk than tart with bits of citrus evident as well as some light wine notes. Medium to light body with a huge level of carbonation and a dry crisp funky mouthfeel.

Aroma is big lemon peel, oak, funky brett, some light spices and hints of earthy hops. More of a farmhouse ale than an IPA on the nose. Light bodied with lots of carbonation (maybe too much?). Flavor is dusty bitter up front, followed by a bit of pine hop, and then finishes with some sweet lemon and pineapple. Sour kumquattyness. Very, very dry to the point that I need a drink of water afterward. The up front bitter is unpleasant and seems a bit off for my liking. I could definitely see this as a summer beer, and it drinks extremely light for 7.5%. But overall I am much less impressed with this than others.

The barrel is hidden by the bold hopping, as is the wit yeasts and spices. The brett comes through, as does the kumquat, but none of these flavors are in harmony and treat the pallate more like a battlefield than anything else.

There's also a solid hop presence still lingering, providing a fruitiness and a nice background bitterness. It's an extremely dry beer, with the brett and hops contributing strongly to that. So much going on here that it's really not worth picking apart in the review, each sip reveals new facets. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, highly carbonated, and (as before mentioned) very dry. Overall, Anchorage's Galaxy White IPA has held up very well a year past bottling. It's very interesting, extremely complex, and very tasty.","shand","May 07, 2013"

I would leave the coriander out, as I think it doesn't add a ton to the flavor that couldn't be there otherwise, but it does sort of crowd a some stuff out. wheat malt first, with the Belgian witbier yeast and some lemon pepper stuff, which I guess is aided by the peppercorn addition, works well with the yeast anyway. it gives way to a fruity hop bitterness that's really intense, and there is some acid from the wine barrels that exacerbates this. there is a ton going on here, and the bretty bitter finish is unique and memorable. white ipa with galaxy hops, coriander, kumquat, peppercorns, wit yeast, then aged in wine casks, dry hopped with galaxy, and conditioned with brett. its insane, and it works. light airy feel from the carbonation, it seems almost too light to handle all the flavor, but it does somehow. a really phenomenal beer that im sure a quantum physicist is behind, its just so advanced...","StonedTrippin","Feb 06, 2013"

A high level of carbonation made this one want to jump out of the bottle. I will forgive the minor inconvenience. The aroma was very discreet with floral notes and some Belgian accents. In the initial taste, I thought I was drinking soapy water. The citrus notes that come with the Brett combine with the floral notes to make me wonder if the glass was properly cleaned. The backbone of hops is mild, even for a Belgian IPA. The mouthfeel was aggressively bubbly, like drinking a warm can of Sprite. The carbonation mercifully subtracted the soapy taste from my mouth. I can not endorse this beer.","JohnnyHopps","Dec 23, 2012"

The aroma is of breadiness, lemon zest and floral and earthy hops. The aroma is deep and full. The taste is unique. There is a lemonzest and corriander taste up front along with brett. The middle waters out a little and you get belgian yeast and some funk. The back end is all hops, it is a floral earthy hop at the back end. Not overly bitter but it balances out very well. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, in fact when I uncorked the bottle i almost killed three people. Mouthfeel is stingy and bubbly.

4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Anchorage's Galaxy White IPA pours a fairly hazy lemon yellow. Four fingers or so of frothy white foam balloons up to fill the top two thirds of the glass. Head retention is very good, but lacing is a bit on the spotty side. Eight to nine months after bottling, it's hard to rate this as a Belgian IPA, as it's more of a wild ale at this point. The nose has a good bit of barnyard funk to it, as well as a citric tartness to it. There's also the last remnants of some more tropical fruit aromas from the fading Galaxy hops. Again with the flavor profile, there's a strong funky, brett presence. I don't know what kumquats taste like, but given that they're related to oranges, I'm attributing to them the citrus bent that the light tartness here has. Just as with the nose, the fruity hop flavor is a shell of what it must have been soon after bottling. The body is wonderfully dry, and the carbonation is very lively. It could stand to be just a little bit more so, but it's still very close. I really dug this bottle of Galaxy White IPA, and I'd love to try one that's much more fresh, as I think it'd be a very different, but still very good beer.","axeman9182","Sep 30, 2012"

After a while, the white wine and bready yeast notes come forward. Pretty dry from all of these elements and the citrus characteristic from the galaxy hop and sweetness from whine and wit yeast are kind of overshadowed.

4.45,10.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"UPDATE: if you want to let this one sit for about 6-7 months the brett will come out to play with some nice barnyard and funk. the hops aren't quite there anymore but still provide a nice bitterness. the nose on the beer has gone nuts in that time as well with some sourness and funk.","SHODriver","0"

3.14,-22.1,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"I think I had higher expectations for this beer than it delivered. That said, it was an interesting beer and I appreciate the experimental nature of it. Perhaps a little bit more of the citrusy Witbier qualities to help balance out the dryness of the wood aging would help.","ShanePB","Feb 19, 2012"
4.22,4.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall very nice, great hops and light Brett characteristics blended well without either overpowering the other, and even a nice light malty base to back them up. A well done tasty beer.","jlindros","Feb 19, 2012"

4.12,2.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer's definitely a pleasant surprise. An IPA with the malt balance of a wheat beer and every bit as drinkable as the two styles.","SpeedwayJim","Feb 06, 2012"

3.82,-5.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured at the EBF night session. The beer poured out as a pale hazy yellow color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer gave off the aromas of bread, citrus and Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer seemed to me like a typical witbier, it was citrusy and rather mild in flavor. The peppercorn didn't stand out too much for me but there was a bitterness in there from the fruits that were brewed into it. The mouthfeel was light, carbonated and refreshing for the most part. Overall it was a pretty good brew but nothing too exciting to me.","Knapp85","Feb 05, 2012"
