Medium full body, slight chewy texture and medium carbonation. Delicious flavour profile, one of my favourite hoppy Kuhnhenn offerings.","liamt07","Nov 19, 2012"

The flavor brings a sweet banana bubblegum and grassy wheat grain with a lemony touch throughout. Maybe an orange idea too. This is medium-plus bodied with a pretty thick feel over tiny carbonation that brings a tingly addition. The citrus banana bread is different, it's a Belgian ale that’s sweet and unique. Not disappointing though I’m not sure I’d pay another $18 a half growler for a repeat performance, but arguably worth it. Nice!","Durge","Jun 25, 2012"

The taste was a bit worse with a bit of alcohol and the flavors just clashing completely. Alcohol in the feel. This just did not drink well and was unfortunately not a good beer. I'd like to think I just got this at the wrong time and would be up for trying it again, as I'm normally a fan of pretty much everything that Kuhnhenn does.","Thorpe429","Nov 12, 2010"

The taste is also way to sweet, banana and bubblegum, a total lack of hops. Wheat finish...The feel is ok, not easy to drink just way to sweet. This is not a pale ale...This beer is really not good, needs to be much more balanced with hops. If you want bubblegum get a gumballhead.","jrallen34","May 31, 2010"

Well I guess they have it classifed as belgian on here, and the brew put had it listed as a golden ale. It was a interesting offering, thats for sure. The 8.5% alc wasn't noticable at all.

The bitterness from the hops last but become less prominent as they are countered by the graham cracker and biscuit malts as well as a very prominent bready yeast character. Hits of light crisp fruit and ripe banana add to the complexity but the hops are the star here. As mentioned above they are very floral and sweet up front with a slight bitterness that lasts throughout into a delicious dry finish. The ABV is excellently masked making it dangerously drinkable.

I just assumed from the name that it would be an IPA, but that's not the case. Honestly, I don't know whether this is supposed to be any specific style. Regardless, on the nose, I'm getting hops (simcoe, I assume), sweet malt, and a tad of honey. Same with the taste, which is quite sweet and floral. But there are also some clove and spice qualities characteristic of a Belgian brew. So perhaps this is a hybrid? Body is a tad on the thick syrupy side for my taste, and drinkability suffers for it. An interesting beer, but it doesn't come across as tightly focused. A bit of multiple personality disorder here with too much going on for my taste.","waltonc","Aug 28, 2009"

The hops definitely shine up front in the flavor department, lots of citrus; clementine, pineapple, peaches, and grapefruit. The sweet hops are quickly taken over by the bready yeast which lingers in the aftertaste. Once again, I could use more hops in the taste department but I shouldn't complain seeing it's a Belgian Ale. Body is medium with a smooth feel and a fair amount of carbonation.

This beer does the same thing in such an opposite way. The sweet bubblegum and fresh fruit flavors of this beer are so unique. The double Simcoe shows off how Simcoe can be used in a big bold hoppy beer, and Kuhnhenn has shown with this one how you can craft a perfect Belgian brew using simcoe. I love it.

The flavour was more of the same, with a juicy citrus character and great balance. Good attenuation with little residual sugar/stickiness and well integrated carbonation. Smooth. For the high abv, this is a frighteningly drinkable beer. The flavour combination might not work for some, but I found it to be interesting. Definitely something that I'll look for again.

The taste is hop forward with more of the grapefruit rind, the bubblegum does come across here with just a hint of caramel on the finish.

Nice lace around the glass, too. Odors of bananas, malt and almost clover were noted. Flavor was a little to alcohol for my taste, but true to form for the style. Smooth, slightly creamy yeast and malt flavors, with a light syrup-like quality. Finished smooth, with a bubblegum like aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but could use some improvements here and there. Still a solid beer, but I really feel that the prevalence of alcohol was too strong, and took away from the overall enjoyment of this beer. Still, I must recommend this beer for fans of the style.","Frozensoul327","Aug 19, 2005"

Aroma is piney, containing a strong hop impart, highly yeasty yet intensely caramelic, woody and orangey. Ive never smelled anything like this. A great original blend of less original flavours that work in unison. Wow, thats good. More earthy orange flesh paired along with piney and foresty floral and herbal butterscotch flavours. Rather complex, but most of all hypnotizing working well together factor. Moderately carbonated, perhaps a bit thinned-out mouthfeel, but still working well.

Head isn't as resilient as most Belgian-styles, but could be the alcohol coming into play, and lacing is average. Aroma is sweet, yet citrusy, not unexpected from the name, and it meets the advertising. Taste is tart citrus upfront, which changes gears to slightly sweet malts.
