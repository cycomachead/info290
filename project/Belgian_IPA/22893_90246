It appeared a hazy, darker orange color that had a really nice, well retained, thick and dense white head.  Lighter aroma than expected, slight citrus hop.  The taste is about what you would expect from the style, malty with some citrus hop.  The beer had a really nice feel to it, extremely smooth and very easy to drink.","PhillyStyle","Jan 23, 2015"

Aroma is piney with a good amount of pineapple and some orange. Malt sweetness and hops balance pretty well but this beer is a little more subdued than I would have expected. Just researched and realized that this beer has been in the bottle for 4 months. Still a good IPA, but I would guess that it has lost a little during its time in the bottle.","hophugger","Dec 20, 2014"

Held to the light, its not haxy, just dark gold in appearance. Aroma is good,, if a little mild. Mouthfeel is outstanding.. carbonation has good balance. The hop selection is interesting. Some pine finishing with a hint of citrus. Not overly bitter, a tad more than i would normally like but no complaints here. I think the slight aftertaste may be from the yeast. Not bad at all just different. The belgian characteristics are mild and most evident in the yeast flavors. Very good and will buy again. This is a beer to savor and enjoy, not one for nonchalant drinking nights. Would make an interesting pairing with a sharp cheese and possibly italian pasta - i can really see this complimenting the flavors of garlic and oregano. Not as good as their spiral jetty (imho) but a fine beer that deserves a good try.","Curtis","Oct 14, 2013"

4.08,6.5,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"like all epic beers from this series and beyond, the use of hops in this beer is expert. it pours a fantastic bright golden color with some darker orange hues and a massive fluff white head. the nose on it is distinctly Belgian yeast, floral and supercharged, complimenting the ripe citrus hop profile of this beer. the flavor is much like the nose, with the hop presence carrying throughout the whole beer, moving from lemony to bitter very quickly, and the summer yeast keeping everything dancing. the grain bill is light, but has a graham crackery honey sweetness to it that works well with the other players. the feel is outstanding too, with electric carbonation prickling the palate, and a drinkably medium body working. the finish is bitter and yeasty, as it should be in a Belgian ipa. this to me is another genre definer from epic, everything you want in the style and nothing you don't. it should be in a museum somewhere for that reason. too many lousy versions out there, this one struck a chord with me.","StonedTrippin","May 23, 2013"

Aromas of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, pear, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and yeast notes. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, floral, grass, pepper, pine, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pear, floral, pepper, pine, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors with spicy esters; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly sticky and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian IPA. Good balance of hop and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 18, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but I don't think that a cask presentation is optimal for this beer.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 15, 2013"
3.78,-1.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.75,"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, sticky hop bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes, Belgian yeast and pale malts into a bone dry finish. Earthy, resinous and bitter with lots of dry hop flavor followed by subtle sweetness with some grapefruit and orange peel, however, the citrus/tropical fruit character isn't as strong as the nose suggests. The Belgian yeast flavors are stronger than they were in the aroma with hints of bread, apple, pear and bubblegum. Sweet malt backbone balances things out with some caramel and toffee sweetness along with bread, biscuit and graham cracker. Subtle heat in the finish but it doesn't affect the drinkability. Overall, this beer isnt anything out of the ordinary but is a pretty solid offering from Epic. The hop flavors are decent but are slightly one dimensional and overpower the Belgian yeast notes a but too much for me. Still, I enjoyed drinking this and got through the bomber pretty quickly.","corby112","Apr 13, 2013"
