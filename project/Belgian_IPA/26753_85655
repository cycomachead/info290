Delightful citrus orange on the tongue with very little pine bite back.  Very mellow.  Hints of horrible Bowman's cheap bourbon but it seriously tames the IPA into a truly delightful and drinkable beer.  Dump the Bowman's for Two Brothers and this would be the best DIPA ever.

This all varies at times throughout the bottle between working well together and missing the mark a bit.

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to beeruser and funkydelic for sharing this one at a recent tasting! Served from bottle into a Sweetwater 15th Anniversary snifter. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, earth, earth hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, earth, fruit, caramel, and vanilla. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I went into the one not really knowing what to expect if I am completely honest. However, what I found was a very pleasant all-around brew that had a nice touch of complexity on all aspects. It maintained all of this while still remaining refreshing. I probably would not have been able to guess that this one was in a bourbon barrel, or any barrel for that matter, but that didn’t change the fact that it was quite tasty. Really glad I got the opportunity to try this one with good company. Even if you don’t have the good company part, I still suggest you trying it. Tick.","thagr81us","0"
