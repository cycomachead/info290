3.93,-4.1,4,4,3.75,4.25,4,"Overall (4.00) - By far the thing they need to work on here is the taste. There is just too much fruit/lemon presence for me. It fits into the style very well though and is actually very satisfying. Though it is heavier than other belgians I've had, I attribute that character to a better body profile. Needs a slight bit of work, then this will be an excellent beer.","csparace","May 19, 2013"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with soapy and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","May 02, 2013"

The nose comprises grapefruit zest, mandarin orange, light lemon zest, sweet caramel, and a touch of pineapple. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light leek and a very small contingent of what seems like salt. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

Nice complimentary yeast that lends some esters and spice to the mix. Moderately bitter aftertaste, balancing the light sweetness upfront. A hint of malt in the middle, but this is a showcase of how well the hops and yeast dance together. Lighter feel, creamy, drying in the finish with a pleasant aftertaste of fruit and light pepper. Good stuff, will definitely look for more of before it's gone.","emerge077","0"
