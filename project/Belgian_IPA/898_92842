3.18,-14.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,3," The taste is good with slight hint of pear and slight peppery element with mild herbal flavor leading to hint of sugar and mild tinge of tropical fruit -more of a muted pineapple type presence with subtle malt and more alcohol as it finishes with good yeast flavor not as intense as the nose lets on. Overall I enjoyed this, however it is more of a hoppy triple than 'White IPA', the hops balance so Imperial Wit might not be appropriate, but it seems like just another beer trying to jump on the IPA bandwagon to sell rather than market it as a belgian wheat which might not be as popular.","Slatetank","May 18, 2014"

The aroma is reminiscent of their Loose Cannon, but slightly milder due to the wheat in the grain bill. The taste is similar. This is like Loose Cannon light which is in no way a bad thing. A little thinner on the body but a nice smooth finish. An interesting take on the IPA.","delta490","Apr 28, 2014"

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 9/2013. Pours very cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, apple, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, floral, grass, wheat, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, clove, light banana, pepper, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus peel, coriander, clove, light banana, pepper, floral, grass, wheat, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt backbone and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice White IPA! All around nice balance and complexity of hop, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jul 24, 2013"

A hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and minty pine hop in the aftertaste. A nice mix of hops, quite nice and pleasant.","OWSLEY069","Jul 13, 2013"

4.08,9.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Fresh release into Ohio from Cavalier Distributing, pours a glowing orange golden hued slightly hazed as the yeast sediment disperses like cigar smoke in the room, light white head forms leaves fine intricate layered lacing. Aromatics heavy in the pinapple, mango, tropical fruit department with heavy spice arriving 2nd, big hops underneath the label of a White IPA. Smoking a La Aroma de Cuba Mi Reserva, a cigar influence by Cuba yet produced by the Holt's Cigar Company (Philadelphia, PA) the folks who brought us Ashton, and San Cristobal. This is produced in Nicaragua by Don Pepin Garcia at the My Father Cigar Factory wrapped with a beautiful Mexican San Andres wrapper, I'm in love with the pairing. And intrigued by the fact that this beer is brewed in Baltimore yet carries IPA and witbier characteristics that have been formed from a love of West Coast IPA and Belgian artisanal ales. What a hybrid of pairings, anyways on to the flavor of the uber fresh White IPA, heavy handed citrus and tropical fruit hops with bready yeast and spice laying down the law. It leaves a lingering bitterness catching those hops and house Belgian style yeast together but leaves an impeccable complexity of tropical fruit including mango and pineapples with tones of passionfruit. The spices come off very perfumey, like walking through a women's dressing room after a hoard of single females prepare to go out for a night on the town. It catches me with some balance but the extreme contrast of flavors that appreciate in a format that turns the volume up this loud is a bit distracting from what the base beer could actually provide to the drinker without all of the background noise. I know it's a trend to blend these two styles and this isn't a horrible version of it, it is just one that I'm not so keen on. The smell is beautiful even some green onion notes from the big hop barrage makes in through to my nares, it's just the clash of Belgian yeast and spice with the IPA that leave me wanting more cohesion and less clash. Know add in the cigar with earthy wood and sweet tobacco with black pepper spice and we have ourselves a magnificent pairing. Mouthfeel is very forgiving with a dry spice lingering bitterness and floral earthy pepper notes that linger kicking in but tasting rather good between sips, the mango fruitiness is complex because it limits the concentration of malt sweetness due to the fact that it's mainly derived from the hop varieties used in this beer. Overall I'm happier with my session with this beer than the flavor description details indicated, a very fine ale from Hugh Sisson and company of Baltimore keep bangin' out these beautiful complex ales and I will keep trying them.","WVbeergeek","May 17, 2013"
