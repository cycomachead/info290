3.88,-1.8,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"One of the hoppier Belgian IPA's out there. Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into my Grape and Gourmet store tulip. Hazy apricot color with a big delicately bubbly white head. Head retention is better than average and the head looks more frothy after the bubbles die down.  Aroma is citrus and  floral hops, not much in the way of Belgian beer aspects.  Flavor adds some Belgian yeast and some light fruit to the big hoppy presence.  The yeast is fairly prominent and adds the "Belgian" to the Belgian IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp, bitter and fairly rich.  Overall, an interesting and well crafted beer.","JayQue","Feb 26, 2015"

More citrus, a touch of pine, marshmallow, and pith in the taste. Moderate carbonation yet slightly creamy mouthfeel. Some yeasty funkiness in this but not as much as I expected, well done overall beer.","Phigg1102","Jan 02, 2015"

I was very surprised with the citrus mixed with a little bit of pine taste. The Belgian yeasts adds that nice Belgian flavor and keeps you coming back. Not a session beer but a very enjoyable beer.

This beer is highly carbonated providing a big time dense white fluffy head that has big time staying power. Clear (kept the yeast in the bottle for the first pour) and light in color-straw with just a hint of golden. Aromas of hops a plenty-spicy peppery and citrus rind. Lots of that traditional Belgian yeast aroma in here too. Taste is like the aroma, lots of yeast, hops and clean malts. Upfront malty, then yeasty and finally hoppy and a bit bitter. The beer finishes quickly and is dry. As it warms on the 2nd pint the volatile alcohols come out stronger. Overall although not a style I gravitate towards, this is a well done beer with loads of malt, hops and yeast balanced in unison for a drinkable big beer.","deebo","Feb 26, 2013"

Aromas of floral hops, jasmine, and a spiciness imparted from the yeast, with a hint of honey and toasted grains. Very mild, well blended aromas. Flavors are very well blended, riding a thin, sharp body. Roasted and resiny hopped forward flavor, with a floral and bitter component as the brew crosses your tongue. Slight buttery biscuit backbone, which supports the hops profile. A touch of fruity and funky highlights can be gleamed throughout, too. Tart, fruity, and hoppy aftertaste, with the fruit taking over into the finish, along with a touch of resin and bitter. Clean, crisp finish.

The nose is of sweet bready malt, earth, and citrus with astringent, fruity notes from the Belgian yeast. This could almost double as a hoppy saison. On the palate, fruity notes up front with an astringent feel through the middle. Earthy notes and some light fruit (apple) come out in the finish before a mild citric bitterness. A little bit of spice dots the landscape. Medium body with a bit of a prickly feel. Solid flavor throughout with a decent dose of bitterness. Well-balanced.

The taste holds notes of banana peel, lemon rind, orange rind, light orange zest, very light clove, melon, grass, and a few pinches of brown sugar and nutmeg.

3.95,0,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into an Allagash stem glass, this IPA was a slightly hazy amber color with a frothy puff of white head that retained well and left some decent lacing. Brilliant aroma of herbal and citrus hops, and a cornucopia of fresh fruit. As it approached my lips, I actually got the sensation of a West Coast IPA. Hops and more hops, grassy and citric, orange blossom and honey, all overlaid on a solid sweet malt base. Mellows out towards the end and leaves a nice dry finish. Medium mouthfeel, and quite the quaffable IPA. Goes great with food.","Rifugium","Oct 10, 2011"

It is like it has a very subtle wild character, but not enough to contribute anything but an anomaly in the flavor. That said, it is probably just an earthy hops that I am misinterpreting or something.

A murky golden orange with very thick foam and a bitter citrus smell. I was pretty excited. But after my first sip, I realized something was a little off. The bitterness I smelled turned into a round, sour taste. Not sharp sour like a flemish sour ale, but round sour, like old milk. I'm not sure if I just got a bad bottle, or if this was their intention, but it didn't work for me. The orange and citrus notes redeemed it enough to make it drinkable, but there was something acrid about the taste that really put me off.

Citrusy and sharp, but with musty earth underpinnings, yeasty and doughy all at once. A pretty darn tasty combination.

3.85,-2.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is what I don't like about Belgian IPAs. The styles of Belgian beers used for the platform for the bittering and flavoring hops are delicate beers to begin with. They are actually tripels with very subtle flavor characteristics that end up completely overwhelmed by bitterness. This beer is no exception. When I drink a beer like this I think, "what would this beer be like without the hops?" Probably a Belgian Strong Pale, another beer that is not known for its over the top malt character or fruity spiciness but a clean bright flavor. The hop bitterness is what is most present in this beer. The citrus flavors (almost orange peel) is present in the mid and some in the front. There is moderate to mild sweetness at the front, but overall the hops mask almost everything. This beer is bright and bitter. Drinkability moderate, mouthfeel is fine.

A little head's-up on the bottle would have been nice. Having said that, the hop character, though pronounced doesn't give the bitterness or the hop flavor/aroma that classic Belgian hoppy beers do, like DeRank XX, Poppering's, or Houblon. The hops are tucked in right behind the Dubbel or Belgian amber ale maltiness. Those malts are very well attenuated, firm, soft, creamy, rich, and never leaves any residual sugars on the palate. Confection-like sweetness evaporates in the mouth and makes the beer increadibly drinkable. Fruity, rum-soaked peaches, pears, berries, apples, and appricots give the beer a lot of direction. Figs, pecans, and dates also contribute a richness that go along with a light maple syrup flavor. Finishes with an earthy, pungent, hop-herbal note that flirts with the candied malts well into the finish.

Nice aromas of piney hops and some malty sweetness as well as the typical Belgian yeast.

The taste is even more on point with piney, spicy hops, some mellow sweetness that serves to underscore the hops, and that nice yeasty, Belgian tang. A tiny bit prickly in the throat, but with a touch of lingering sweetness to counterbalance this. Just delicious on tap. Alcohol? What alcohol?","Georgiabeer","0"

Don't go into this expecting it to taste like every other IPA you've tried -- it's got its own taste and is definitely worth a try.

The hops are present, but they take a backseat to the "Belgian pale ale" flavor. There is a mild bitterness that really reveals itself in the finish, but I'm not that impressed with it. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a flop by Allagash. I've had hybris style beers like this before, but this one falls flat.

There is a goodly amount of lacing too. The carbonation doesn't quit, with the little fizzy bubbles streaming to the top well after the pour. The smell is very subdued and not very enticing. I little more dry hopping could have brought something out in this department, but alas no, and what you get are some very subtle sweet malts, candied sugars, some alcohol notes, and maybe some fruits. It smells like a weak trippel or Belgian blonde. The taste is sweet malts again, medium bodied, creamy consistency, a little pepperish snap in there, but it fades as the beer warms. There is a malty, caramel flavor more than anything else that I detect. There might be some currant flavors, but they are pretty far down on the taste-o-meter. There is a slightly lingering aftertaste, but not from the hops, more from the candied sugars and the yeasts. If you let it hang on the tongue for awhile, you might get some pine resin hoppiness, but you have to really search for it.

3.42,-13.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,3,"I think that a lot of the fruitiness of this beer comes from the hops; interestingly enough the Simcoe does not taste as it does in an IPA. Some how it is much greener, not nearly as citrus-like (though that is here) and quite herbaceous. I am curios if a Belgian-type yeast strain was used here; there are definitely some phenolics & higher alcohols that could be attributed to this, or it could be some combination of warmer fermentation temperatures, alcohol and green hop notes (though I wouldn't guess so). This is certainly not nearly as hoppy as I was expecting given the description on the bottle, but it is still a nice beer that has some really interesting flavors (the wood-like almost bourbon notes are really interesting considering neither of those were involved in the making of this beer.

Lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. The smell was very hoppy, which quite shocked me at first. There was the underlying base of yeast, and your typical tripel smell, but above that was this huge aroma of citrus hops, lots of orange peel and sweet tangerine aromas. Now this is what I'm talking about. The taste was superb. Lots of west coast hops in the back. Well forst great feel, smooth, light and great carbonation. Went down real easy and had the slightly fizzy feel that really makes the flavors pop. Nice bread and yeast tones, earthy grains made up the backbone of this one. Then interwovern were extremly frsh cut hops. Very nice orange and grapefruit tones. Very upfront too. The mixture of these gave it a very unique flavor I had not seen before. I actually enjoyed this much more then the other Belgian IPA I have tried. I felt there was much more hoppiness to this one. Overall this was a great great beer.

On the palate, it's surprisingly light and quite citrusy, with a metallic edge that's pure hops. Light, graham cracker malts form the backbone for the beer. Big sweetness first off, featuring those lightly caramelly malts, but the hops present themselves throughout with that Simcoe "sweet tropical fruit flavors with underlying bitterness" character. Mouthfeel is quite full with carbonation -- almost overly so -- with very little in the way of alcoholic burn. Overall, this is an excellent Belgian IPA. The Simcoe hops provide for some very soft bitterness, which goes very well with the Belgian style malts and overall lesser emphasis on hop bitterness.

3.63,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a very nice amber brown color, with decent head and lacing. Not a lot in the nose, maybe some spice and citrus. On the palate the beer tastes like your rather typical Belgium brown ale, with a bit more hoppiness then normal. This was a nice enough beer, but I have to say it seemed a bit simple and one dimensional. I am surprised to see it characterized as a Belgium IPA, as the hops were not very noticeable and there was very little hoppy citrus flavor. Nevertheless, this was a pretty tasty beer, but probably not one I'll order again any time soon.","John_M","Apr 29, 2007"

2.72,-31.1,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a very murky orange color with a medium head of tan/off white bubbles. Aroma is very yeasty and bready with only a hint of citrus and pineapple(?). Taste is a bit oaky is this barrel aged? Yeast dominates the flavor profile. Reminds me of drinking a homebrew that was bottled too early. Hops and malt are nearly completely hidden under all the yeast, and this was not a vigorous pour. In the background, you can detect and presence of simcoe hops and some malty sweetness. Mild bitterness, again distracted by the yeast. If you have one, I would recommend ageing a bit. Right now, it is a mess.","sacfly","Beers"
4.13,4.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured in a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2" beige head over the cloudy orangey amber brew. Head actually grows initially, fueled by vigorous bubbling from deep in the glass, lacing meringuey and sticky. Aroma is lightly of piney hops, with some spicy yeast adding to the show. Taste is relatively balanced, and while the moderate hoppiness is a constant throughout, in the door we find some delicate malt sweetness, coupled with light fruitiness in the middle. The hops character returns for the close to slowly but surely return to the bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost seems a bit thin, and drinkability is nice and easy. Nothing over the top here hopwise, but constructed nicely with everything working well together, which is always appreciated.","ppoitras","0"
