As soon as I took my first swig, I got that aftershave bite that I associate with tripels.  Sorry, but I am not a big fan.  However, that said, I am not going to judge this beer simply on the fact that I don't like tripels.  The Spacewalker was served to me on tap, and it had a nice amber-gold color with a lovely but quickly dissipating white head.  The smell was of rich spices mixed with aftershave, the taste being extremely similar.  However, it was also fairly smooth, and I could quickly forgive the awful aftershave aftertaste.  I won't be having this again, but it was worth a try just to say I won't.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Nov 27, 2014"

Weird thing is, I don't usually care for standard Hefe's or Wit's, but when those flavors are put together into a beer like this, I find it truly outstanding.

I'm definitely glad I bought a 4 pack of this and I look forward to having more of these over the next few weeks. Easily drinkable with a well hidden alcohol but I find it's more of a savoring beer rather than one to be drank quickly. The hops are strong enough that they'll slow you down.","damndirtyape","Aug 03, 2014"

Nose of bittering hops, light bread, light clove, light candy malt, and light banana from the Belgian yeast. Taste is almost a cross between a farm house ale, a triple, and a bitter ipa. Hops up front, VERY light sweetness from candy sugars, and light clove hidden amongst bittering hops. Mouthfeel is on the high side of moderate carbonation with a citrusy dry aftertaste. I would personally like to try this in a bottle to compare notes. It misses the mark from the highs of triple dog dare which was true to the mark. This is a hoppy mess. I am sorry, but as a lover of Belgian style ales the over abundance of hops wrecks this brew. A shame since I am such of a fan of this brewery.","Brutaltruth","Aug 02, 2014"

Aroma hits that great balance of yeasty fruitiness and spicy (rather peppery in this case) phenols. This smells like many good abbeys and other Belgians I've had. The initial taste is a high hoppy bitterness, with earthy, grassy hop notes--after, a candy sweetness, light summer fruitiness, and lots of clovey, spicy phenols. The hoppiness lasts through to the bitter, dry finish. The body is light despite the strength, well-attenuated, and spritzy with carbonation. Highly good Belgian style!","allengarvin","Jul 30, 2014"

Pours fairly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/floral hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast spice/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel, banana, pear, apple, bubblegum, clove, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of citrus/pine hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and pale malt flavors; with a nice malt/yeast/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good hoppy Belgian pale ale. All around good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 25, 2014"
