It's seems like a upgraded 'Blue Moon' the balance is off. Leaves a spicy aftertaste... Like maybe soap and/or tea. On the other hand. It's creamy and light.

This would have gotten a considerably higher rating if not for the appearance, but as previously stated that will come done to personal opinion. (3.58)","Grugalug","Sep 07, 2014"

Pours hazy/murky deep gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of bright grapefruit, lemon peel, tangerine, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus hops, fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of bright grapefruit, lemon peel, tangerine, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy spiciness/hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon peel, tangerine, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus hops, fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice white IPA! All around good balance and complexity of bright citrus hops, fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and pale malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

Nose is typical of a Belgian IPA - citrus, spice and zest. Taste follows nose - no surprises here. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, slightly coarse carbonation and a mild acidity.

3.88,6,2.75,4,4.25,3,3.75,"This is really "Brewmaster Mike Gerhart's Fresh Slice White IPA", but I am not going to request a change. Instead, I am CANducting a Crack! and inverted Glug in Mr. Gerhart's honor. He may have forgotten to mention that it is unfiltered, but I will not hold it against him (by much). The trick with an inverted Glug is knowing when to back off to allow the pseudo-cascade to take place and I certainly know that one. The result was a soapy, rocky, two fingers of off-white head that burped and burst its way out of existence, leaving behind great lacing in its wake. The resulting liquid was a deeply cloudy, intensely turbid golden-yellow (SRM = 4-5), like freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. Nose smelled of white pepper and orange zest and I was drooling in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very tea-like, orange pekoe, to be precise. Spicy, peppery, and with a pleasant orange zestiness, all dancing across my tongue in a harmonized ballet. The finish was dry and citrusy and I CANnot think of a better summertime beer to put in a CAN. Thanks for thinking of me!","woodychandler","Jun 19, 2014"

The yeast/protein floaties I understand, but they are still just a turnoff for me. I would overlook them more if the beer packed more of a belgian punch, or an IPA punch for that matter.

3.56,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured into a bell tulip, a cloudy, golden-yellow color with a finger of frothy white head that settled to a foamy layer; good retention and lacing. In the nose, Belgian yeast and coriander came at me first, bready malts and light citrus zest followed. This brew really came off more as a witbier to me, but I guess it was hoppy enough to be considered a BIPA. As in the aroma, I got a lot of yeast and spice in the taste, coriander, orange peel, light crisp hops that were present, but never really reached over the dominating "wit" character. Medium body, and nice drinkability. Overall, this was a good brew, but I probably wouldn't get it again unless there were no better options available to me.","Rifugium","Apr 24, 2014"

The hops don't bring a lot to the taste when cold but do have herbal and zesty quality which I can understand that they are going for a grapefruit, however the yeast overwhelms the hop flavor. Overall I liked this, but it is not the best in the style IMO, pretty drinkable for the strength, but wish it had more hop flavor.","Slatetank","Apr 15, 2014"

The taste is tangerine, cloves, coriander, and that Belgian yeast. Light hop notes with hints of bananas. Not really getting much of the "IPA" aspect of this one, but it's not a bad brew. Medium bodied and pretty drinkable. Of the recent run of new(er) Otter Creek beers this is probably my least favorite, but it's not a bad beer by any stretch. Just a bit disappointing since Double Dose, Kind Ryed, and Citra Mantra were all fantastic. I heard this is being canned so I think that will work well in the summer.
