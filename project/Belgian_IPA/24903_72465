4.22,-2.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"22oz corked and caged bottle shared at Beachwood BBQ #bottlecherwednesday. Poured into a tulip, this beer is cloudy orange-yellow with a finger or so of white foam that settles to a thin layer that’s retained for the duration. Lots of sticky lace rings and streaks are left behind. A very complex aroma includes citrus and tropical fruit, brett funk, acidic white wine, oak, some caramel malt, and a little vanilla. The flavors are just as layered, with a great interplay between sweet and sour bolstered by bitter underpinnings. Yeasty, funky, citrusy, oaky, and vinous. Very enjoyable to sip and savor. Medium body, a bit creamy in texture, lively carbonation, drying, puckering, long finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 05, 2015"

The gauziness to the liquid teases out some deepening orange hues to the base yellow, not many bubbles, somewhat flat visual appearance. The nose has a fresh directness to it, white grapefruit energizing pear, apple, and peach fruit scents, only lightly herbal, salt and pepper, dried bread crust, has a sourness to it and cleaner than expected, zips in and zips out. Medium-bodied, the carbonation never quite catches so it stays soft and does not percolate as it might otherwise. Cinnamon, nutmeg sprinkled on top of pear, apricot, peach, pineapple fruit. The white grapefruit, lemon citrus by far the most aggressive element, and here the grassiness turned up a notch, contributes to its overall sourness. Floral, notes of quinine and saline. Becomes more dry through the finish, has earthiness but, again, of a clean nature, no real funk. Glides well and there’s no rough spots at all. About as quaffable as one might expect from such a brew.","farrago","Feb 08, 2014"

Vinous, woody and herbal flavors plus light acetic component emerges midsip and dominates the finish. Medium bodied, light start then a prickly carbonation, finishing bitter, bretty, and dry.

Aroma of Brett, white wine, apple, light citrus and light grassy hops. Flavor is also distinctive Brett, lemon, tangerine, stone fruit, mildly vinous, light coriander; finishes very dry with Brett and lingering hop bitterness with no distinct hop flavor. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. The yeast strain here leans more towards a saison yeast than Belgian, but there are light Belgian yeast and spicing elements present in the complex flavor. This is almos too dry for me, but the complexity of the flavor really made this enjoyable to drink. Dryness and light vinousness gives it a champagne like character, if champagne had Brett.

I'm a fan of brett and this beer, a Belgian IPA with brett, is definitely dominated by the funkiness. It's missing the harsh, leathery aspects of a lot of other brett beers and is instead light and fluffy. The color is amazing, bright and straw-colored. So unbelievably tasty, with rich citrus flavors, a bit of oakiness, but mostly that brett. Even at $15/bottle I would gladly have as many as I could drink.","falc0n2600","Sep 23, 2013"

After trying a year-old Galaxy White IPA and now this four month old Bitter Monk, I'm glad to say that Anchorage are single-handedly providing a reason for that terrible mishmash of styles known as a "Belgian IPA" to exist. The flavor profile is nearly perfect, the Brett and the slight butteriness from the Chardonnay barrels do very interesting things with the heavy fruity hopping and oak. Lightly sour at first, some more influence from the hops quickly rushes in, with the yeast and oak providing a strong backbone for the finish. Much like the Galaxy White IPA, the mouthfeel is extremely dry because of the whole brett + lots of hops thing. An exceptional beer. Anchorage's Belgian IPAs are so good, they make everybody else trying the style look like amateurs. As good as the style gets.","shand","Beers"

I like my DIPAs to be a bighter color than the typical burnt orange/ haziness of many and this beer has a beautiful sunshine yellow/ brassy hue w/ ridiculous head retention (I'm talking over an hour and there was still a rim on my friends glass). But the smell of this beer is truly heavenly for a hop head, it starts out with that brett sour apple turning into barnyard scent which is then replaced by grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, hop phenols and finishes with a hit of oaky leather. The taste is just as good brett flavors are forward with a center of this beer is pure hoppy goodness, with a lingering barrel finish that is very very dry. This dryness was amazing for the taste but did hurt the feel of the beer slightly and it could have been more carbonated (the top did fly off though...) all in all hard to find fault with this one a great beer that really is proud to represent the style of Belgian IPA, god Gabe is good....","oceanman907","Sep 07, 2013"

I just love the combination of bitter and sour in this beer. You know there is sweetness there too, otherwise the beverage would be undrinkable, but it's buried under the other flavors.

There is a lot of carbonation in the form of aggressive, tiny bubbles, but that didn't bother me in terms of drinkability. Medium body that is never syrupy which can be an issue in double IPAs. Flavor has orange and lemon peel, spices (couldn't mistake this for anything but a belgian beer), brett yeast, and still a bit of pine/resin. It is quite dry, and absolutely delicious.

The 9% is well hidden but the strong flavors attack the palate. I think this drinks like a Citra DIPA vs a Saison. You absolutely get the Chardonnay as it warms. I get the hop punch on the front end but it fades into the orange/spice notes. I'm sure some of this has to do with the nearly year old bottle but it held up magnificently.

It's big on pineapple, mango, guava, raspberry and tangerine. Just a mouth-watering fruitiness. The brett funk blends in nicely, contributing some funk and probably helping some of the fruit aroma. Some earthier tones are also in there. The taste is relatively dry with a mild to medium bitter finish. That said, there's still some nice light malt sweetness, which allows the hop flavors to shine. Feel is soft and light. There's some prickle from the hops, but it's still a smooth rich beer. Bitter Monk is another excellent beer from Anchorage, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.","popery","Oct 21, 2012"

Funky wild yeast with some tropical and citrus fruits. Nice pineapple with some orange and lovely hoppiness. The more I let my nose get familiar with this beer, the more french oak and chardonnay I get. Very complex. I could sniff this beer all day. Taste is initially tart with some white grapes and tart green apples. Some citrus and tropical fruit flavors...wow, just wow. A hint of butter. The hops, fruit, oak, and chardonnay flavors blend so well with a subtle funkiness that just makes me wonder how this beer will taste after the Brett works its magic over time. Gotta grab another bottle to sit on. So much complexities going on here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice bite, yet slightly chewy. Drinkability is very high for almost 10%. Alcohol is present, but not very much so. Overall, this is just another great beer from a brewery I have grown very fond of over the last year. I have yet to find an Anchorage beer I didn't think was good.","DovaliHops","Sep 15, 2012"

The brew poured with a gigantic head, about three fingers of pure white head that was thick and fluffy and left lots of lacing on the glass. The body was a clear, almost straw yellow with lots of active carbonation visible. I thought the color was pretty light for a Belgian IPA. The nose was all brett…not that I’m unhappy with that. It’s been awhile since I’ve had a brett beer. Wow, this was really different. The brew started with a bit of grapefruit and tart citrus with a bit of barnyard funk from the brett. It was really light (body-wise) for a Belgian IPA and the booze and IBUs are really well-balanced out by the flavors. The finish was relatively quick with a hint of citrus. The body was probably the lightest that I’ve ever had with a good dollop of carbonation. This beer was just fantastic to me. It was an easy drinker despite the ABV and was complex and quaffable.

The aroma is nothing short of incredible and fascinating! The multi-layered hop scents, lemon, kiwi, and clove, all married to the brett/yeast earthy notes, wine-like characteristics, and a creamy hint to it make this one of the best smelling beers I have ever taken a whiff of. Taste - WOW! Not to be taken lightly this beer begins with the earthy brett, and quickly the piny hops jump in as well. The finish is pleasantly bitter with the flavor of the wine barrel revealing itself. The body and mouthfeel are not too overpowering, and it's got, I'd say a 7 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of alcohol heat. I am enjoying the warming sensations and pleasant buzz right away. Overall, the beer's a rare treat not to be missed. Top shelf- buy with confidence.

4.5,4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to RSVP in Portland, Maine I was able to give this classy brew a try. It's a very cloudy yellowish tan colored brew with a solid white head and tons of lacing. The aroma is an unparelleled yeasty medley that includes slightly skunky lemon wheat highlights and subtle clove. Very impressive, classy and kind of unique. The flavor happily falls right in place with the aroma. Clovey nuances over wheat with sweet, near bubblegum hops. Wow, just so tasty with mild banana-lemon and tons of yeasty zest. Just delicious and oozing quality and delight! Finely carbonated but with a full, luscious feel. As advertized this is a real winner if you're any kind of fan of this style. I can agree with some of the other reviewers that this may not be a classic Belgian IPA, but to me that's a good thing. I really like more of the American-Belgian hybrid and perhaps that is somewhat the case here. I'm not enough of an expert to say, but i do know I love this stuff.","Durge","May 09, 2012"

Bitterness is a bit much, but afterall.. it is in the name. Interesting beer for sure.","oriolesfan4","May 08, 2012"
3.75,-13.2,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O - Good, but not great. I was expecting more of the brett and belgian aspects to stand in the forefront, but the IPA and bitterness is what leads from the beginning. No real detection of the oak or chardonnay. However, I would certainly like to toss one in the cellar for a while just to see how it changes over time. Plus, I did seem to enjoy it more as I worked through the bottle...","mrandypandy","May 08, 2012"

Yes I am a sucker but this really is quite a good beer. Bright yellow orange color and a huge rocky head, looks good. The smell instantly reminded me of Russian River Temptation, heavy Chardonnay and brett. I think there was a hint of citrus in there as well. The flavor again made me think of Temptation and it must be that Chardonnay and brett combo working so well. There is a bit of bitterness in here from the hops and just the faintest hint of citrus. I have to wonder what the hops were like when this was fresh since this was apparently brewed back in July of 2011 but the hops are not completely gone.

4.5,4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a hazy golden yellow, we split the yeast amongst us and its sat 'curtain-like' in each of our glasses in suspension. Looked pretty cool! Voluminous white head, very effervescent with a great rocky head and spotty lacing. Nose has pungent lemon, funk/brett, white wine notes, pine, a touch of cat pee, citrus zest and background tropical notes (derived from the Citra I'll guess). Alot of grassy notes as well, somewhat of a Noble hop character to it. Certainly extremely unique for a DIPA. Taste again has substantial lemon, tropical fruits with light tart and vinous/barrel notes. Herbal hops again with less brett than the nose. Light spiciness in the finish, certainly a solid amount of Belgian and brett flavours all around - works phenomenally with the hop profile. Bitterness is there but not overpowering. Fantastic, and I'll most certainly seek out future batches if given the chance.","liamt07","Feb 06, 2012"

I can confidently say this is one of the most unique beers that I've had in a VERY long time, superbly brewed and considering the unique complexity dare I say "superbly engineered"? This beer isn't for everyone, it's adventurous, but if you really dig super dry Belgian beers with brett funk and you enjoy intense citrus bitterness from Citra hops, this is a must try.

A nice bright white billowy foamy head of foam graces the top leaving droppings on the glass, sheets even. Smell is heavenly, the brett is right up there and fills the nostrils. Citrus hop aroma is amped up as well as lemon. The char does not really come through. Some bubblegum scent wit some integration. On first sips I can tell this is big beer, it's bold, bitter and somewhat abrasive without going overt the hill. Lemon, citra hop flavor, grapefruit, brett make up the flavor profile. I don't get any char and the oak is faint, if there at all. The lemon and bitterness last for a while afterwards. BOLD. Feel is a healthy medium with a whole lot of carb that sparks. This beer causes tingles on my tounge. A great beer that delivers on everything on the bottle, sand huge barrel flavor, yet drinking this now, too much of that may have killed what make this stand out.","BARFLYB","Nov 29, 2011"

This is a fantastic beer and I'm glad I tried it even though I paid $25 for the bomber at a bar. Heck it was thanksgiving and I couldn't resist!

4.58,6,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"This brew lives up to the billing: it is tremendously bitter, and heavily Belgianesque in character. Bitter Monk pours a surprisingly pale translucent golden hue, topped with a very healthy white cap of rocky froth. The nose is pungently bitter with notes of heavy grapefruit pith and elderflower being highly prominent. The bitter apple-pineapple flavor imparted by the brett pairs well with the hop addition, as they mimic one another's flavor in some ways. I keep thinking this is very much like Cantillon's Mamouche - or like an elderflower IPA. The pale malt base is evocative of the classic Orval or Duvel approach; there is no caramel to be found here. The mouthfeel is quite effervescent, and thereby bordering on prickly; though it is not offensive, I'd have preferred a softer feel. That said, in every way this is a challenging, ass-kicking type of beer, so the feel is in that vein as well. A very good example of the style; probably the best I've had.","ktrillionaire","Nov 20, 2011"

Slightly alcoholic on the backside, perhaps even a little medicinal.Could stand to sit for a bit, but this isnt your average early/young overly hopped IIPA. This is something else entirely. While not hot, the 9% isn’t helping build this into a better beer.Body and mouthfeel are moderate.Finish is a little acidic, make that more than a little.

3.49,-19.2,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Don't be fooled this is all sour starts light and refreshing great mouth . The flavor of hops come in, I'm not able to distinguish which overall finish bitter earthiness.","bishopdc0","Oct 16, 2011"
4.47,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Super Friends set a high mark to equal for Brett IPA's, but Bitter Monk is another candidate for the IPA Hall Of Fame. If you see this, get it, you will enjoy it for sure.","cavedave","Oct 15, 2011"
3.68,-14.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: Good. Kind of all over the place, though interesting. I personally dont think brett sits well within an IPA. You might disagree.","zoolzoo","Beers"
4.92,13.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"T - I dunno what to say. I was expecting greatness from this beer and it more than delivered. Cheers to Anchorage Brewing company for doing something completely out of the box.","OutFox","0"

4.75,10,5,5,5,4.5,4,"Pricey, I mean, the beer just nailed it, but still half point deduction for the price.","Beerandraiderfan","Oct 10, 2011"
4.72,9.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Bottom line: One of the best new beers I've had in 2011, and instantly makes me want to buy more Anchorage beer.","kkipple","Oct 06, 2011"
4.2,-2.8,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall: Fantastic aroma and a good flavor. The price tag is hefty, but if you split the cost with someone it's worth a try. ","HopHead84","Oct 05, 2011"

3.49,-19.2,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall- Good beer. I can see why everyone is loving this. I don't know if the Belgian IPA style is really my thing. Maybe it is the brett that is turning me off slightly. 3.5/5","MADhombrewer","Oct 04, 2011"
4.62,6.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is a very exciting beer, and I would buy it again without a doubt.","UnknownKoger","Oct 04, 2011"
4.25,-1.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Unique beer. Worth a shot if you have a spare 15 bucks or so. Great to share, celebrate with, or just enjoy being challenged with in your spare time. I will most likely be checking out Anchorage's other offerings if I can find them. This was a pretty impressive first.","chodinheaven","Oct 03, 2011"
4.3,-0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden amber with a two finger pillowy white head that sticks around for a while and leaves a large amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is strong brett funk, some lemon zest, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. Pretty awesome. You can definitely tell there is some citra used. The initial taste has a hint of sweetness with some funky oak flavors and lemon zest. Then the pineapple and mango come through. The finish has a good bitterness with some brett funk. The finish is quite dry. Overall a really smooth beer. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Awesome beer. It was a bit pricey ($14 for 750ml), but I think it is definitely worth trying at that price. Reminded me of a hopped up version of Orval.","jethrodium","Oct 02, 2011"
4.12,-4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: Quite the unique beer and probably the only 'IPA' I have had that actually improved with barrel aging. I'd buy it again.","Neffbeer","Oct 02, 2011"
4.32,0,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O-This is the second Anchorage beer I've had now, and it's another winner. I'm liking what these guys are doing.","DaveHS","Oct 02, 2011"

4.47,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beer is medium to light in body and has this great midpalate arrangement of hops and yeast character, mild funk, some oak on the back, moderately dry finish, a great beer overall.","drabmuh","Sep 30, 2011"
4.53,4.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One seriously slamming beer from this brewery what can I say. They are making some dam good beer up in Alaska.","smakawhat","Sep 29, 2011"

4.45,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a fantastic Belgian IPA. I still can't believe the contrast between the nose and taste, but both deliver in their own ways. I anticipate good things from this brewery. While I'm curious how the brett will treat Bitter Monk, I would drink now to experience the bright citrus/grapefruit bitterness.","Verecund","Sep 22, 2011"
4.35,0.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very impressiive Belgian style IPA. I still prefer the mischief from bruery, but this is right up there.","John_M","Sep 22, 2011"
4.72,9.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"O: I'm stunned by this beer. It is truly a beer to search for and an instant classic for me. I dare say I wouldn't mind aging a bottle for a year or more as well to see if that brett changes things things over time. Epic.","flannelman808","Sep 21, 2011"
4.5,4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I loved this beer. A lot of character and personality in every sip. Anchorage Brewing is doing a lot of things right.","Monkeyknife","Sep 15, 2011"
4.4,1.9,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Certainly the most unique DIPA I've tasted. Flavor is much more rounded out than a typical hop bomb. The hops are certainly present, but collaborate with all the flavor brought on by the brett and multiple fermentations.","brotherloco","Sep 11, 2011"
4.66,7.9,5,4,5,5,4.5,"O: A stunner of a beer. The second beer I've had from Anchorage and the second home run as well. The brewer's talent seems incredible. The grapefruit segment I described in the flavor could be a happy accident but that just seems too uncanny to be chance. This beer was designed to be that way and that just might be the most impressive thing about it. I don't like Belgian IPA's. It doesn't matter this time though because Bitter Monk is in a league of it's own. Find me a valid comparison. I don't believe it exists. 4.5/5","hopsbreath","Sep 11, 2011"
4.08,-5.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"O - Nice since the yeast wasn't overpowering. Another winner for Anchorage brewing.","HuskyinPDX","Aug 26, 2011"
4.54,5.1,5,3.5,5,5,4.5,"O: Going forward, I don't think there are any other breweries whose releases I am more interested in and excited about these days. This beer is incredibly tasty and unlike anything else I've ever tried.","ChaseT","Beers"
4.2,-2.8,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"If I could change this beer, I would tone down the bitterness overall, and the dry/bitter finish. But it is called the Bitter Monk, so it is what is says it is. The abrasive and penetrating bitterness lingers. But the complexity and balance is admirable if not amazing. Unless you absolutely loath brett, belgian yeast, or grapefruit rind bitterness, it would be crazy not to try this. Shelton Bros distributes it, so it should be widely available.","sprucetip","0"
