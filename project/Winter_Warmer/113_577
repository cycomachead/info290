3.99,8.7,4.75,3.75,4,4,4,"O: Definitely not my favorite from Sam Smith, but overall a great seasonal beer that is downright sessionable and a must try. I could definitely sit in a pub and throw back a few of these before realizing how much I'd had. Good blend of flavors, and an absolutely exquisite looking beer. It isn't outstanding in anyway outside of the look, but overall it is a very solid addition. Haven't had a bad beer from Samuel Smith's yet. Even with a beer such as this that isn't as enjoyable as others, it's still damn good.","Jaysauras","Feb 25, 2015"

4.31,17.4,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured a clear amber red body with a one finger bubbly white head. A very nice looking ale, a nice gem. Scents of caramel, light molasses, fruity esters, mostly apple, sweet spices, with notes of cinnamon most apparent, rich, sweet bready malt, a very slight alcohol presence, some light aromas of white grape raisins. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, sweet winter ale in the English tradition. Malty, spicy, slightly fruity and quite pleasant. Flavor begins malty and Iightly sweet, with notes of caramel, light levels of sweet spices, balanced by the slight bitterness of earthy and herbal Fuggle and Golding hops. Middle picks up in dryness a bit, with notes of sweet spices, the same hop character, rich caramel malt, apple, rich bready malt. Finish is lightly dry, with the same hop character continuing, alongside light notes of apple and bready malt, with a slight mustiness like a good traditional English old ale. Aftertaste is bready, rich malt and nice English hop bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully balanced ale, striking nicely between Malta and hops, with malt dominating, but hops always present and keeping the beer from being overly sweet. An excellent example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and the slightly chalky feel that many of Samuel Smith's ales have from the Yorkshire water. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice, drinkable winter ale, not too thick nor too thin. Perfectly balanced. Overall this is N excellent winter warmer, easily the best I have sampled. It has a wonderfully malty aroma and an amazingly balanced flavor, aided by a traditionally English mouthfeel. A good example of an English winter ale and well worth drinking.","Auraan","Feb 19, 2015"

3.54,-3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pours medium amber producing 2+ fingers of beige, somewhat lasting, frothy head that recedes to a nice cap but leaves almost no lace. Aroma is caramel malt & fruity, lightly buttered biscuit, spices, a hint of roast & floral hops. Taste is fruity & caramel malt (caramel candy apple), biscuit & spices up front with sweet caramel malt, butter, toasted bread, hints of roasted nuts, orange & herbal hops in the finish. Bitterness develops lightly after mid-sip, intensifying into the aftertaste where it begins to fade. Produces a spicy, lightly roasted & bitter aftertaste. Alcohol presence is minimal in the nose & mouth but is more prominent in the mouth especially in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth, tongue coating, slightly oily & chewy. This is quite tame compared with some the American craft Winter Warmers being offered. Strongly reminds me of what might be called robust British pale ale. It certainly has the buttery character I have come to expect from British pale ales.","mothmanscott","Jan 26, 2015"

3.58,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and i thought it was a solid example of the style, it wasn't nearly as spiced as most American Winter Warmer's and while that did help make it more drinkability, it also made the taste a little more bland than it could be.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, pretty creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is my limit, anymore than that and I would start to get bored with it, but it does drink smooth.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, when it came to the taste and aroma it seemed like the English Ale yeast was a little too dominating.  I don't think I would buy this again, but I wouldn't turn one down, there's just many more Winter Warmers that I would rather have.  I can't say I would really recommend this beer, but if your really into English Ales it might be worth a try.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love, I feel like it needs a little bit of work, but it does have some potential , there were some things I liked and some that I did not.  This isn't a favorite for this brewery and it falls about in the middle for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a solid ale, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Jan 19, 2015"

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, apple, fig, date, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, apple, fig, date, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, apple, fig, date, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English pale ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 21, 2014"

The gingerbread and allspice notes give way to a subtly fruity undercurrent.  On the palate, there's a good amount of the caramel and biscuit malt flavors, but they're accompanied by an earthy flavor of hops with notes of subtle citrus and grass.  The subtly builds with raspberry and red fruit flavors joining in.  The body is moderate, slightly carbonated, and slightly bright and bitter.  The ending is clean, with earth, fruit, and spice subtly vanishing.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 24, 2014"

Nice nose of caramel malt, a bit of biscuit and a classic mineral note.  Slightly above light medium body with a smooth texture.  Excellent carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout.  The crisp, well constructed, flavor profile is intense, balanced and complex.  It begins with toasty biscuit that flows to caramel sweetness.  The middle effervesces nicely into a Goldings flavored medium bitterness over a distinct mineral note.  The crisp finish effervesces nicely into a somewhat dry slow fade that leaves you with a nice bit of bitter hop flavor over a biscuit sweetness with hints of citrus and dark fruit. As everything fades away, the mineral note dominates over a slight pepper like note of spice.","tillmac62","Nov 04, 2014"

I used to pick up the bomber or two and have one on the solstice day to bring it on in. This year I waited a few days because of various reasons. Nevertheless I was turned on to this beer over a decade ago by a good friend who loved it dearly. On to the review. What a pretty beer this is, it pours a beautiful toffee color. The head remains pretty well intact over the several minutes I gave it to settle. The smell is of Christmas candies and malt, very little hop character shows up in this one. I am a hop fiend if you didn't already guess, but I do like this one for reasons unbeknownst to me. The taste is very similar to the aroma, it has a nice thick sweet mouth feel, almost cloying, but not. It takes you to the edge but reels you back in at the last minute. Overall, I do have a special place in my heart for this one and it brings back a certain time in my life where things were better than I ever would have realized they were while living them. Nevertheless, I do not oversell this one, it is a good beer and one to search out to warm you on those long winter nights that could very well last for years.","humuloner22","Feb 10, 2014"

3.81,3.8,5,4,3.75,3,3.75,"The beer pours a deep golden-orange color, with a big fat and sudsy head of off-white bubbles that leave sticky tendrils of lacing on the glass. The head has a great lasting retention that I expect from such a beer, and the beer overall looks like a classic “ale,” if that makes any sense. The beer’s body is gorgeously clear, and it really sits in the glass as a pretty sight to see. On the nose, the beer smells of sweet malt, almost like apple-juice with a touch of vinous, white wine thrown in. Soft, minerally scents mingle with the sweet malt and further suggest a Pinot Gris or sweeter white wine to the nose. Soft caramel bread and tart green apples hide in the edges of the scent, but definitely add further definition. I enjoy the smell of this beer more and more as it opens up, but I can’t help but think of it more as a sweet white wine. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and vinous with a solid bitter middle and finish. Tart, malic acid seems to be light but present in the beer and a soft spice mingles with the bitters nicely. The beer is very much a testament to balances, though it gives a nice vinous sweetness as the strongest character. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet white wine, almost in the pinot gris range, with soft notes of green apple and cider. It then suddenly opens into beer with a wash of bready malts and a nice herbal bitterness that balances out the vinous sweet of the beer and carries it into an earthy finish with a touch of generic holiday spices and apple juice. The finish is middling in length, with sweet crackery malt, dry cider, and good-old English hops. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a middling to strong carbonation, a light astringency from the hops, and a thinner, highly drinkable mouthfeel with just enough weight to remind us its beer. The mouth is left dry save for thick saliva in the cheeks and a bitter tingle along the middle of the tongue. Overall, this beer is good. It is far different from other Winter Warmers and Christmas beers that I have had, and initially it disappointed me. Once I got past the fact of its subtlety, however, I was able to appreciate the beer as yet another balanced and superb creation from Sam Smith. This beer nicely showcases what can be done with malts, hops, and a little touch of spices. I’m not wild about sweet white wines, but I found the character interesting. This is a light and highly chuggable winter warmer that is defined by its subtlety and balance. A great execution of the individual parts of brewing.","Maxwell","Jan 08, 2014"

I don't taste much spice either, which is okay amidst all the pumpkin ales around right now. medium body, enough gravity, and some bitter to counter the sweet in the conclusion. a solid beer overall, but not one I will probably go back to honestly.","StonedTrippin","Oct 28, 2013"

Taste is loaded with caramel and toffee, fresh not roasted. Hints of vanilla hit about mid mouth, with some butterscotch and black pepper sneaking in for the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a huge dose carbonation. Perhaps too much carbonation. Could use a bigger dose of alcohol to add a bit of depth. Overall, it's a decent little trip into the winter ales, but there are a lot more bigger bolder beers In this style for this to have lasting appeal.","screamking","Oct 27, 2013"

The taste holds notes of funky wheat, dried honey, light biscuit, light grass, and a slightly heavier touch of earthy greens than before. Things don't meld all that well, though. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish.

Smell is of nutmeg and spices with a hint of cloves and possible corriander. Very pleasant and inviting. Taste follows the nose with a nice blend of seasonal spices, malts and a touch of hops. I like the subtle blend of spice with the rich malts. Not overpowering on the spices as some warmers can be. Feel is medium carbonation with a dryish finish.

However, they did "ale" as well as can be asked- instead of looking for odd ingredients or a new twist, Samuel Smith's went and made an ale that is very good. The smell is malty- not unusual, except that it is good malts, and with nothing strange added. The taste is also malty, a slightly bitter ale with a hint of caramel and yeastiness- again, nothing unusual, except that they pulled it together quite well. Overall, this is more a very good execution of a standard, traditional brew rather than something new and unique. I'm quite happy!","TWM","Dec 30, 2012"

Definitely don't see how this could be a seasonal release for the cold weather except for the alcohol warming properties, but it's a very balanced, simple yet effective beer overall. I agree with others that releases of theirs such as their imperial stout would be more suitable for the cold weather, though.

Not the pleasant hoppy bitterness of a well- crafted ale, this is unpleasant and somewhat medicinal taste reminiscent of Silly Putty. Mouthfeel is thin and watery and the carbonation doesn't last-the beer goes flat rather quickly. I am disappointed in this one, as I'd heard good things about it. Really don't care for this.

Burnt toast ends on the back end of the tongue with english earthy hops that create a super dry yet balanced finish; balance between the semi-sweet fruityness an earthy bitternes, balance between the rich butteriness and dryness. Touch of alcohol heat warms the belly.

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, this is a very pleasing brew, and another welcome addition to the range of holiday beers that haven't been spiced beyond recognition. Indeed, this is fairly simple fare--hops and malts--in relatively normal quantities and strengths. The sugars and fruit esters are cranked up a notch or two for the holidays, somewhat setting this beer apart, but mainly this is just good, solid beer. It doesn't quite qualify as world-class, but it's certainly at the upper end of "good," and worth trying.","jondeelee","Jan 24, 2012"

While the scent is on the weaker side, the taste is a lot stronger than you would expect from the smell. The taste of different malts hit you taste buds hard while you get some taste of sweetness from the caramel malts and sugar. The spices help to finish off this beer with a mellow, drier finish. Smooth, mellow, and rather well made!","Lemke10","Jan 23, 2012"

I appreciate that immensely - as a general rule I don't mind a little spice in my beer but I tend to believe a little goes a long way as far as these ingredients are concerned. This beer seems to come from that same school of thought, and so it should not be surprising that I find this to be the perfect light sipper for an evening by the fireplace. There is little doubt I will be picking this up again before the season is over.

Nose has almost nothing, light malts, some bread and a hint of butter. Almost like a maltier English Pale Ale of sorts, doesn't suggest anything to with a "winter warmer." Taste redeems slightly, slightly sugary bread notes, a bit of caramel malt as well. Maybe a sliver of of spicing, but it's almost indiscernible. A bit of heat on the back end, and a touch of metal as well. Medium body and a carbonation that is adequate, but has a bit of a bite at times. Not sure what the deal with this one is, but I'm unimpressed with this as a winter warmer. Maybe bottling date plays into this somehow?","liamt07","Nov 06, 2011"

I don't get the connection to Winter. There is nothing wrong with this beer it just doesn't give me a reason to love it.

Taste follows suit with a good balance of hops to sit on the sweet caramel and malt bread that is at the core of this one. A gentle fruit component pulls it all together. Feel is medium thickish with a perfect carbonation that is so right in the northern climes at winter. A dry quenching quality to the finish that leaves breadcrust and cereal lingering along with a leafy hops and mineral twang. One glass goes down easy and another would be nice.

Doesn't pour with the quality of head normally found with Sam Smith's beers, but its luminous tawny hue will kick start the warming. Richly malty and cordially fruity aroma - vaguely vinous qualities. Allowing it to settle, a smack of smooth, full malt greets, followed immediately by a quiet storm surge of phantasmal noble hops, and a round cherry fruitiness before dropping off fairly dry, though residual sweetness lingers on the sides of the tongue. At its prime temperature, the malt profile is unmistakably barleywine, and it's quite interesting to get these flavors in a mellow presentation.

Once I tasted though, all of those worries fell away. The flavor was very complex, and changed completely throughout the course of the glass. There was a very nice slightly sweet start with the light caramel forward, and a barely noticeable hop bite at the finish.

Full-bodied, thicker here in terms of sheer mouth weight and slower paced, leads with a peppery kick, teases out more ginger and cumin spice accents. There's a leanness to the flavors if at the same time a persistence start to finish. The rumcake, honey, ginger and orange peels duplicate the nose, lower level of fig, date, peach fruit and lacking in sweetness. Conversely, there's moments of sweet vinegar to it.

Smells of hazelnut, raisin, brown sugar, and cinnamon tickle the nose. Interestingly, this comes off as a brown ale, but not as rich as Sam Smith's own nut brown. Primary tasting notes consist of burnt caramel nuts and hazelnuts. Spicy finish almost confuses itself with a solvent alcohol bite. Winelike grape and plum notes.

The smell is good, caramelized malts dominate the smell, the slightest bit of dehydrated fruit with hints of toffee. The taste is a step up in my opinion. Same concept as the taste but here's where you can taste some winter spices, maybe a bit of nutmeg and also a buttery taste as well, but both of these flavors are pretty subtle. The mouthfeel is pretty good, very smooth, kind of a creamy feel and it's very drinkable.

It's alright and isn't a bad beer by any means, but there's a hell of a lot better winter seasonal releases out there. It's not worth spending too much time with this.

The flavors were sweeter than the aroma suggested, caramel malt coming up front along with the biscuity malt, a slight alcohol heat before it became bitter and herbal for the hoppy finish.

This beer is good, but not brilliant. The ABV is well hidden and overall not a strong winter warmer, but neither is it nourishing or warming.

Once I got the correct beer, I found it to be a pleasing amber color, although I tend to like my beers darker. The aroma was pleasing and not over powering. The taste was subtle, but not too subtle. Spice-like but not too much so. The mouthfeel was thin but appropriate. Overall, a very pleasing beer. I had it with a spicy pasta dish which may have been too strong for it. I would recommend it with food that is more subtle.","captenaj","Dec 12, 2008"

Taste is very balanced, very mild but with lots of detail. It has nice malt, muted grains, floral hops, and a whole lotta 'I like it'. Mouthfeel? It tastes like a silk couch in my mouth. Very, very drinkable. The balance makes it one that I could drink until I ho ho ho.","roblowther","Dec 11, 2008"

I was hoping for a bit better of a flavor experience, as I really didn't think it'd move to porter-like characteristics - and was hoping it was more like the nose, a caramelly Belgian strong. Regardless, worth a try, and one I wouldn't hesitate to pick up if it's in front of me. Like all Sam Smith's this thing packs such a ton of flavor into a low ABV - which just can't be ignored. Such a great brewery.","bigkahunas4","Dec 10, 2008"

Loads of caramel, toffee, dried fruits, nuts, and earthy hops with wisps of roasted and toasted malts. in the background. Flavors are similar to the aroma. There's more of a fruity ester thing going on rather than the dried fruit thing. The dried fruits are still there, though, along with a good deal of caramel. The toasty malts come out more as it warms. Sweet in the middle with a bit of a drying finish with some earthy hop. Mouthfeel is a little thin for what I'd expect from this.

Snappy carbonation in the mouthfeel with a medium to light-bodied presence. Decent drinkability on the whole, but nothing spectacular. I certainly don't regret drinking this -- it was better than I expected based on other reviews. But it's not a seasonal that I will be waiting on pins and needles for either.

The sweetness was a pleasure as this is the first winter warmer that I've had and pretty much one of the first beers that wasn't incredibly bitter, like I like.

Mouthfeel is very smooth with low carbination and a nice sippable factor to it as well and lends itself for great drinkability all year long really.","TheodorHerzl","Dec 11, 2007"

This beverage pours a nice brown-red body with a rich head, with a nice slightly fruity aroma emanating from it.

The taste has the same malt profile, with a little bit of citrusy hop twang. Mouthfeel is a fair medium. I can say this is fairly different than I remember, and I've been buying this every year for some time. While a lot of the malt tastes and smells seem cleaner and clearer, it also seems to be lacking in some of the yeasty/beery elements that I would say made up a good part of the charm that this beer had. Maybe this is due to the brown bottles, maybe a different yeast stain. With the cleaner flavors and larger profile that allows, technically speaking I would say this is a good thing.

It pours a light copper with a finger of tan head that reduces to a collar. The aroma is pleasant, with red apples, cherries, toasted malts, floral hops, and light spice. It tastes of roasted/toasted malts, green/leafy, oily, and floral hops, and a bitterness that begins light, but becomes medium.

The taste is full of that characteristic minerally Sam Smith flavor, but has a nice breadiness, and sweet caramel and toffee notes.

In the past it was hit and miss I guess with the clear bottles and off flavors. This year the brew was very nice, had a copper color to it with a smallish light tan head that had some legs. The aroma was not too shabby; a lot of caramel was present mixed in with a toasted scent. The taste is quite nice, easy drinking as I have really polished it off when I was putting together my hiking equipment. Nice malt flavor at the start that really seems to carry right through, also notes of different spices through out and a slight hop finish. This is a nice brew, one that I use to really look forward to probably 5+ years ago, guess I kind of forgot about it.

There is something oddly appealing about the aroma....skunky Heineken, and caramel sweet malt, overpowering the fusels and butterscotch you will typically smell had there been no skunk. As it warms, vanilla becomes apparent, the hops blossom with a minty character and grainy, toasty malt appears. Swirling stirs up the butterscotch. There is no doubt when you open a Sam Smith ale..you can smell that notorious nose across the room. The mouthfeel is slick yet oily with a medium body and oxidized, soapy finish. The taste is of course very English with plenty of butterscotch (but not overwhelming as the skunk balances it out)...lingering caramel balancing out the medium strong herbaceous and woodsy bitterness. Alcohol is imperceptable. There is a semi-ruddy cardboard finish and aluminum or copper in the aftertaste. This really isn't a great beer in the strict flavor sense (it's quite average by all marks), yet despite it's faults, Sam Smith of any type is intriguing and appealing for it's nostalgia alone which makes it an absolutely divine pleasure. Maybe it's the gold foil, maybe it's that unique bottle (bottled at yorkshire's oldest brewery est1758). It's about as "beer" as beer can get, and lazily transports me to the seat of an English pub in the early 1800's. Recommended.

Taste is the malt from the nose intermingled with hints of wood, mineral water, and a slight butteriness. Slight bitterness on the finish suggests hops, but nothing really comes through in the taste. Medium/thin bodied with fairly low carbonation, this is a pretty easy drinker.

Peppy actually went away pretty quickly and what was left was an unremarkable hint of biscuity grain and a very slight hint of holiday spice. Taste is somewhat complex. The first taste left a heavy impression of the presence of figs or prunes. Subsequent sips left the impression that there are a lot more hops present than what your typical winter beer has.

Taste has that Sam Smith calling card, is it the fermenting squares??? Spices, sweet malts, and bready malts sit atop of that distinct Sam Smith earthiness.

Some toasted malt mixed with nuts and touch of caramel finishes with touch of spice nutmeg and hints of vanilla little hops in finish also but mostly spice.

The taste is fairly dry, with a light-malt tastiness flowing through. Its both nutty and astringent. The beer is somewhat heavily carbonated. Finish is dry and clean, with a moderate bitterness.

Wasn't crazy about the smell at first, but it grew on me as I drank it, I guess it needed to air out, very floral.

Upon opening my senses were assaulted by some of the most potent skunk Ive experienced to date so I poured it and let it air out a bit. I have to say though it really is an attractive brew, crystal clear copper colored body with a light tan head that is thick and resilient, leaving sheets of lace on the glass as it recedes. After it airs out a bit I do detect some sweet malt and leafy, earthy hop underneath the prevailing skunk. As I take a drink I pick up on the creamy, almost buttery malt flavors, the middle presents a nice, robust, flat bitterness, with tiny hints of rum and raison. Nicely bitter through the finish with a smattering of earthy flavor and sweet hints of rum in the aftertaste.

I did drink it out of a chilled beer mug, which is all that was available, and I would recommend letting it warm up a bit to let the flavors come out. A nice bitterness is this beer's best quality.

The aroma was slightly spicy along with perfumey floral scents, and thankfully no skunk. The taste showed typical English beer restraint, and tasted very balanced. There was a buttery, salty, caramelized malt flavor similar to a hard butterscotch candy. The level of hops was high for an offering from across the pond, however the hops were mostly of the aromatic variety with low bitterness. The beer was creamy on the palette with a slightly dry aftertaste. Astonishingly drinkable for a 6% ABV beer, as the alcohol is very well hidden.

It tastes balanced, but somewhat skunked by their trakemark clear bottles - don't get me wrong, I like it, but something is just a little off. Mouthfeel is just about right for me: smooth, but lets you know it has carbonation with tiny bubbles crossing your tongue, if you leave it there long enough. Drinkability is where most Sammy Smith's have their downfall (IMHO); that is why, I believe, they come in 550mL bottles, or 4 packs of 12oz bottles.

What is it that makes English brews so F***ing smooth and drinkable, even after traveling across the pond?

It takes a while to get over this rather unpleasant introduction, but after a while a buttery diacetyl aroma, and a tart, fruity scent begin to take hold. Flavor, too, starts off a bit skunky, and follows much the same progression, with buttery flavors leading off, followed by a caramel-like maltiness, and finally a pleasant floral hop flavor, toffee-like notes, and a slightly sweet, fruity aftertaste. Crisp and smooth, with a medium body. If only Sam Smith's would ditch the clear bottles, this would be a very fine beer.","mzwolinski","Jan 06, 2003"

There is a hint of nutmeg spice in the nose and in the taste profile but oh so subtle.

This is not what one would traditionally consider a winter beer; to me, it is missing the spices that are prevalent with the other winter/holiday beers.

It pours a clear, light orangish-brown/auburn with a full and frothy yellow-tinged head that holds extremely well and leaves excellent lace. The aroma is distinctly buttery (but not quite butterscotch), alongside honey, caramel and toffee. A light fruitiness adds to the toffee but isn't really distinct on its own. Hop aroma is basically absent by design, although there is a mild background grassiness. The body is medium with a lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor starts with a mildly fruity toffee that's coat-tailed by softer caramel notes and then a light butterscotch before a balancing bitterness comes up. It finishes semi-dry with some lingering buttery sweet malt. Some alcohol is noticeable as you come to the end of a pint, but for the most part it's fully cloaked.

4.11,12,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2002 edition. Well, again, what did I smell when I first opened this bottle? Skunk. I've never had a skunky beer from a brown bottle, but I get this with the Samuel Smith's clear bottles all of the time. Fortunately, they're never damaged enough for it to last past the initial bottle opening and pour, a little agitation of the brew brings out the true aroma. Still loses aroma points because of this. Anyway, the brew is clear orange-amber with a big-bubbled, sticky white head that goes down completely after a while. I'm getting hints of spice in the aroma, maybe some orange peel. Sweet malt takes most of the aroma, rich caramel. Kind of buttery too. Hops are there, but the exact aroma is hard to pinpoint. Hitting your palate, it's malty and spicy, as a winter warmer should be. Strong caramel malt and subdued spicy hops, a bit of orange peel spiciness and very slight fruit character, I'd say pear. Malt presence is also grainy under the caramel, which makes it crisp. It gets a bit bready as it warms as well, making this beer almost märzen-like. Smooth in the front, but hops come around more in the back. Not as full-bodied as some other winter brews, but definitely a good brew and very drinkable. This would make a good session brew for wintertime. I think I'm going to start getting my Sam Smith's from a store that keeps them more out of the way of fluorescent light, though.","hyuga","Nov 05, 2002"

The complexity of flavors was minimal, some sweet malt, butterscotch, and some underlying sourness. This beer is surprisingly average. I got annoyed at the tacky mouthfeel it created.

Light in body for a strong ale, but the fairly low carbonation and residual dextrins allow for a pleasant mouthfeel.  Not particularly complex in malt flavor, and compared to other British strongs ales it's a touch bland.  Biscuit malt flavors dominate.  Very grassy and earthy hop flavor... Fuggles all the way.
