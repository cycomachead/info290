3.99,8.7,4.75,3.75,4,4,4,"O: Definitely not my favorite from Sam Smith, but overall a great seasonal beer that is downright sessionable and a must try. I could definitely sit in a pub and throw back a few of these before realizing how much I'd had. Good blend of flavors, and an absolutely exquisite looking beer. It isn't outstanding in anyway outside of the look, but overall it is a very solid addition. Haven't had a bad beer from Samuel Smith's yet. Even with a beer such as this that isn't as enjoyable as others, it's still damn good.","Jaysauras","Feb 19, 2015"

4.31,17.4,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured a clear amber red body with a one finger bubbly white head. A very nice looking ale, a nice gem. Scents of caramel, light molasses, fruity esters, mostly apple, sweet spices, with notes of cinnamon most apparent, rich, sweet bready malt, a very slight alcohol presence, some light aromas of white grape raisins. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, sweet winter ale in the English tradition. Malty, spicy, slightly fruity and quite pleasant. Flavor begins malty and Iightly sweet, with notes of caramel, light levels of sweet spices, balanced by the slight bitterness of earthy and herbal Fuggle and Golding hops. Middle picks up in dryness a bit, with notes of sweet spices, the same hop character, rich caramel malt, apple, rich bready malt. Finish is lightly dry, with the same hop character continuing, alongside light notes of apple and bready malt, with a slight mustiness like a good traditional English old ale. Aftertaste is bready, rich malt and nice English hop bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully balanced ale, striking nicely between Malta and hops, with malt dominating, but hops always present and keeping the beer from being overly sweet. An excellent example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and the slightly chalky feel that many of Samuel Smith's ales have from the Yorkshire water. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice, drinkable winter ale, not too thick nor too thin. Perfectly balanced. Overall this is N excellent winter warmer, easily the best I have sampled. It has a wonderfully malty aroma and an amazingly balanced flavor, aided by a traditionally English mouthfeel. A good example of an English winter ale and well worth drinking.","Auraan","Feb 16, 2015"
