3.82,0.8,4.25,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"It says right on the bottle that it's a red ale, and it sure tastes like other red ales I've had, though perhaps less bitter. I was under the impression that winter warmers were generally more related to brown ales. I didn't really detect any additional spices. Oh well, either way it was delicious. Used a large, short-stemmed Belgian style flute (for lack of a better term). I perceived various shades of amber. A slight, but seductive haziness, although that may have been from how cold it was when served. Aromatically it seemed more akin to some black ales that I've had than to a pale or an IPA. A very sweet, perfumy hoppiness. Sweeter, but with a stronger flavor profile than many a pale, or even some IPAs. Again, reminiscent of certain of the black ale style. Rich, somewhat thick. Head was there to stay.","Libeertarian","Feb 28, 2015"
