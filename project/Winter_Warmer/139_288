Pours deep garnet red with a thin cap of loose foam that fades quickly to a loose rim of bubbles, leaving some lacing on the glass. Smells like...vinegar? Upon a second examination as it warms I can tell that that smell is more butterscotch. Taste is strong sweet malts, surprisingly a bit boozy for the relatively low % (at least compared to other "stronger" beers), and a bit of hop bitterness at the end coupled with leftover spiciness. Not sure if I enjoy this style, but it'd definitely be more enjoyable on a cold winter night (instead of the middle of June).","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 08, 2013"

There is a mild amount of slightly medicinal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Pours a translucent mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head. Head dissipates into a consistent skim across the surface. Some swaths of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is nutty and somewhat consistent with an English Nut Brown; however, there's also a trace of skunk and some caramel and toffee notes. Taste follows nose - skunky quality is a little more forthcoming in the flavor profile. There's also a trace of spice in the mix, perhaps nutmeg, as well as another quality I can't quite tease out - maybe some form of dark fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a consistent carbonation, some creaminess and a slight acidity. The skunk to this beer really kills it for me.

Tastes of sweet caramel 60L and roasted malt, and a slight bit of spice. Not too much hops to speak of here, but most likely willamette. This brew is somewhat a complex drink to ponder on, I feel like it's a tougher one to figure out because not really anything is pronounce or obvious in this brew. Everything melds together really nice here. Overall I used to love this brew alot, but it seems like it has changed since the unavailability down here in Georgia in 09'.

Pours into my trusty testing glass to an orange brown with a beige multi-size bubble head. Taste is well balanced and delicious. Taste starts with a big sweet malt backbone balanced with some zesty more than bitter hops. In the middle the taste is a little more bitter and bitterness builds into the end. The aftertaste is a flat bitterness with a lingering malt base. THe 6.8%ABV is not really noticeable except for the fact that it does indeed deliver on the warmth factor.

Hearty on the palate, but smooth to drink. Would never guess it was 6.8%. Best winter beer of 2009 so far for me.

The retention was not very good but the lacing off the little collar was pretty good as thin rings. The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt, a touch of sourness and some light spice. The flavors were pretty good at first, toasted and sweet caramel malt with some lightly spicy notes that appeared in the middle, after this it became just a little awkward, not bad, just awkward with that touch of sourness and some bitter hops before it became more nutty. The finish was distinctly of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was just a little watery but otherwise solid, the body medium and the carbonation very good.

A nice dark red-brown pour sits with a orangey-beige 2 finger head that laces away like water as you drink. The aroma has a nice spiced leather malt with orange & spice hints. The flavor is milder, a smooth & clean feel in the mouth that starts with a mild hop bitter at the tip of the tongue leading to a nicely malted taste with nods towards cashew & yeast.

There is a slight caramel flavor, slightly roasted malts, maybe even some charred flavors that get accentuated with the bittering hops in the finish. The beer was not terribly complex, nor overly full of character, but the butterscotch flavors typical of Shipyard were definitely present and complemented the somewhat sharp bittering hops.

The diacetyl actually accentuates the fruitiness in this beer; I get notes of fig, some date-like notes and a soft berry note towards the end. This beer is quite malty; lots of toffee, a caramel note and some dry toasted notes. This is definitely a nice winter warmer, it is rich and satisfying with an interesting mix of flavors.

It has a warm and malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, chocolate malts, and roasted barley. The hops help balance the aroma. The taste is excellent. It has a creamy malt flavor that boasts of chocolate and crystal malts. It goes down easy and finishes smooth and slightly warm. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great winter warmer. It is quite complex and full of flavor; a kick ass seasonal.","WesWes","Nov 01, 2004"
3.57,-4.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Casked, it's bit thinner than I remember from the bottles. Enjoyable nonetheless, with a pleasant roasty maltiness and an earthy, natural tone to the overall feel. Not my most favorite winter brew, but it's a treat to have a casked pint.","UnionMade","Feb 03, 2004"
3.21,-14.4,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Served from a 22oz bomber acquired shortly before Christmas. Pours into the glass a very dark amber topped with short lived off white foam. Aroma is mostly malty and sweet with a bit of rotting fruit. Taste is very malty and caramelized, with just a bit of spice and hints of raisin and cherry. Finally some hop bite comes in to save the day towards the end and finishes with a nice bitterness. moderate carbonation, quite full body. Maybe a prelude, but not the main course for me.","mikeys01","Jan 12, 2004"

3.88,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"opened the bomber while dressing for a christmas party. Poured a nice brown/amber with a decent , rocky head. The head stayed fro the whole time with attractive lacing during consumption. the nose was nothing to speak of, mild nutty and spice notes with a hint of sweet roasted malts. The mouthfeel was ale-like, nothing too high ABV or overly spiced. The beer finished well after swallowing with a nice dry hop aroma / mouthfeel and good spicey and nutty flavors that lingered after each mouthful. Overall this was a decent holiday ale that neither dissapointed, nor exhilerated.","counselor","Dec 21, 2003"
3.81,1.6,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Pours a deep dark brown with a tan head. Tastes sweet from the malt, but not too sweet. A touch of buttery and chewey help out the sweetness. Hops are sharp and to the point of balance. The strength is almost fully hidden. The best Shipyard beer I've had so far.","scottum","Dec 18, 2003"

3.03,-19.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"The taste is somewhat unremarkable. A little bit of caramel malt with some of that ever-repetitive Shipyard diacetyl. Not a unique brew by any stretch. The malts give way to a weak hop finish. I’m just a little bit disappointed that this tastes like a lot of other Shipyard beers.","yankeeheel","Nov 30, 2003"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice mahogany color...head that dissipated quickly. Definite winter warmer. Malty aroma with a definite hop accent. Initial malt sweetness ended in a beautiful hop presence at the end. Mouthfeel was light for the high abv. Drinkable, but don't guzzle!","edchicma","Nov 30, 2003"

4.11,9.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Presented in a 22oz. bomber. Poured a deep, glowing ruby color with a medium off white head with medium retention. Aroma is of sweet sticky candy, not very strong but I assume it will grow while it warms. Despite the sweet smell the flavor was surprisingly not oversweet at all. Very nicely balanced, with barley malts on the forefront, finishing with a piney hop bite, and a little extra spiciness throughout. Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation and is medium-heavy in body. Excellent ale for the winter, very warming and definetely very drinkable!","nixhecks","Oct 28, 2003"

A dark amber brew with a very bubbly head, and lots of red highlights make for a delicious look. The aroma is a bit mellow, some caramel malt and a little roast and spicy hops in the backround. This is a full bodied beer with a nice roasty/nutty finish. It has a nice malt sweetness with some spicy hop flavor that builds as it comes to room temp. At the half way point it has a nice mellow bitter finish to balance the sweetness. An easy drinking big beer that fits the local weather scene.","jeffboo","Apr 01, 2003"
4.1,9.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This ale poured a slightly hazy, dark, copper-red color with good, slightly off-white foam that did not leave much lace. The smell was modest but good: sweet caramel malt aroma. The taste was sweet: some caramel malt overtones on top of a candy sugar taste. There were also hints of oak and floral hops, and the sweetness lingered on the tongue. The mouthfeel was smooth and relatively clean (other than the sweetness). The body was medium. This was a very drinkable and enjoyable ale.","UncleJimbo","Mar 09, 2003"
4.13,10.1,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4," Served warmer this brew seems to come alive. A bolder malt profile and the spicy hoppiness lead into the warming alcohol feel very nicely.

3.9,4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Reddish-brown in color with a small off-white head that didn't last long. The smell is a nice balance of hops and malt. The taste is similar in terms of balance but a bit more complex. The hops take over a bit in the end for a nice bite. It reminds me a lot of Youngs Old Nick Barley Wine Style Ale but better. This beer would do well with a bit more ageing.","CharlesRiver","Dec 16, 2002"
3.31,-11.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Dry grainy head, made fizzy noises but lasted. The body is the color of cherry stain or medium-dark sweet tea. Toasty malt aroma some unidentifiable funkiness. The flavor incorporates the caramel and toasty malt flavors with this unusual flavor that reminds me of Sweetwater Festive Ale. I had attributed the flavor to mace, which is one of the spices in Festive Ale, but I'm not so sure this one is spiced. Maybe it's the butterscotch flavor of the infamous Ringwood yeast, but I didn't know Sweetwater used that yeast for Festive Ale so I'm confused. There's a bit of slighty citric hops underneath all this that breaks up the malt-funk party a bit.","aracauna","Nov 23, 2002"
4.8,28,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"A deep mahogany body with soft ruby highlights is capped by a firm light tan head that holds quite well and leaves some nice lace. When served only lightly chilled, it will maintain a solid head as it warms. The aroma is of a sweet caramel & light chocolate malt, some mild spice, and butterscotch-like diacetyl that actually adds greatly to the character! Reminiscent of a rich holiday cake! Very nice. The body is full with a very fine and restrained carbonation that leaves it exceptionally creamy and smooth - almost syrupy as the carbonation breakout foams up under the warmth of the mouth. The flavor is rich with some limited ripe fruit upfront, coat-tailed by a biscuity maltiness that's slathered at first in caramel - and later in soft milk chocolate, a mild spiciness as it crosses that palate and then a firm butterscotch, some mineral-like & leafy hoppiness and an underlying bitterness in the finish. Long, lingering and almost as rich as the flavor itself - the aftertaste is massively impressive with swirling notes of caramel, butterscotch, drying bitterness and leafy hoppiness! Do yourself a favor and enjoy this at cellar temperature as a dessert beer. Fantastic! Absolutely worth seeking out as a special treat to be enjoyed with a good book in front of the hearth.","NeroFiddled","Nov 19, 2002"
