4.36,16.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours a medium amber with a little cloudiness and formed a two finger head. Feels nice with a little alcohol bite. Finishes smooth, a lot smoother than the front end would suggest. You first taste dark malt with a sweet finish of brown sugar. For a minute I thought it was a Brown Ale. Overall I'm very pleased with shipyards take on this. Very good beer for a style that's sometimes overlooked. Great beer. Well done shipyard!","shabbtastic","Jan 03, 2015"

I will have to revisit again, next year, to hopefully revise.","lambpasty","Dec 28, 2014"
