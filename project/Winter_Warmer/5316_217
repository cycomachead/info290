4.5,17.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a three finger tan leather head with fine retention and lacing. Dark red and brown, but not cloudy. Aromas of raisins and espresso with some fig as well. Noting some cloves and the smallest hint of mint. Tastes like aroma, with addition of milk chocolate and black cherry. Feel is balanced, smooth, and moderate carbonation lingering toward front of tongue. Higher alcohol does not overwhelm my tongue in this beer. This is a great winter brew, and widely available for about a dollar each. I love the complexity, balance, strength and price all rolled into one.","sporklift87","Jan 31, 2015"

4.5,17.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance is a deep mahogany with garnet Ruby red clarity at the edges. A beige head settles and leaves great lacing. The first smell is of cherry sweetness and some smokey roast, with vanilla, caramel and oak.  Delicious flavor with tons of complexity. Smoked wood, lingering oak, slight hop bitterness imparts some musty earth flavor. A bit of cherry, oak, caramel, toffee, and slight vanilla character. Medium bodied, medium low carbonation. The alcohol is slightly hidden but nice and warming. Overall this is one of the best winter warmers out there and the price point makes it affordable enough to knock back more than one without feeling guilty. Extremely complex and layered flavors. Highly recommended.","crob3888","Dec 18, 2014"
