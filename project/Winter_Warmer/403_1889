3.68,4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/25/2014. Pours fairly clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, herbal, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. A light metallic note is present in the aromas as well. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, herbal, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, light pepper/pine, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Some light metallic/astringency in the taste, but not overpowering. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English strong ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. I felt this could have been better if it were less hoppy, but was a nicely enjoyable offering otherwise.","superspak","Jan 26, 2015"
