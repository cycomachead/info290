3.84,2.7,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"O:  if Rahr labelled this a "porter," I wouldn't know enough to say different; very thin mouthfeel, standard taste and smell notes of roasted/charred malt, subdued sweetness, subdued hop profile, none of the spices you run into in many American-made winter warmers ... the 8.5% ABV is the only tip here that this isn't a simple porter; frankly, I love it because it's one of the easiest drinking higher ABV beers I've run across.  fans of the big spicy, robust winter warmer might frown on this lighter take on the style.","Premo88","Nov 29, 2014"

4.8,28.3,,,,,,"12 oz bottle was bottled October 11, 2014.  This beer is very well balanced, but in my opinion must be enjoyed at 60-65 degrees.  Pours a beautiful beige thick 2 finger head that stays for a while and dissipates into a thin film .  Dark black cherry color that shows some light through, but appears to have no sediment.  Smells of roasted chocolate and German style malts.  Taste at slightly over 60 degrees:  Chocolate, dark ripe fruit, very subtle English hop twang. Tastes thin and watery at fridge temp, but full flavored, rich, and creamy at (Texas) room temperature (60-65) - 8.5% ABV is barely noticeable.  Just enough carbonation.  Overall delicious English style dark winter warmer from Rahr & Sons Brewery.","nizzle8287","Nov 27, 2014"
