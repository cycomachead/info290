3.61,2.6,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"I will be the first to admit that carbonation seems to be among the first things to go. I had a good finger of deep-tan head until it gently fell, leaving behind a thin layer of head. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights and I could not decide if that was the result of my having stirred up some sediment that its clarity was not better. Nose was very caramel-malty, but not much beyond that. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a sweet-sour flavor on the tongue. I may have caught this one just in time! It was still caramel-malty sweet, but a sharp sourness was beginning to creep in. Finish was lingering with the caramel sweetness, so perhaps I did not screw it up as badly as I thought ...

3.53,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had a dusty, vintage bottle at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Aside from the dust and old green label, this is clearly a cellared, but well-aged beer. There's no strong newspaper or cardboard oxidation (thank god), but still a spicy, leathery character with hints of sherry. There were also pleasant notes of lemon and berry fruit. It was a complex beer, but the aged character was a bit heavy. Still, a very nice experience and tasty beer.","tempest","Jan 13, 2011"

There is a slight woodiness to the aroma and a characteristically British metallic minerality on the finish. Taste is a little muddled up front, with a lot more earthiness and with a mineral finish. The breadiness goes away. Refreshing and a good hit of dry malt that lends some more chocolate. Not sweet, and easy to drink.

The aroma is very light toasted malts and nutty notes. The flavor is very nice; smooth bursts of fruit, toasted malts, light nutty flavors and a rich and full mouthfeel. Very nice. I love the label and the beer. Easygoing and yet very flavorful. Great. Also, this beer is a few years old, best by September 2007, but still quite good.

3.58,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is the second time that I have drank this beer, and surprised that it did not get reviewed the first time. The beer opens with a solid brown color and a billowing tan head that rose powerfully to the top of the imperial English pint glass. The beer later proved to show great head retention and lacing, despite it's deep cola-like hue. Aromas a sweet malts take on molassas and toffee-like proportions and transfer directly to the flavors. Undertones of chesnuts, cashews, and berry character shows more so in the flavors that the scent. Quite estery, spicy, and with a hint of alcohol warmth on the palate. The feel is moderate, but a bit disjointed with the taste. I can't decide if I want the body to be heavier to support the sweetness or if it should be softer, allowing easier drinkability. Finishes a bit too sweet for the pungent / perfumy hops to counter. Lingers with a cola-like flavor that serves as a bit of a distraction. The problems that I have with this beer is common with those that I have in most winter warmers. The style is obviously not my favorite. Mainly because it tries too hard to be everything to everyone, and doesn't pull any of them off well. Still, it's difficult to criticize a well-made beer.","BEERchitect","Jan 25, 2008"

A good bit of fruity flavors, mostly banana, and a very light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was very light on the palate making this beer quite drinkable and sessionable. I used to love this beer years ago, but now it seems boring. It's way too light to be a true Winter Warmer.

The smell was pretty good, with a nice cocoa / stout aroma which was decent without being too powerful... The taste was great - a smooth cocoa / latte finish which could have used a few more spices, but was overall a nice mix without being over-bearing... At 5% abv, I thought it could use a little more alcohol to be more appropriate as a warmer, but this was still an enjoyable brew with a good mouthfeel and a great drinkability, partly due to the fact that the aroma and taste were not over-bearing... all said, a really good brew that is definitely recommended...","dsa7783","Dec 09, 2007"

As I said this was the first Winter Warmer I had on cask and of course with the new merger, it was brewed in the Wells Brewery which Young's now shares. Wonder how much better the Ram version was?

The taste is a blend of these flavors with a subdued sweetness that grows as the beer warms.

Not much of an aroma, but what there is tends to be primarily of light caramel malts. Medium mouth feel that sometimes feels a bit on the light side. Light, sweet caramel malt start that is also bready in nature and a well-balanced and pronounced hop finished. Hops last long into the aftertaste. Not an overly complex or impressive yet is quite drinkable and well balanced. Not my favorite, but would probably make a good session brew.","byrd","Jan 16, 2004"

Taste: Creamy chocolate like mix of malts dark roasts give it a nice full richness the fruit flavors that come through add to the festive attitude of the beer and the creamy finish is full of caramel malts blended with a piney hop finish. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale very full of flavor with a mild carbonation nothing is too much here. Drinkability: Excellent appetising ale from Young's rich flavors and perfect blend of the malts and hops adds to the pure ease of drinkability here.","WVbeergeek","Jan 16, 2004"

Aroma was a bit fruity, with some overripe apple. Apple notes continued in the flavor, with toffee malt abounding. A very soothing, friendly beer, more appropriate for fall than winter. I would probably put this more in the ESB spectrum.","Brent","Jan 12, 2004"

I must say the smell did not excite me too much but the taste more than made up for it. As soon as it hit my mouth there was a very slight grainyness to it but that was soon overshadowed by a great semi sweet carmel like flavor.

Caramel malt and roasted grain dominate the flavor profile, with fig and darker prune like fruitiness adding depth. Lightly hopped, and although dry and well attenuated, significant residual sweetness remains unhindered. Lightly bodied, but dextrinous enough in mouthfeel to help maintain its excellent drinkability. Subdued earthy hop flavor. Finishes clean and lightly roasty.

Now that I'm familiar with it I appreciate it more, but still tend to pass it by in lieu of more full bodied beers. That said... It pours a slightly hazy chestnut body that's capped by a decent sized, creamy, tan head that holds OK - but drops to a thin collar and whispy surface foam. The nose offers the standard fruity Young's character with notes of berries, raisins and plum above a mild caramel maltiness. The hops are restrained to the background in the aroma, but move forward in a flavor that's fruity and lightly caramelish - quite toffee-like - with a firm earthy & grassy hoppiness. It finishes dry with some softly lingering fruit and malt. Neither rich nor complex, but still an enjoyable pint at the local. As with almost all of the Young's products, it should really be served at close to cellar temperature to best perceive its maltiness and the interation of the yeast's fruitiness.","NeroFiddled","Nov 20, 2002"

The taste starts of with bubblegum like notes, followed by a light malty sweetness.  Hops are noticeable throughout, but fairly rough.  Medium-bodied, with what I can only describe as a somewhat watery aftertaste.  I understand the disappointment many feel with this beer, labeled as it is as a "winter warmer."  That label evokes thoughts of a beer suitable for quiet sipping with book in hand and fireplace by one's side.  This is certainly not that sort of beer.
