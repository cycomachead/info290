4,2,,,,,,"Pours a dark brown color with a white head.  The aroma has a lot of malts, unfermented sugars, fruit and alcohol.   The taste starts off with a bit of dark fruits, turning nutty, wheaty and a bit strong.  The beer is damn smooth, more than likely from the oat additions in brewing.  Brewed with rye, sage, caraway, juniper and chestnuts, they meld together to form a unique flavor but everything is so balanced it is almost non-distinct.  The beer is full bodied but very smooth on the palate.  Soft, prickly carbonation makes for a smooth drink (the beer poured from the tap just a bit heady).  Overall, this would certainly be considered a success, and apparently this was a collaboration between Nøgne Ø, Stone and Jolly Pumpkin.  Its not a sour, thats for sure, sorry Jolly Pumpkin fans.  It is, however, a very good beer!","Stinkypuss","Oct 29, 2014"
