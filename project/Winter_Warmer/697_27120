3.5,-13.4,,,,,,"I'm generally fond of Winter Warmers and similar spiced up holiday beers, so I was surprised that I didn't take to this one all that much.   It seemed a bit of a muddle, with various flavors there, but not really working well together.   A bit too sweet.  It's still a decent beer, don't get me wrong, but just not to my taste.   This was the 2014 edition, poured into a tulip.   Foamy!","VashonGuy","Jun 19, 2014"
