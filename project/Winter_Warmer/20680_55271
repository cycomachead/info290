4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Blanche de Namur small pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transmission and a half finger dark khaki head with good retention and lacing.Aroma of sweet bready malt with hints of caramel, dark dried fruit, mainly raisins and dates, light hay; earthy winter spices. Flavor is caramel malt with some toastiness, dark dried fruit, cinnamon and clove, cocoa, light molasses. Finishes with earthy spices and light hop bitterness. Medium bodied with light creaminess. This is exactly what I hope for in a winter warmer; seasonal spicing in a rich malty body. The malt depth and woody, earthy components make it clear why this makes such a good base for the BA version. Very nice seasonal.","LiquidAmber","Nov 30, 2014"
3.5,-8.9,,,,,,"Gotta say- if you're expecting  a traditional "winter warmer" style beer before taking your first sip of this beer, you are in for a bit of a surprise. If this was sold year round as a porter I wouldn't be surprised at all. Deep dark appearance, tan head. Very malty but not in the same way a lot of winter ales are;Very roasted chocolate and nut taste, still has that hint of boozy aroma though. Has a roasted nutty finish, dark chocolate linger. This is a great beer, but a bit of a different direction than your typical winter warmer.","RenzoD","Nov 19, 2014"
