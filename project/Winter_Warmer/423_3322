3.72,0,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Overall, this was a nicely spiced winter warmer.  The flavoring is savory enough to keep you coming back for more, and the spice is certainly there, but the wonderfully decreased pint night special pricing also helped quite a bit.  The beer went well with our jalapeño burger and chicken Caesar wrap, respectively, helping to quell any spice or savoriness from the meal.  Really, rather standard, but flavorful, aromatic, and hearty enough for season.","TheBrewo","Jan 04, 2015"

3.78,1.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"O - It is not a bad beer. It is a nice change of pace from a little of the heavily spiced winter warmers. It is nothing to trade a kidney for, but I would be happy to have it each winter.","buschbeer","Dec 30, 2014"
3.76,1.1,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Amber to brown in color with a lot of suspended minuscule sediment within the body gives it a murky complexion.  A half inch of tightly knit beige head is present.  I smell light malt and perhaps hazlenut.  The flavor is more of a nutty fare with gentle citrus dry hopping.  The body is fairly smooth and dry.","Franziskaner","Dec 28, 2014"
