Again I dont get any hops or boozy bite. I do also get a little dark fruit, some red grape. This beer is pretty one dimensional but enjoyable for what it is. The beer does go down very easy and I find it a nice treat for the evening. Nothing outstanding but a nice malty treat.","sulldaddy","Mar 19, 2014"

They tweak the recipe each year just a bit to keep things interesting. Great head with a nice dark copper/amber color below.

You don’t get the nutmeg/cinnamon and other spices like you commonly taste in the typical winter seasonal. This is a more straight- forward beer without the holiday additives. I like it more and more with each passing sip and I think it is safe to say that most guests at your next holiday party will feel the same.

Here, they seemed less focused on the malt profile, allowing for a generous aromatic hop bite to permeated the sip. The aroma showed more of this as well, with bright green freshness of hops, and paler grain. This paleness does give a cheapness to the end of the swallow, and while this one isn’t as “warming” as others for the style, it will certainly keep you away on a cold winter’s afternoon.","TheBrewo","Jan 09, 2013"

Texture is very soft. Low carbonation. This is an easy beer to drink and makes a nice nightcap. I truly enjoy this beer. It is a little on the light side for a winter warmer.

The nose comprises mixed greens, very light menthol, and sweet, nutty toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some mild pine needles and something that sort of approaches a shadow of ginger. Gotta say, this sits very poorly on my tongue. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a muddled, unpleasant winter warmer. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2012"

The color was clear copper with a big khaki head that retained decently and left sliding spots of lacing. The aroma was not as spicy as it had been in the past, showcasing caramel malt and piney hops instead with only hints of clove. The flavors were a bit heavy on the herbal/piney hops at first with a caramel malt backbone and hints of toasted nuts and toffee behind that. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation mid-level. Not as spiced as many winter warmers which I found welcome though nothing amazing as a stand-alone brew either.","thekevlarkid","Jan 08, 2012"

I didn't taste much more than what I could just smell. The mouthfeel is nothing short of lame. No chewiness to it at all.

The aroma had a nice malt smell to it, which really seemed to have a toasted property. I would also say that caramel shines through with a nice slight spice to it. The taste, while not being stupendous has a very good quality to it, it is very easy drinking as the malt properties lead to a nice flavor. Caramel comes to mind quickly with a slight nut flavor. Seems to be a bit dry. I will say that I am surprised that this is considered a winter warmer, to me it seems like a simple pale ale that is well balanced. This would be a fine session brew although at 6.1% could get you in trouble, but to me that is the feel of this one.

I was pretty satisfied though, having copped a single 12oz bottle from Wine and More in West Orange for about $1.79... at 6%, there was a nice alcohol glow pervading from the drink, and the sweetness lingered on the mouth for a bit... great drinkability and the alcohol is hardly noticeable behind a sweet finish...

Thle palate was somewhat spicy, and the finish a mix between dry-bitter, and stale. It was alomost like Redhook mixed two different styles. This was a very strange beer, although not too bad overall.

Slightly vigorous pour leaves a thin finger of fizzy off-white head that quickly fades away to a light ring of white lacing. Aroma is hoppy and of sweet caramel malts, very light on the nose, slightly grainy as well. Taste starts out hoppy and slightly bitter, similar to an IPA, then transforms into a sweet and malty finish with a light bittering dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation levels, goes down smooth. Easy to drink, decent brew although a far cry from the style's normal characteristics. The hoppiness is far from overbearing or anything, the bottle reads "assertively hopped", and it is, although this brew doesn't taste much like a winter warmer. Not enough carmel sweetness and maltiness to warm with. All around a solid beer with an overall bland character but worth a shot, but not if you're in the mood for a winter warmer.","danielocean03","Oct 31, 2006"

The nose is not strong, but shows some dark malt and holdiay spice aromas. An odd, but not foul smell hides behind the malt, could be from wood chips or stale hops used in dry hopping...I don't know. Toasted barley and cinnamon flavor, followed by a well balanced dose of english hop bitterness. Aftertaste is hebal and tea-like, but fades gracefully.

This year (2004) is very similar to SN Celebration. They went a little more hoppy this year and steered away from the heavy malt and spices. It is a red copper color wiht a very nice head and lacing. The aroma had a small amount of vanilla and nutmeg, but was mostly full of hops. There was a nice fresh hopness to this beer and it was very satisfying.

The color is nice, caramel reddish brown like a coke, and crystal clear, but the head disspates very rapidly. The aroma is very nice, with a full dose of a spicy, piney hop and a slight maltiness. The flavor is good but a bit thin - nice hop notes and a touch of malt in the middle, but the maltiness lacks depth and overtones (I hate to say it that way but that's the best I can do - it doesn't generate much feel for caramel, toffee, toastiness, etc. it just kind of sits there).

Dark copper to brown hue with a dulling sheen to the whole affair. Copious malt front to nose with some spices kicking about  cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg, spruce essence perhaps. To taste, welcoming deep malt with a robust, almost scotch ale like overall profile; a touch of chestnuts roasted on an open fire toastiness too. On the whole, a pretty good offering from Redhook when I am used to uninspiring stuff from them, for the most part.","Truh","Nov 24, 2004"

The nose was of moderately roasted malts accented with a subtle citrusy hop bouquet. The taste was fairly light in the roasty malt department for the style. There were some tasty flavors however, in the form of grapefruit and lemony citrus accents, and an aggressively hopped finish. I did pick up some alcohol in the aftertaste, which tainted any potential lingering pleasantries. I still would have liked more of that sharp or roasty maltiness up front.

Unfortunately the head developed poorly, there was little more than dishwater bubbles that covered half of the bare beer. A very small amount of disorganized specks of lace dotted the glass as I drank it. Immediately the nose tells me two things, this is hoppy and this is not the Winterhook of last year(s). Im rather pleased with the pine aromas, undercurrents of floral, and distant hints of maltiness at the back. The bouquet has a couple layers of depth and a distinct invitation to quaff. The palate is bitter upfront, from the piney hops, a smidge of floral follows. The maltiness is a little lacking and ordinary, traces of caramel but not a lot of sweetness. A little ale fruitiness is interwoven. The finish is mildly hoppy with a pleasant piney aftertaste, some direct bitterness. Unexpectedly more-ish and surprisingly tasty especially considering Redhook does not wow me. I even got hop burps! Medium in body, a touch thin, more malt would help. The carbonation is a little low but tolerable, very drinkable and pleasant to quaff as well. The abv is low enough to have a few at a time. If Redhook sticks with this recipe then the new and improved Winterhook will be a staple in my refrigerator when winter rolls around.

This one is certainly good and the best Redhook I've had, bar the late lamented Rye beer - not to be confused with that yellow, swillish Sunrye. Dark ruby with medium head and adequate lacing. Malts are sweet and fruity, some light elements of berries and lots of caramel. Buttery. Hops are faint and mostly in the piney, spicy aroma. I had a six-pack that was just days off the bottling line and it was remarkable. This is a couple weeks older and not quite as good. A fine winter warmer, maybe could do with a touch more hop bitterness.","Thrasher","Dec 07, 2003"
3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a drinkable winter beer that is very good. I had pretty low expectations going into this tasing and was pleasantly suprised with the result. This would not be my first choice, but it is certainly worth the effort.","filabrazilia","Dec 05, 2003"
3.88,8.1,4,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Mahogany color with a brown receding head. Low aroma of sweet malt belies the full flavor jumping out of this beer. Sweet malt flavor, yes, but surprisingly hoppy. Smooth floral hops, not biting, with definite hints of citrus and pine. The finish is adorned with spicey flavors including cinnamon and brown sugar. Very enjoyable beer.","far333","Dec 03, 2003"
3.6,0.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This has a nice little hop bite to it's initial taste, but then turns to malty. It's color was a dark amber with a tan head. The head was frothy, but then went down to a laceing of the same color. I was most inpressed with the cover up of the higher alcohol in this brew. i would have never guessed that it was almost 7%. It's a little rough around the edges on the first taste, but smooths out as you go.","JISurfer","Dec 02, 2003"
4.08,13.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Excellent looking and an eye pleasing beer with a clear and bright light garnet color with tinges of orange. Small fruitiness in the aroma with more of it coming out as the beer warmed up, along with sweet and grassy hops. Aromas included sweet cherries, apricots and birch. The beer is a dry one, light in malt body with a biting and bitter tang and a dry, fruity finish. Light, tasty and flavorful. The dryness is an asset to this beer. Very good.","pezoids","Dec 01, 2003"
3.65,1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Ruddy chestnut hue with a light mirk. Stiff, pitted, steadfast vanilla white head leaves lace. Juicy tangerine laced with mint sprigs upfront in aroma. Burnt, buttery, brown sugar sprinkled biscuit and dark toffee are secondary. Sweet cocoa undertone. Quite appetizing aromawise. Simple medium lovibond caramel initially in flavor, is superceded by assertive, pithy hop bitterness and sharp suggestion of grated cinnamon. Mellows quickly, with stately butterscotch and bittersweet marmalade notes contrasting the barbed hop character. Understated hints of tart plum surface late along with breezy, disparate dry cocoa, lending dessert like qualities. Soft on the palate, and perhaps a touch lean in body to complement the malt backbone. Finishes both buttery and burnt, with lingering diacetyl and singed biscuit tones. A flavorful, albeit raw brew with a surprising amount of character. Quite tasty, and overall a well above average winter seasonal. Has aging potential.","marc77","Nov 29, 2003"
3.83,6.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice deep reddish brown color with a decent creamy off white head that leaves sticky sheets of lace. Fruity and citrusy aroma, smells kind of like an IPA, hoppy citrusy flavors with some caramel. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel, finishes with a sharp bitterness, much better than I remember.","maxpower","Nov 29, 2003"
3.78,5.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a clear deep copper with a khaki colored head. Thick lacing. Aroma consists of fruity hops, grapefruit, malt and a hint of chocolate. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a mildly creamy texture. Malt meets hops in this winter offering. Citrusy grapefruit upfront with some buried caramel flavor. Nuttiness emerges toward the back. Thick piney hoppy finish. It's a decent offering and an enjoyable brew. Not sure I'd necessarily seek it out on a regular basis to purchase, but I'd consider ordering it if it were on tap at the place I was at.","Winter","Nov 28, 2003"

3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It had been years since I had a Winterhook and I don't recall at all what it tasted like and if I liked it or not. I enjoyed this one, though. A very solid beer that I will be picking up again this season.","Quaffer","Nov 20, 2003"
3.7,3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear dark amber color, nice 1/2 inch biege head that laces in vertical drips. Hoppy nose, some bits of juice and fruit. Weaker malt taste profile than I like in a Winter brew, fairly standard brown sugar and cinnamon but not holiday spicy. Hops are assertive, balsamic and slightly dry and helping the finish markedly. Body seems more viscous than previous years, I'd give it full-on medium. Comparing notes, I'd say that hops and mouthfeel are improved but that an interesting sweetness could be bumped up.","ADR","Nov 17, 2003"
3.85,7.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with an off-white head over clear and dark reddish liquid. Piney and herbal, citric notes abound. Taste is lightly sprucy, piney and malty. Dryness pops up right about now. Finishes syrupy yet dry with a nice stickiness to it...an interesting brew.","beerluvr","Nov 15, 2003"
3.53,-1.7,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"Overall Impression 4: Easy drinking winter ale. Good pure flavors, hops and malt doing their thing. Its very clean and neat, but not a lot of punch for the winter season. Still, a very well crafted beer.","HardTarget","Nov 15, 2003"
2.9,-19.2,4,4,2.5,2,2.5,"Appearance: Ruby tinted with a nice sized tan head, leaving lacing around my glass fine but hey it's there. Aromatics: The cascades weigh in nicely here upfront floral and piney not bad not a lot of malt sweetness but definitely not bad the hops are nice. Flavor: Is definitely tame, low pur of caramel malt tones slightly spiced not bad at all, with what I was expecting to be a roaring hop profile was nothing at all just a mild finish of hops, disappointing but I was expecting much. Mouthfeel: Thin not much texture lacks body, smooth carbonation for a winter seasonal this is a light beer. Drinkability: Is mediocre cant' picture myself buying this ever again.","WVbeergeek","Nov 14, 2003"

3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Has a pretty medium copper color after poured into a pint glass. Little head retention, but nice lacing that hangs around. Pleasant nose is a bit complex, but dominated by malt sweetness, hops, and a hint of woodsy spices. Medium bodied in the mouth, definitely crisp with hops. I swear that there are some kind of spices trying to reach out and bite your tongue. Dry aftertaste and definitely a belly warmer. Above average for a seasonal ale.","merlin48","Nov 12, 2003"
3.98,10.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"This ale is a bit beyond medium but not quite full bodied. There is also a certain density to the mouthfeel that is nice. A pretty easy drinker but not what I would call a session beer. It is more of a slow end of the evening ale.","Rumrunner","Nov 07, 2003"
3.41,-5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3," This beer is a deep, deep ruby color, it is very clear and pours with a tan head. At first the aroma is of dark fruit, then the hops kick in a bit. The hops come to dominate the aroma, but they are not super strong either. The first taste is lightly fruity (hints of cherry). The finish is off dry, and is accompanied by a hoppiness that is complimentary to the fruit flavors. No real strong flavors that jump out at me. The hops are the dominant flavor here, but for some reason this beer tastes a tad on the weak side.","Gueuzedude","Nov 06, 2003"

3.65,1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Color is a clearish coppery brown, medium sized head of light tan hue, fades slow to a thin puff and lace sticks in moth holed-sheets. Smell is roasted malts, somewhat hefty and heavy, sweet with solid caramel and toffee thats reminiscent of burnt cookies. Hop notes of deep pine. Mostly coming through as it warms. Taste has a good portion of sweet malts, caramel, lightly burnt, lightly earthy, hops come across late with a fairly nice bite and bitterness that lends some dried pineyness. Some spiced grab shows through in the finish along with a smidgon of alcohol thats a bit warming. Feel is medium bodied and has a light grainy texture with a hop kick in alot of the finish with a spicy note. Not bad for Redhook, I was expecting something lack luster, but the late kick this has kept me intrigued.","tavernjef","Nov 02, 2003"

Nose is malt loaded and sweet, hints of caramel, crisp and fresh, the start is lightly sweet, the top skeletal in feel. Finish is striking in its acidity, the hops indifferent in their spiciness, very dry and lingering aftertaste. Drinkable beer, but is a bit thin-waisted for me to give it much credit.","Gusler","Oct 27, 2003"
