4.03,12.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a deep, dark amber with 1/2 inch foamy head that stays throughout.  A LOT of lacing left along the glass as you finish.  Sweet, malty, robust aroma -- the taste follows suit.  Good amount of carbonation.  For a 6.0% ABV, very easy to drink.  Perfect winter warmer.","oldirtycaffrey","Dec 23, 2014"
