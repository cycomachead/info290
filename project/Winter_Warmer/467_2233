3.28,-11.8,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This is pretty good.  A nice subtle version of the style; sweet, hoppy, toasted flavors are balanced off one another pretty well. The only thing that really surprises me is the slightly thin mouthfeel.","TheSSG","Jan 31, 2015"

3.92,5.4,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall : this is a decent beer, and although I am at a loss for words in describing it, it's something I'd have again. It's very fruity and earthy. A nice Belgian dark ale.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Jan 24, 2015"
3.96,6.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall this is a nice balanced beer that doesn't go overboard in any direction but still lets you know it is well made.  Unlike some spiced winter warmers the spices are an integral part of the flavor rather than something that dominates it.  That said, however, if I were going to stock up on a Winter Warmer I think I'd still give the Lancaster Brewing Winter Warmer the nod in preference to this one, if only because I like the way Lancaster Brewing have used both British and American hops and because of the the greater warmth from the higher ABV.","drtth","Jan 19, 2015"

I got a light spritz as a result and now my curiosity was piqued to CANduct an inverted Glug. The pseudo-cascade came up pretty quickly, requiring that I back off, but not before the formation of three fingers of dense, rocky, light-tan head with good retention.
