3.82,1.3,3.5,3.25,4.25,3.75,3.75,"The lively pour quickly overwhelms my porter glass, leaving a 3-finger head peaking over the top of the rim, with at least 2 oz. remaining in the bottle. In time, the rocky creme-colored head receded, leaving scalloped edges and moderate lacing. There is a nice clarity to the garnet-brown beer, accentuated with ruby highlights. The brew gives off a mild fruity aroma, with tame holiday spice and bready malts. There is the faintest trace of hops, and no alcohol in the nose. In total, the smell of the beer is pleasant, but muted. In contrast, the flavor is complex and bold. Sweet caramel and chocolate malts dance with a rye-like grain and fruity esters. There is a hint of black licorice, sweet vanilla bean, and distinct cinnamon and allspice in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy with a medium-full body. There's a little warming heat on the breath from the spice and ABV, which is just south of 6%. The distinct "Sam Adams" flavor is present in the backbone of this beer, but it has enough character to stand on its own for sure. Winter warmer? This is more like a holiday amber ale. Perhaps my palate has matured, but I seem to recall this beer being bigger in seasons past. I'd really like to see them beef this up with a  higher ABV, creating more warmth. A richer, fuller body and more potency in the aroma would allow it to stack up against some of the other winter craft wonders. Especially if they are going to put only 2 in each seasonal pack. For what it is, it's still a delicious brew, and one I will continue to seek out during Christmas time.","JohnnyI","Dec 28, 2014"

While the nose on it was kind of weak I picked up some delicate spice aromas. The taste was not a mess of overly spiced beer but it was very lightly spiced solid ale with a great malt taste.  While there is nothing that stands out about this beer I think it is a very solid beer that would be a staple in my fridge during the holidays if I did not have to buy a 12 pack of Sam Adams junk to get just TWO bottles.  I think that it ridiculous to put the solid beers in a case and only include two.

4.69,24.4,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"     Overall, I've choosen a 4.75 for Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale - Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams). A more tame choice amongst the other availible winter warmers. I'd liken this to an imperial style of porter, to go out on a "genre limb". This needs to come in six packs or cases where I live, so I can enjoy this more often and not have to purchase the disappointing winter seasonal sampler pack.","Caveworm","Dec 03, 2014"

4.05,7.4,4,4,4,4,4.25,"Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale brewed by Boston Beer Company, with an ABV of 5.90%  This brew pours out a nice brown color with a nice off white head.  Old Fezziwig Ale has the look of cola, not saying that it a bad thing.  The smell is rich sweetness and grains. Now for the taste , it is sweet with some grains, and malts. You also pick up on some spices in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice ,it is also rich,and clean.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it.I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market.  Boston Beer Company did a nice job with this one.  I would buy this brew again. Overall I'm giving Old Fezziwig Ale a 4.25 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Dec 02, 2014"

Aroma of sweet bready and caramel malt, cinnamon, allspice, gingerbread. Flavor follows aroma, with rich caramel malt, holiday spicing leaning towards gingerbread, light chocolate, finishes with cinnamon and light hop spicy bitterness. Really quite nice creamy medium bodied adds to the holiday festiveness. A very nicely made winter beer with holiday spicing that is well done and supported by the malt, which is selected well to support and allow light spices to be the centerpiece. Uncommon in my area, or I would add this to my winter holiday rotation.","LiquidAmber","Mar 27, 2014"

My first impression was of a good cordial cherry from out of the candy box, chocolate, cream, and a cherry finish. Boston had brought back memories of my childhood, minus the alcohol, on spot feeling of nostalgia. This beer definately impresses me because the goal has met with the impression, for me anyway. All the notes of a seasonal beer have been met, hazelnut, cinnamon, chocolate, coriander and cherries. This is a good beer to share with loved ones on the holidays.","Slagpile","Mar 07, 2014"

Alcohol is very subdued, but it doesn't carry warmer strength; perhaps, the most obvious flaw. I could use more oomph. This beer is smooth and tasty enough to handle it. Very soft bitterness is leftover from mild Noble hopping. Carbonation ruffles it up a bit more, but she's smooth and malty. A real treat this time of year.","thecheapies","Jan 19, 2014"

The flavor is dark fruity caramelized sugars with a hint of mineral water and a whole of spices. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel.

Scents of cinnamon, slight ginger and orange peel, some sweet malt and some yeasty funk. A pretty good, very sweet aroma. Taste begins with sweet, molasses malt, moving into some sweet spices in the middle, including a bit of cinnamon spice and finishing with more cinnamon spiciness. A bit of ginger spiciness is also present in the background, along with some orange peel, some dark fruit, mostly raisin, and bready malt in the middle. Spiciness is more present on the finish, ending the sip nicely. A very good winter warmer, with enough spice to make it to style, but not enough to detract from the malt. Well balanced and quite well done with a good variety of flavors. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Very nice. Overall this is a good winter warmer. I don't normally go for the style but this was a very good beer, balanced between sweet and spicy, not overly done in either area. Recommended.","Auraan","Jan 01, 2014"

Had to sniff a few times to figure out the aroma which is slightly chocolatey. Tastes ok and very light, somewhat sweet but not a lot of body. Slightly creamy. Can't detect much ginger or orange. I think I could drink a couple of these no problem. Was expecting a more complex beer upon reading the latest reviews. Again, not a bad beer, but then again, maybe I'm spoiled after experiencing so many other brews. A very decent beer that you can relax to.","Richardbeerlover","Dec 14, 2013"

Since the BROS have drank so much beer on their journey through the matrix we consider as an objective reality, and since their taste in beer is respected and quite honestly envied, any time they give a beer over a ninety rating I go buy it. I know that George Clooney has a good taste in women since he has sampled so many just like the BROS have a quality acquired taste in beer, and when I had this beer I felt as if I was Batman. I know it sounds wild, like Jennifer Lopez dating Maynard James Keenan from the progressive rock band TOOL, and even if that could only occur on Bizzaro's square planet, then good, I am fair with the hype that responds to the crowd as Shawn Kemp's massive thunderous dunks rocked Chicago Bulls stadium in the Reinman's heyday.

Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, ginger, cinnamon, citrus peel, chocolate, nutmeg, brown sugar, dark bread, light roasted malt, and light grassy hops. Damn nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt/spice notes. Taste of toffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ginger, light citrus peel, raisin, dark bread, and grassy hops. Lingering notes of toffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, chocolate, dark bread, cinnamon, ginger, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; with great robustness and balance of malt/spice flavors; and nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Christmas beer! Nice flavor balance with big robustness; and very smooth to drink. This was a very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 24, 2013"

Aroma of caramel malt with light toffee and nutmeg notes is pretty enticing. Taste is a good mix between some solid caramel malt with light notes of nutmeg and balanced residual sugar in the aftertaste. Body is about average with good carbonation.

3.62,-4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"not my favorite winter warmer, but a unique one. it pours a mostly impenetrable brown color with a real small tanish head. the smell is quite spices, cinnamon, citrus peel, and brown sugar. flavor is pretty moderate on the malts, some caramel and english wintery feeling grains, but i taste all spice in the middle, and all brown sugar or molassas in the finish, its not s sweet as that, but the flavor is the same. its almost mapley too, and as such might lend itself well to some time on wood. big mouthfeel, lots of body and some really bold flavors, vanilla tinge too, and the carbonation is fine. its a good winter beer i guess, but its not a drinker, its a slow sipper and one was plenty for me. it was honestly one of my least favorite beers in this years winter pack though, and i will likely let someone else drink the other couple of them.","StonedTrippin","Nov 28, 2012"

Not too strong at 5.8% abv, very enjoyable and tastes a bit better when it isn't too cold.

The taste, initial sip, was a slight surge of Alcohol, sips after briing out the cinnemon spices and touch of orange. Definitely some caramel malt. The mouthfeel is medium body with good carbonation.

Smells and tastes heavily of nutmeg, cinnamon, and gingerbread dough. Very festive. A small nitpick I have is that the citric peel hopping could stand to be somewhat more forward relative to the other characteristics of this brew. All the other hopping aspects are firmly in the earth toned spectrum, and that is perfectly fine by me. Texture is again slightly thin and watery relative to the flavors that it is supposed to support, but the carbonation is also kind of sluggish as well. For a winter warmer, it satisfies, but it could have been much better with just a little bit of fine tuning.","WastingFreetime","Feb 16, 2012"

I'm not usually big into the winter warmers, but this one has always been a good one for me. Why o why don't they make a six pack of this for christmas time, i don't know.

3.88,2.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, I find this to be a well-balanced beer, and thankfully moderate in its application of spices.

4.03,6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"My aggro pour netted me not only some cascading action but also two foamy fingers' worth of mocha-tan head with good retention.

Milk chocolate and cinnamon, to be more precise. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant cinnamon/clove (the neck label mentioned ginger) flavor in the mouth. Finish had more of the chocolate taste that I experienced on the nose. My, but this was good on a snow day when the schools were closed, I shoveled my walk early and simply spent the day chillaxing, as my students would say.

The taste is similar to some Belgian Ales out there, the spices really come through and mix with the citrusy notes this beer has.

4.09,8.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, Old Fezziwig Ale is another solid beer from Sam Adams. Although it's listed as a winter warmer, it has traits that make it similar to a Belgian Dark Ale.

Right off the bat this doesn't look like your normal SA beer. Its also one of the few SA's that doesn't have that classic SA taste. Not sure what it is but most have a certain note(Maybe the yeast) that gives it that SA characteristic. This really hits the spot on a cold day and as I said winter warmer is a really overlooked style, I believe this is caused by its lack of a wow factor. They're not too heavy and not too light which keeps the customer from coming back for more. Overall a good beer, don't think i'd buy it again but I will however look forward to it coming in my SA variety packs. Stay thirsty my friends.","NickRivers","Apr 03, 2011"
3.92,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Taste is malty and roasty, with a sweet spiciness. Definitely cold weather beer, with a nice warming sensation (and little trace of the alcohol). This one is different and has a unique flavor, and is also quite drinkable.","secondtooth","Apr 01, 2011"

It does give a great first impression, pouring with a rich, garnet-tinged brown color and topped with a thick, creamy, sand-colored head. The aroma is quite inviting, with fresh cherries, caramel, and biscuits all melding into a wonder malty sweetness. There is something a bit off about the flavor, though. All of the same sweet malt characteristics are there, but there is also a dull, nondescript bitterness that is presumably from the aging combination of spices and hops (although I am drinking before the best-by date). There is a solid body and a pleasant, moderate carbonation, but the texture can't right the wrongs from the flavor. Overall, there is certainly something a little different and enticing about this beer, but the weird bittering really detracts from the overall impression.","devilben02","Mar 29, 2011"

I poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a very dark reddish brown color and produced a thick white head. The lacing of this beer was outstanding. The aroma was filled with a spicy mix of ginger and cinnamon. Medium body and had traces of chocolate and burnt malt. Slight traces of ginger were also present. The finish was nice and warm.

I find the mouth feel to be smooth with ample carbonation as to not be cloying.

Dark sweet cherries with a toffee background supported by a deep malty profile. I guess I would say the smell reminds me of fruitcake. Sweet malty flavor with dark fruit undertones. Mostly raisins and sweet cherries with a bit of spiciness; probably along the lines of cloves and rainbow peppercorn. Finish with a linger caramel flavor. The body is full and the flavor lingers with a kind of dry finish. Good easy drinking on this with great flavor.

Deep mahogany liquid fills the glass, topped with a very full and rich light beige head. Deep amber hues in the light, quite clear. There are thick ribbons of lace where the froth adhered, leaving a decent smattering of bubbles everywhere. A swirl and a waft brings forth a beautiful aroma of deeply caramelized sugar, a warm fruity tone reminiscent of raisins and prunes, and a brighter, nutty tone that accompanies holiday spices. The first sip of Fezziwig for the season brings forth a nice biscuity flavor that transforms into a cornucopia of nutmeg, cinnamon, black currants, and maybe even a hint of pepper! The second sip enunciates these characteristics even more and gives rise to a light herbal bitterness that appears towards the end of the experience and lasts long into the finish, accompanied by a beautiful balance of Christmas potpourri spices. All of this is carried by a full bodied, velvety brown ale with exceptionally smooth carbonation. I finally see the light. This beer represents Christmas by Sam Adams. The first day that this winter mixer appears on the shelves is the first day of the holiday season. This beer, although I didn't know it at the time, was the reason I bought the pack.","DmanGTR","Dec 10, 2010"

The body is really quite perfect, it's thick and smooth with light carbonation that makes the whole experience very mellow. It's quite an easy drinker for the style and the alcohol is well hidden.

Now it's my box, so I've got some to sample. It pours a clear dark ruby-brown topped by a short half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises anise, light roasted malts, figs, raisins, rye bread, nutmeg, and a decent amount of banana. The taste runs similarly, with the rye bread taking up more space than before, and a cola-like flavor rising up as well. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, grainy feel. Overall, a very nice brew, not spectacular, but very tasty and highly drinkable. I can see why, to some degree, anyway, that people wait around for the SA Winter Styles pack every year.","TMoney2591","Nov 07, 2010"

4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"One of my favorite craft beers of all time, I love me some good malt. This beer pours a nice mahogany with ruby twinges adorned by a dirty ecru froth. The smell is really quite pleasant. Sweet malt aroma is all-encompassing, but there is a distinct orange zest aroma that is meshed nicely with the ginger and cinnamon. It's rare that the aroma matches the description on the bottle so directly. This beer tastes just as it smells with the sugary sweetness that would be expected from a beer as malty as this and the spices match up nicely. The flavor of steeped oranges is a bit stronger than I would have liked, but I still really enjoy this beer. This mouthfeel is really nice and smooth, perhaps a bit undercarbonated making it seem slightly too viscous, but it's well above the threshold of dislike. This is a really nice drinkable beer for the cold weather, and one of my all-time favorite Sam Adams beers.","Vdubb86","Nov 04, 2010"

Smells a lot like ginger, almost reminds me of ginger ale, some faint citrus and spice from the cinnamon. The smell of this beer is unbalanced from the ginger spice. Cannot detect any deep roasted malts, or any malts for that matter. Fortunately the taste is a bit more balanced, some spritely carbonation on the tongue followed by ginger spice, and some citrus and light hop cleansing, but the hops nor the malts provide much flavor profile. Kinda disappointing. Taste is also slightly vinous characteristic of the darker Boston Beers. Overall I cannot drink much of these from all the damn ginger, and I am confused why they decided to make the Winter lager which has exactly the same spices as this one, but instead of an ale is a lager, but from memory is a bit more balanced?

The remainder of the smell consists of Christmas spices and dried fruit. The taste is a little bit better along the same lines as the smell. It's very sweet, caramelized malts.

The aroma is malt forward with dark fruit, subtle alcohols, and maybe just a hint of the ginger peeking thru. No hop aroma. In flavor it is malt forward again with some slight dark fruit and toasty caramel with what appears to be a dark malt addition that helps to dry this beer in the same way that roasted barley helps to dry a scottish ale. There is a low-moderate and balancing bitterness that keeps this beer drinkable. This is an enjoyable beer that I wish was dialed up just a bit in strength. My bottle calls a 5.9% abv, I would like to try this beer just a touch bigger and richer. Overall though, very nice.","adammills","Dec 10, 2009"

Mostly the flavor is dominated by chocolate; vanilla, pumpkin pie spices and a woody dry bitter finish. A tasty pleasant winter beer here. There is a bit of a tongue prickle here I can't tell if it is the ginger or the carbonation. Mouthfeel is quite good, very fine carbonation gives this a creamy mouthfeel.","Anthony1","Dec 10, 2009"

Quite enjoyable, the orange shows at the very end as a feeling within the mouth more than the OJ taste. I see nothing wrong with drinking a few of these.

Light and slightly plain for a winter warmer. This has loads more flavor than the usual sam adams flavors. The thick taste coats the tongue and prevents quick drinking, but the taste is good and compared to many winter warmers I've had 5.6% is sessionable.

End of the sip has some spice mainly noticed in the ginger aftertaste. Overall a solid beer. Can't say anything bad about the beer.

You can barely make out some trace amounts of aroma hops as well. Take a deep gulp and you get a great crisp beer with what I think is some cinnamon or other form of spice.

The flavors were also on-point for the Winter Warmer style and quite enjoyable. I tasted orange peel first, lots of gingerbread again, caramel malt, chocolate malt, cinnamon and nutmeg.

Aside from that, there's a little zest up front not to be confused with the sourness, something like the orange or coriander you'd get from a wit. Rich and bubbly mouthfeel keeps things lively. Nice balanced medium body, not overly coating yet not real watery, either. Not the greatest thing ever, but a nice little session beer for the winter months.

The aftertaste could use a bit more bitterness, but the malt is a so nice that it's not a big complaint.

4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I hadn't had one of these beers in years, and I've never reviewed it, so I decided to grab a 12 of the winter pack from this brewery and try one again. Pours a medium reddish brown with good clarity and an okay head that settles to a thin ring. Smells a bit like a wassail cup with malt, spice and citrus peel, as well as a bit of cherry. Pretty similar in taste, and there is a nice mellow bitterness throughout, as well as gentle malt and chocolate flavors. Very smooth and somewhat creamy, but there is also a touch of chalkiness in the mouthfeel and a hint of spicy ginger in the finish. Smooth and somewhat porter-like in overall feel, but a bit sweeter. I like this as an alternative to some other Christmas beers. Mellow and tasty.","Georgiabeer","Dec 13, 2008"

Fairly smooth and light to medium bodied on the palate. The flavor is sweet caramel malt with some more cinnamon and perhaps other spices common in the holiday season. Some bitterness toward the end as well. The beer finishes with a strange hollow spicy aftertaste. This beer is well balanced but still comes off a little peculiar to me. I would say hype and the exclusive holiday packaging is the genius of this one.","BeardedBoffin","Dec 13, 2008"

Foam eventually receded into a band of bubbles around the perimeter and a soapy slick in the center. Some spatterings of lacing present during the tasting. Nose was malty with a touch of nutmeg, but also a little metallic. Malt, nutmeg, cinnamon and caramel revealed in the mouth with a light hops bittering towards the back; flavorful without being cloying.

Taste: big malt sweetness - caramel and a touch of chocolate, but not overly sweet. Out of the spices, the cinnamon is the most prominent, moreso than in the winter lager.

Aroma is toasty caramel and light milk chocolate with obvious notes of the added ginger, orange, and cinnamon.

Taste has caramel malt backbone with noticable yet subtle spices. i dont taste ginger per se but i get a certain ginger snappiness along with the cinnamon. Orange peel compliments the bitterness with a slightly sweet twinge. Medium bodied in relative terms, pretty full bodied for the style. Easy drinking. I remember having this on Christmas a few years back when I first started getting into beer. Loved it then, love it now. This really makes me look forward to Old Jubilation and Anchor Christmas. Jim Koch should scrap the 2 boston lagers in the 12 pack and add 1 or 2 more of these.","redmagik99","Oct 30, 2008"

The beer is a ruby red/brown colour with a little head that fades away pretty quickly. The taste of the beer is chocolaty, sweet, and the bitterness comes through with the spices. I mainly taste cinnamon, because I don't really know what ginger tastes like. The sweetness reminds me of plums mixed with a small bit of chocolate. The beer is pretty complex, actually. Each time I take a drink I get a bit more flavour than before. The mouth feel is pretty good. The beer is decently drinkable.

The aroma gives a fairly delicate sweetness of nutmeg and malt, nothing too heavy but you detect a hint of HO, HO HO here. The flavor comes across pretty much in the medium range as compared to most holiday beers. I get lots of malt blended with the spice highlights. I do sense citrus for sure though it is not obviously orange as advertized on the label, and the cinnamon & ginger are also not so obvious but the spice is there without overwhelming the result. I pick up some charcoal and even raisin to boot. As this sort of thing goes I would call it pretty drinkable, alcohol does not seem to be an issue here, not really evident. It is mildly carbonated with a somewhat aqueous feel, not really watery though. A decent option if you want that holiday feel for more than 1 or 2 bottles worth. Worth a try.","Durge","Jul 20, 2008"

Body is moderate to perhaps a bit rich and surprisingly so. Hint of spice and cinnamon present and this is growing on me as it opens up after a few minutes. Maybe a hint of the noted orange is present in the finish, but I'm not even sure actually. Maybe just a faint tartness from the malt or hops. Slightly drying in the end as well.

It had a sweet and toasty aroma of toasted malts, buttered popcorn, chestnuts, candy sugar, and a small dash of cinnamon and ginger. The taste was slightly toasted with candy sugar, toasted malts, chestnuts, cinnamon, orange spice, plums, and then it ended with some toasted bitter hops. It was a medium bodied beer that had a full flavored aftertaste of plums, toasted malts, sugar, and a dash of cinnamon and orange spice. Basically, this beer tasted like Christmas.

Light amount of malt sweetness, but mostly toasted malts with some citrus coming in around the edges. A bit of nutty earth and bitter chocolate in the finish.

Other than that it seems mostly like toasted malt, like it was brewed with a lot of Munich and/or victory malt. The taste was heavily toasted malt and spices were apparent though not overwhelming. You really had to look for the spices, which were hard to taste individually, except maybe the cinnamon. The mouthfeel is really good, especially for a festive winter type ale because it has a good body on it but not too hard to drink. This is the type of beer that feels like you could sit around with it during the holidays and drink pretty easily while it gives you a good satisfying taste.","MiScusi","Dec 28, 2007"

Speaking of taste, something just isnt right here. Not that its terrible, but of the winter beers I've tried thus far this is my least favorite. Very heavy again on the malt.

The front taste is all malts that gives way to the ginger and cinnamon tastes and finished by a little bit of a piney hops bite. I wasn't able to detect any orange even though there seemed to be some in the smell. This beer has a nice full mouthfeel but might be a little to heavy to drink more than one or two of at a time. If spiced beer is your thing, this beer's definitely worth a try.","TheTrevor","Dec 21, 2007"

1.96,-48,3,2,2,2,1.5,"Personally, I found this to be a little bit of a malty mess. Alcohol (thought the beer isn't that strong) manages to muddle in with the caramel malt so it doesn't have a clear character. On the sweet side, with no bitter character to balance it out. I'm all for a "winter warmer" but honestly this was a bit like bad candy sugar. More alcohol to counteract the sweetness and a stopgap on the caramel would help this beer tremendously to become a true "Winter Warmer".","TheDeuce","Dec 17, 2007"

Aroma is big on cinnamon, orange, and ginger, but none of these flavorings are overpowering. Has a decent malt base that gives off a brown sugar feel in the nose. Flavor is rather cinnamon forward. It would seem to me that cassia "cinnamon" is used here rather than Ceylon cinnamon, giving it more of a wood shaving flavor. Aside from that, the sweetness rides too high here and aside from the spicing, the beer is rather lacking. Cloying sweetness ruins it. Mouthfeel is moderate and has a mild carbonation. Drinkability?

The smell is pleasantly spicy with a backbone of cinnamon and nutmeg supporting a toasty malt nose. Slight alcohol presence. Hops aroma is absent, yet fitting for the style. The taste is similar to the nose. The sweet and toasty malt combines with the winter spices and strong alcohol warming to create a pleasant winter warmer. Hops flavor and bitter are as absent as the aroma. Medium-bodied with moderately high carbonation. The carbonation adds a bit of bite to the tongue.

This is really one of the best seasonal brews that Sam Adams offers, making the Holiday season all the sweeter. The only drawback is that Sam Adams doesn't market Old Fezziwig in six packs. Too bad.

Leaves nice lacing as the head creeps down the glass. Lots of aroma in this beer. Foamy, chocolaty malt, roasted and nutty with brown sugar and cinnamon in the back. Full in flavor that starts like a brown ale and finishes dry and tart. The orange is what I believe pokes out right at the end that gives the tart flavor to an overall malty and porter-like beer. The roasted flavor is characteristic of a porter, but the lighter body makes it almost like a spiced schwartzbier. The body is clean and smooth with rich and mellow roasted malt.

I've been a big fan of SA's Winter Lager for some time, but this was my first try of Old Fezziwig, and was I surprised at the jump up. Now that's probably due to my inherent preference of ales to lagers. While the lager seems to be spiced the ale has fully accepted the flavors and plays them out beautifully.

Strong caramel malt flavor up front mixed roasted tones and a mild touch of spice. Slight hint of a cinnamon or nutmeg in the aftertaste. Slight hop presence although it is really quite tamed by the heavy malt tones. Nice drink ability, flavor is very smooth and enjoyable.

The flavors all balance each other nicely and the flavors do become a bit stronger as the beer starts to warm. The only drawback is that there are so many flavors going on here that they all seem to be a bit bland and nothing really stands out. Maybe there should be a smaller number of different flavors in order for greater emphasis to be placed on a few specific ones. this beer has a medium body with a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.

Clean otherwise, with perhaps a bit of english hops coming through. Some caramel and apple skin, as well. The flavor starts with warm, caramel brown-ness, cushioned with the holiday spices. Ginger is again most prominent, but I feel like I'm getting nutmeg with the ginger/cinnamon combo. Orange shows through with some citrus zest into the finish. A light touch of sweet, phenolic smoke. Bittersweet, chocolatey roast takes up the finish with tobacco and urbane, woody english hops. Fairly light on the palate, with softer, finely bubbled carbonation.

Although I love this beer, I'm not sure that I could drink it as a session beer, but its a great beer to have, to start your evening off right.

Decent mouthfeel, and not so fruity that you couldn't drink a few.","lordofthewiens","Nov 22, 2006"

The taste here is nice and malty but this is balanced by the spices which aren't overpowering. Finish is dry with a slight malty aftertaste. Maybe a bit thin for my pleasure but it is still has very acceptable mouthfeel. This beer is easy to drink low to moderate abv with spices that don't overpower makes this one highly drinkable.

Palate is all-malt up front, with just a subtle amount of spices and hop balance. The spiciness is definitely not overkill here - very subtle. Finishes much drier than it starts, with a decent amount of hop acidity. Mouthfeel is okay, but maybe a slight bit too thin. I'd like to see a bit more substance here in the mouth. This would make this a very good winter warmer ... as it is, though, it's really just average. Worth a try, but not a top shelf WW.","beerphilosopher","Nov 16, 2006"

Malts dominate with caramel and cocoa present. Next are spices, tastes like cinnamon, ginger, and maybe some molasses. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a nice dry finish.

I'd certainly have it again. Easily the third-best selection in the sampler, after the excellent Holiday Porter and Black Lager. I wish there were more in the sampler or it was available on its own -- it makes for a nice pairing with cold-weather comfort foods.","eberkman","Nov 13, 2006"
4.08,8.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This has a very dark brown color with a nice foamy head. The most pronounced flavor is the caramel malt, which is perfectly complimented by a slight cinnamon flavor. The spices are not overpowering (like some pumpkin ales), but add just the right amount of flavor without obscuring the malt or hop flavors (the balance of which is perfect). The mouthfeel is very smooth, but a little heavy. An excellent seasonal brew, this is the perfect beer for sitting in front of a fire while the snow falls outside. As far as drinkability, I do not even feel that I can apply the same standard to this beer as I would most others. In warmer weather, I would not consider this the most drinkable beer, due largely to the heaviness. As this is a winter brew, however, the heaviness is a welcome characteristic. This beer perfectly captures the mood of the Christmas season.","CardinalBrewing","Nov 12, 2006"

The taste has bitter dark chocolate and sweet roasted malts, and some burnt malts up front and orange in the back. Ginger is apparent but is a bigger factor in the finish where it teams up with some more orange notes. Hop addition is pretty substantial and make for a terrific balance along side the spices.

Immediatly afterward, I noticed the smell. I hesitate to say it knocked me over, because it was such a pleasant aroma, but the smell was extremely strong. I didn't need to "waft" at all, just to pouring opened up my nasal senses. The least best thing about this ale was the mouthfeel, but that is not to say that it was bad at all.

There was low hop bitterness apparent. There was a very light memory of sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and dry with medium-full body and modest carbonation.

When I drink this, the hops come out of nowhere (didn't get it that much in the nose), but there's some new maltyness to balance it out as well. All of the spices are there from the nose, but I also get some orange now. It surprising how smooth it finishes, a little sweeter than I would normally expect also.

Smells of lots of cinnamon and ginger, and some orange peel on top of a slight malty base, but not much as its hard to pick up, mostly because the cinnamon is more intense. Really quite nice. Mouthfeel is carbonated up front, then melts into a smooth finish with a tinge of alcohol warming. Surprisingly, I don't get as much of the cinnamon in the taste, but get the malts and ginger, and I think a trace of orange peel in the middle, maybe some raisin, and maybe just maybe some hop in there.

Smells pretty good, with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and there is also some caramel, maple, and a hint of citrus. Great christmas brew aroma, excuse me, bouquet. Not bad, if only slightly weak in the nose. The taste adds a chocolate-mousse dimension, but again it is slightly weak. Nice, I just wish there was a little more depth in the malt 'backbone' or hops. Also, the flavors (mostly spices) are solid in themselves, but they don't seem to quite come together too well on my palate. Has a surprisingly dry finish to it, with the hops making their appearance in the after taste (bringing a bitter fruit element to the taste). Not bad, but not fantastic either.

Smells spicy and sweet, namely cinnamon and cloves, along with notes of orange,chocolate, and caramel. Tastes just as it smells once the initial rush of carbonation allows the palate to taste, finishes malty and sweet. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but once the carbonation falls off, the beer is slick and smooth on the tongue.

The clear body was deep reddish amber in color with an ample beige head. The aroma was dominated by the spices mentioned on the label, namely cinnamon, ginger, and orange. The taste was more malty than spicy, with toffee, gingerbread, and cookie dough like sweetness. The spices were lurking just in the background and made the palette dry as they were detected. Creamy mouthfeel was enhanced by the very soft carbonation. Very little hops detected, except maybe with a little floral flourish in the bouquet, and a tiny hint of bitterness towards the end of each swallow.

This is a fairly complex ale and is therefore best if served just slightly cool. The appearance is really lovely. It has sort of a glowing red-brown appearance that is really inticing with some nice white lacing. You can really smell the bouqet of spices; in particular, the cirtus and cinammon really show up along with LOTS of malt aroma. The taste follows suit; the caramel and chocolate malts are pretty prominent, as they should be. A twist of noble hops provides balance, and accents the sweet malts perfectly.

Taste: Darker roasted malts bring a roasty sweetness, somewhat tart and bitter with orange peel and ginger additions coating the palate a bit mixes well with slightly burnt roasts. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied solid carbonation flows nicely for some holiday cheer.

As much as I dislike not being able to buy sixers of this, it would almost seem disappointing not to have to purchase the whole Holiday mix pack. Old Fezzi pours a dark reddish amber with almost purple highlights. A large fluffy tan head forms, eventually yielding to lace. The aroma is very nice, a deep malty sweetness evokes many sweet flavors like sugar plums and candy. In the background is nutmeg and/or cinnamon. The taste is very sweet due to a very strong malt base. There are candy flavors and fruit flavors that meld to create a unique candied fruit impression. Sugar plum fairies maybe. There is some brown sugar towards the finish followed by a slight bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. The mouthfeel is silky and soft. The drinkability is good in the sense that I love drinking the stuff, but suffers somewhat in that I probably wouldn't ever want more than 1 (maybe 2) on a given night.

I taste cinnimon, and ginger. Maybe cloves also. This beer has a slightly malty sweet taste. I do not taste any hop presence. This beer goes down very smooth leaving a spicy ginger like aftertaste. I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. It has a mild, very good taste. It is not strong in alcohol, so you can drink a lot. I think this is a very good beer.

It is in the taste where I am able to pick up the spices, at lease cinnamon, which goes well with the malt flavors.

Nose was spices, gingerbread, almost a pumkin-pie scent there somewhere among the dark malt. It hits the mouth with a smooth moderate mouthfeel, velvety carbonation.

Unfortunately, I can't really taste much of that. There's a nice bitterness in the hops, but nothing else seems to be going on. The beer feels very thin too, just not much to it. It doesn't taste bad, just not a lot of complexity. On the plus side, the drinkability is great.","JackStraw22","Dec 20, 2004"

Mouthfeel is slightly thin due some unexpected carbonation. Not overly thin, but enough to warrant a slightly lower score in my opinion.

Taste isn't quite as good as the aroma but it's good nonetheless. There's a lot of sweet maltiness upfront, the top middling, and the finish is slightly citric and spicy. The malts have trouble distinguishing themselves. There's a chocolate aspect in there that kind of muddles the flavors. The spices are the same way. I can't really discern each spice but rather taste a generally spice flavor. There is a citric tartness at the end but the beer finishes with a hoppy spiciness and slight dryness. I think I'd be satisfied with about 2 of these but I liked it nonetheless. Also, it seemed to improve as it warmed.

The flavor is every bit complex,raisins, caramel,ginger,cinnamon and nice mix of hops at the end, but is smooth and perfectly blended.

You do occasionally get a little hint of cinnamon or ginger. After the spice, you taste some coffee notes and sweet carmel malts. Minimal hop flavor. Medium-bodied with low carbonation.

4.35,15.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Fezziwig name couldn't be more appropriate for such a rich and lively ale. Its reddish-chestnut body displays glowing ruby highlights and its creamy ivory head holds well and leaves some nice lace about the glass. Rich, caramel-soaked and hop-infused malt dominates the nose, beckoning you to take another whiff where subtle spicing may be found. In the mouth its fine, median carbonation gently zests on the tongue before warming to become just slightly creamy. The spicing is far from over-done, and simply lends a bit of extra character and depth to an already rich brew. Deeply caramelized malts abound, and a touch of dark chocolate helps to anchor it although that's where the hops come into play. Much like the spicing, they play a supporting role, but a full on at that. The bitterness is firm enough to balance the sweetness of the malts, but never surpasses that function; and the grassy and floral hop flavors help to thin the richness of the malt so that it doesn't appear as "sweet", all the while adding breadth of character. The cinnamon, ginger and orange perk up in the finish as the dark caramel subsides, allowing you to notice them more at the start of the next sip. Like a bright, well-orchestrated symphony, Fezziwig evolves with each new movement, adding new layers to its themes without losing focus, and ending with a brilliant crescendo once the beer has warmed. It may not be quite the beer it once was, but it's certainly worth buying the winter seasonal case to have it on hand when friends and relatives drop by. An exceptional holiday beer!","NeroFiddled","Jun 21, 2004"

The aroma was the best part of this beer to me- it was a combination of sweet fruits (apples & cherries) and spices (cinnamon) that was somewhat bready, kind of like the way you always hope fruitcake will taste (but it never does). The flavor was a bit surprising, in that the aroma did not follow through as much as I would expect. The flavor was much more sharp than sweet, with spices (cloves & others I can't identiy) coming though much sharper than the bready fruits. Not a bad thing, just surprising. It finished with a warming alcohol glow. Overall- not a bad brew, but I was surprised by the switch from aroma to taste.

Likewise, the taste is decidedly spicy...I get an awful lot of ginger...with a very pleasing maltiness underneath. Caramel and toasted qualities are very nice.

The taste is kind of funky, with a strong oaky character atop roasted caramel and a bit of pine resins. Husky sharpness in the finish wrapped in a slight bitterness. Decent smoke component as well. This brings to mind clenaing out the fireplace, with a bit of smoke in the throat to accompany the sooty coating on the tongue and gritty mouthfeel. Feels like wintertime on the farm once again.

I also tasted a burntness to the malt flavor. Hop flavor was minimal, pretty much masked by the spice. Hop bitterness was also unnoticable. It was relatively light in body, with minimal carbonation.

Full mouthfeel, dominant malt that lasts to the finish and is just slightly leavened with prickly hops and slight acid in the aftertaste. To be honest, there may be a very good beer in here, but this is a little over-the-top in added ginger, as opposed to other spices. A little unidimensional in overall impression but a not a bad beer.

A solid winter ale although I'd love to see them be a little more aggressive with this beer. IMO, 3rd best beer in the pack behind the Winter Lager and the Boston Lager.

I love the smells: orange with hints of caramelized orange peel, candied ginger, just a hint of cinnamon, and just the whisper of hops. Taste is sweet without being cloying, with just a touch of ginger and cinnamon on top of an orange fruitiness. There's a slight roasted, almost espresso aspect, with hints of chocolate. For as much as there is going on in this beer, it's all blended and balanced exceptionally well. Moderate to low carbonation makes for a fairly easy drinking beer.

Festive aroma of spicy cinnamon and freshly grated ginger layered over dark caramel and dry cocoa. Trace earthy hop nose. Flavorwise, dark caramel malt sweetness upfront yields to combination of pronounced spicy melange of cinnamon and light spruce. Spiciness couples with underlying biscuit malt, lending an impression of frankincense and baked sugary biscuits mid palate. Chocolate malt undertone adds some complexity. The light hop bitterness leaves malt sweetness unhindered overall. A touch shy in body to support the rich spice and bready malt profile, but pleasantly smooth in mouthfeel. Subdued earthy and lightly woody hop flavor. Finishes w/ hints of burnt caramel and bread crust quickly fading. Old Fezziwig is a very enjoyable and certainly well spiced brew. With a greater malt presence this would be more balanced and thus more drinkable. Quite tasty, nonetheless.","marc77","Nov 23, 2002"

The lacing was sparse as only specks of foam remained. The nose is very pleasant, surprisingly good potency; the maltiness is very sturdy with hints of chocolate and whiffs of orange peel. The palate is a touch thinner in taste than the nose indicates, the maltiness up front is bland, in the middle a light dusting of spices mingles with an orange peel, a kiss of warmth, a smidge of hops, in the finish the malt is again noticeable, chocolate influences. As a whole the flavor profile is solid, far from spectacular, a modest spice beer/winter warmer. The aftertaste is a little muddled, a little blunt. Medium in body with carbonation that is modest in its effervescence, the mouthfeel is neutral and uninspiring. There is a mild belly warming sensation. Is Fezziwig worth buying the Winter Classic Set for two bottles? That is very debatable, IÂ’d say noÂ… yet I buy it every year!

Sam Adams beers almost always do great in the appearance and head retention department. What an aroma! Ginger, cinnamon, and orange peel are all present, along with sweet malt. Caramel mostly, some chocolate, and a bit of toasted character. More intense spice aroma than Winter Lager, but a bit similar because of the spices used. The three spices are the mainstay of the palate as well. Cinnamon and orange peel mostly, but ginger isn't far behind. More toasted and chocolate malt backing them up, with a little less caramel than I expected having noted the aroma, but still a generous amount. Coats the tongue in spicy caramel sweetness. A bit of a warming alcohol presence. Rich, yet medium body. A great festive beer that's perfect for the holidays. I really wish these were available in six packs, however, I'm just happy that they keep putting this beer out at all, there being so many Sam Adams beers that are no longer produced.

3.3,-12.5,4,4,3,3,3,"The first time I had this, I was not a fan, but it grew on me.  Of course, the last time I had it I had the Christmas carols jamming, a Santa hat on my head and my 3 year old kid and I were decking the tree, so you could say the mood enhanced my liking of this beer.  Some cinnamon hints come through.  A nice holiday offering.","proc","Dec 11, 2001"
4.06,7.7,5,4,4,4,4,"A dark garnet color with a fluffy head. Almost a cinnomon(sp?) roll flavour. I had it with a piece of pumkin pie and the two went perfect together.","xXTequila","Nov 24, 2001"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"With all the attention this beer seems to be getting, I decided to go and buy the SA's Winter 12 pack.  Overall, I thought this was a nice winter brew, heavy on the dark malt, but with enough spices and draw attention.  Warms nicely.","AaronRed","Nov 18, 2001"

3.76,-0.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Can't believe I had to buy a 12 pack of mixed beers to try this - I'd buy a ton if I could.  Wonderful color, spicy and great mouthfeel - I only got two - This beer could get expensive.  Worth the effort, not sure about the price.","gwfrankpsu","Oct 28, 2001"
