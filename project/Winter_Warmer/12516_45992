Rich, smooth, mellow and sweet. Slight bitterness and warmth on the follow through. Full bodied, medium levels of carbonation, smooth finish.

4.14,4.5,,,,,,"12oz. bottle poured into  a snifter.  A reddish-brown color with a slight bubble to it.  Minimum head.  The smell is that of gingerbread, cinnamon and pinecones.  The taste is quite sweet, so if you like your christmas beer on the hoppy side, this one may not be for you.  The overwhelming taste, just like the smell, is the gingerbread, a touch of honey, & lots of spices present.  My palate not being the most defined in the world tastes cinnamon with a mixture of other tastes that i can't quite pinpoint.  No matter your palate though you can't get much closer to a taste that reminds you of Christmas. at 8.3% it's an easy drink and in my opinion is the most versatile "winter warmer" around, drink it Christmas morning as your family opens presents, enjoy it as a dessert beer after a holiday meal, or simply drink a couple to yourself as you watch a great sports game/movie/tv series etc on a cold winters day.

The smell is rich with spices and sweetness.  12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale put you in the mind set of Christmas cookies.  You also pick up a hit of grains and malts in the smell of this brew. The taste is rich with flavor, you pick up on the spices in this brew.  There is cinnamon and a hit of pumpkin spice.  This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in it. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. 12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale is a great drinking brew.  Thirsty Dog Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again.

Had to let the beer warm up to get that though. The flavor is bready with lots of darker malts, perhaps chocolate, but mostly crystal. The cinnamon pops up for a second but is quickly diminished.

This is an enjoyable winter warmer that is heavy on spices but isn't overly sweet as some winter warmers tend to be. Specifically, ginger, nutmeg, brown sugar, and cinnamon, in that order, stand out. The smell is even better than the taste. The alcohol is concealed better in the taste than maybe any beer I've ever tried, and that makes this one dangerous, especially considering how easy it goes down. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side and the carbonation is fairly low. For as much as there is going on, it finishes clean. Overall, this is a very good winter warmer that I would probably enjoy even more during the right season. I can't help but compare this to Great Lakes' Christmas Ale, which is much sweeter and a bit better, but both are recommended.","DeFaz","Sep 08, 2013"

Aromas of big honey, caramel, ginger, raisin, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, light clove, and light herbal. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, ginger, honey, raisin, apple, cinnamon, nuttiness, and light herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, honey, ginger, cinnamon, raisin, apple, and nuttiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt/spice flavors; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming present on the finish. Overall this is an excellent winter warmer. Nicely balanced and robust flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected; this is definitely the better offering vs the GL version.","superspak","Jan 08, 2013"

Trying the 12 Dogs of Christmas Ale...the beer poured a clear deep rich amber...almost brown....with a thin slightly off-white head that is not leaving much lace. The scents are quite nice...honey, cinnamon, giner and nutmeg....just like the bottle says. The taste starts with honey for sure, then the hops and alcohol begin to add a bitterness that makes the taste turn to pine needles. The mouthfeel is full bodied with subtle carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer and winter warmer is a good description...probably would not do more than one a night....just alot going on and the ABV is butt-kicking.","WoodBrew","Dec 25, 2012"

This beer doesn't have the greatest drinkability, I think the spices would wear on me after more then one bottle, one of these is the perfect amount, after that it is time for something else. What I liked most about this beer was the spice profile and the balance, they were pretty unique and didn't get too out of hand, the alcohol was also hidden very well. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance, the color was nice but the head was pretty lack luster and was hardy there. I would buy a six pack of this too keep around for the holidays. but I couldn't see buying more then that. I recommend this beer to any Winter Warmer fan, the spices are there but they aren't over the top. This was another good beer from Thirsty Dog, I find the that the key with this style is the balance and thankfully this beer had the right amount of balance. Another solid beer from Thirsty Dog, I like the slight twist that they put on their beers to make them stick out a little, I'm down to try more of what these guys have to offer.","StoutHunter","Dec 17, 2011"

I had the GL Chirstmas Ale again night and after that tasting last night, I can say that the two beers are quite different. This one is much sweeter, has a bit more boozy flavor to it that is quite noticeable, and the ginger in the Great Lakes makes it quite different than this one. Interestingly, both seem to have a tea-like bitter finish (same hops?) So now that I'm done comparing the two, what do I think? Definitely a winter warmer, but I'm not crazy about the solventy notes I get through the whole drink, even after it warmed up. The cinnamon and nutmeg are a nice touch, and it definitely warmed me up this evening so this is a Winter Warmer, just not a great one in my opinion.

It is a very well balanced beer, and can hardly taste the alcohol in it. It has a nice smooth feel to it that leaves a dry chalky feeling with some tart bitterness in the mouth, and it is quite drinkable for being on the dry side.

What stands out to me is the spicy ginger along with earthy and pine hops, of course a strong honey sweetness rides in the sidecar. Very complex and full of Christmas senses, supposedly the same recipe as the Great Lakes Christmas ale according to a recent thread, rumor? I'm not sure but it smells pretty close. Flavor is nice spices play nice with bitter and spicy edges, I'm getting Christmas spiced bread with powdered yeast drizzled with honey and caramel, let's not forget spruce tips and a raw earthy bitterness with just a touch of booziness about it. I can't believe this brew is scoring in the middle of the road category, because it's fantastic. I'm ready for a whole sixer better yet a mixed sixer half Great Lakes Christmas Ale and half of this fine brew. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with some thicker textures joining the party, some honey and some rough spice induced bitterness in the finish. Also some soothing alcohol burn that makes the whole experience work a little better, and drinkability wise it's pretty easy to drain a 12 ounce pour if you let your palate adjust to the honey and spices. Throw a cigar into the mix and it will hold up equally as well.","WVbeergeek","Dec 08, 2008"
3.78,-4.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a clear, dark copper color with a 3/4 inch head. Good lacing on the glass as I drink it. The taste is everything listed onthe bottle. This beer tastes like Christmas. It is similar to Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Cinnamon, nutmeg and in the background, honey and ginger. It is too high in alcohol to be a session beer, but the alcohol is hidden behind those spices. I like Old Leghumper from Thirsty Dog and now this one. It might be time to revisit their beers.","zsk","Dec 01, 2008"
3.8,-4,4,4,4,3,3.5,"So today I try 12 Dogs for the first time and also find out that they are local. I generally like spiced ales a lot (I like everthing). I've had a lot of Great Lake's Christmas Ale already this season. It is outstanding. 12 Dogs tastes very similar to the Great Lakes (to me). I will have to do a side by side taste test some day. The Thirsty Dog has more spice and not as creamy a finish. I wonder what it is like on tap. It would be great if it were a little stronger - really strong. Then all that spice could be hiding 12% alcohol.","schoolboy","Nov 28, 2008"
2.8,-29.3,3,3,3,3,2,"Pours a relatively clear, darker shade of amber with minimal head. Not much lacing to mention. Smells VERY strongly of nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice. Smells of relatively nothing but holiday-like spices, and very strongly. Taste is much the same...strong nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, subtle hop spice...malty. Decent carbonation, medium bodied. Very sweet and spicy. One bottle is enough. Not totaly impressed.","Doomcifer","Nov 26, 2008"
4.16,5.1,2.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a kinda thin head that goes down quickly, no lacing. Scents of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla bristle through. Tastes very much as to what it smells like. Very pleasant and easy drinking with nice spices. Not a beer you can guzzle, but nice to have one around the fireplace. Deceptively strong, beware and be careful. True to the style of this spicey beer.","bigdeuce","Nov 22, 2008"
