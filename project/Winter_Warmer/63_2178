3.8,-3.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Not as syrupy sweet or hyper-spiced as most winter warmers.  The malty Carmel taste is refreshing at first, with a slightly bitter, hoppy finish.  This one has a mild skunk at the end, probably because it almost Easter and a bit late for a winter warmer.  Of course the high today was in the mid- 20's and this is warming me up nicely.","DDiFran","Mar 09, 2015"

4.42,12.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Very well balanced ! Normally I like my winter warmers to be a little sweeter. But with this one I don't mind.   Just the right mix of flavors .(If it was sweeter it might ruin that mix). Perfect for the thanksgiving meal every year.","pianoguy","Mar 09, 2015"

3.98,1.3,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Pours a two finger light brown, foamy head, with good retention and some spots of sticky lacing. Mahogany and slightly cloudy. Smells like candied dates and raisins. Taste is what I expect from the aroma, with a bittering finish. Lingering sensation of dark, dried fruits, as well as some plum. Feel is on thicker side and low carbonation. Light chewiness and somewhat viscous. A fun winter style beer and a good buy for the price.","sporklift87","Mar 01, 2015"
3.58,-8.9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is molasses, caramelly, dark and sweet chocolate with slight barky hops.  This makes for a nice bock like beer.  A good winter warmer, although there are others in the style that I prefer.","tigg924","Mar 01, 2015"

3.71,-5.6,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Ruby red in the light. Thin lacing of head. Great color. Hint of tobacco, light nose overall, backbone of solid malts. Warm spicy and nicely blended. A bit of bright hop bitterness on the end . Some alcohol. Some murk in essence overall, but good residual carryover of spice and hint of yeast. Overall nice. Love some Deschutes, maybe earlier in the season next time?","Mikus","Feb 26, 2015"
3.78,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"2/28 - Bottle.  Nice reddish brown pour with good body. Not a strong smell, but malt and spices were noticeable.  Nice pour and a very good taste of herbs and orange. Felt good going down and had a decent kick. Overall very good beer and I'll be seeking this out down the road.","dukeandduke","Feb 24, 2015"

4.01,2,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Finally! I feel like I can really call myself a beer lover now. I've tried one of Deschutes original beers. 2014 was silky smooth, hints of chicory and cherry, rounded by a huge malt finish. A hint of citrus zest but all together a great winter warmer. Warmed me right up! Do you expect anything less from Deshutes though? They're the best. A very good beer!","cheers_chick","Feb 21, 2015"
