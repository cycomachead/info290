4.4,18.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"If you are not into spiced beers, stop reading now. This Is not the beer for you. If, however, you enjoy a nicely sweet holiday ale with a high enough ABV to warm you on a cold night, this is a good one. I poured this into a standard pint glass. The fizzy beige head dissipated quickly, leaving a trace of foam atop the dark reddish brown body. Cinnamon and ginger dominated the taste, leaving a very pleasant sweetness behind. It had a rich, semi-thick mouthfeel. This functions nicely as a dessert beer, or as an evening sipper. I'm planning on picking up a couple more of these.","JohnCJr","Jan 03, 2015"

3.5,-5.9,,,,,,"Very deep red color without any transparency. Smell is of a strong cinnamon with a sweetness to it. Upfront taste is cinnamon with an aftertaste of slight Apple mixed in. The smell makes it seem as if it'd be overpowering but it is balanced nicely. Not normally my type of beer but definitely enjoyable.","ctjoumas","Dec 11, 2014"
