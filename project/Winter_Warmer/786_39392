3.56,-0.3,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Color is much darker than I expected.  Smell is pretty faint but getting a bit of chocolate and maybe some dark fruits.  Taste is pretty sweet with caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, and spices but with a bit of roast in the finish.  Medium body.  Light to medium carbonation.  Overall not a bad take on the style, but not something I would necessarily seek out.","ksimons","Jan 01, 2015"

4.25,19,,,,,," This brew actually pours a pitch black in color with a thin tan head. Areas of spotty lacing is seen when sipped that ends up sliding back down the sides of the glass after a while. The aroma is of roasted malts like in a stout with some cocoa powder. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with a hint of dark fruit. Medium-bodied with low carbonation which is perfect for this type of brew. Very smooth and tasty brew for the colder months","BeerWithMike","Dec 05, 2014"
