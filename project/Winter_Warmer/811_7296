4.11,2,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Overall, this was definitely much better than I expected and it's become my favorite seasonal beer. Extremely drinkable with a much more subtle flavor than most over-spiced winter beers. Definitely try it at least once if it's available in your area.","scbeerman","Mar 07, 2015"

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Pours rich amber color with a nice tan colored head that subsides slowing with mild lacing remaining on the glass and slight clumping once head subsides. Aroma of malts, slight hops with vanilla and hints of inter spices of cloves and cinnamon.  Mouth is what is hoped for and expected with a winter warmer.  Initial hit on the palate of slight hops with a vanilla mid and a light malty finish.  Always one of my favorites during the winter.","Tuckieman","Feb 22, 2015"
