Dried fruit on the nose accompanies dark sugar and cake aromas.  Dark, rich cakey bread leads the palate with spice, figs and a suspicion of cherry sweetened with light molasses with an earthy hop presence in the background.","pat61","Feb 04, 2015"

The taste is bold with flavor you pick up on the grains and malts in this brew. This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing over powering in this brew. The aftertaste is nice with a burnt caramel taste. You don't notice the high ABV in this brew.  The mouthfeel is rich and filling. Christmas Ale is smooth but bold tasting brew.

Aromas of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, pine, floral, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, floral, pine, grass, and herbal earthiness. Light amount earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, floral, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt and hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice winter warmer style. Good balance and robustness of malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; and smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 01, 2013"

A very slight roasty smell; I could sense some of the caramel and chocolate the beer advertises that it has, but it seemed faint, at least to me. The flavor is sweet with a toffee-ish taste with malt and nutmeg flavors detected. Medium body with a good balance. Overall, a pretty good seasonal drink.","fitzy84","Dec 29, 2012"

3.11,-11.1,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Breckenridge's Christmas Ale pours mahogany brown, with a little bit of amber highlights making themselves known as I hold the beer up to light. About a finger and a half of cream colored foam tops the beer, and while head retention is somewhat average, there's plenty of lacing left around the glass. The nose is disappointingly muted. Some caramel and a general spice aroma are appreciable, but neither exactly leaps out of the glass. The flavor profile is similarly dull. There's some caramel sweetness up front, and after seeing the beer's description on Breckenridge's mention chocolate I was able to pick up on a little bit (though maybe just because I was looking for it). There's a moderate bitterness present mid palate, and the finish is light holiday spices. I'm not quite sure if it's ginger or nutmeg, maybe a blend of the two. The body could stand to be a little bit more substantial, but the carbonation has a nice little kick to it.

Aroma was of sour fruit, with a bit of alcohol if you got up close. A very small touch of sweetness. Taste was sweet to finish, but started off with very mild and well balanced. A hint of spice, but also traces of a chocolate. Interesting, but very mellow flavors. A bit under stated. Intensified the longer it sat. Felt good in the mouth, coated well with the right amount of carbonation. Not a bad winter warmer, just a bit more subtle than I normally expect.","mountdew1","Mar 09, 2012"

3.4,-2.9,4,4,3,4,3,"Breckenridge Christmas Ale is a very clear and sparkling ruby ale with a sand colored head that fades to a bubbly film and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. It has sort of a sweet malty aroma of caramel and chocolate. The hops seem a little spicy and there may be orange peel in there. It's pretty light bodied and smooth. The finish is quick, clean and dry. It doesn't taste sweet like it smells. It's almost a little salty. DMS is detected, along with a note of cherry or plum. It's reasonably bitter. The bitterness lingers for a while after the finish, along with a peppery rumble and maybe phenol. It tastes ok, but it's not very focused. It goes down pretty smooth, but it's a little strange tasting. Maybe I shouldn't be drinking Christmas ale in January.","yesyouam","Jan 17, 2012"

4.6,31.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Breckenridge Christmas Ale pours a deep murky mahogany color with a cream colored head. A patch of bubbles and thin film are what remain after the head recedes. A nice sheet of light sticky lacing clings to the glass. The aroma is Christmas in a glass to me- a combination of pine, cedar, and orange peel immediately awaken my nose. Also, faint roasted malts linger in the background. The taste profile also starts out with an earthy, woody cinnamon-cedar note. Bright orange peel follows, mixed with some malt sweetness. The finish is piny hops, completing a well-rounded excursion into my favored Christmas Ale year after year. There is a notable tartness in the aftertaste. On a side note, I dig the artwork on the bottle, it has a weird Dickensonian feel about it to me.","JuicesFlowing","Dec 31, 2011"

I will give it a higher mark for the way it looks. However the aroma is pretty routine with mellow dark malts, a slight hop note, and little in the way of winter spicing. The body is in the medium range so it makes a slight comeback with that. The taste is an above average combination of barley malts and a moderately bitter quality that leaves a tingle at the end.","puboflyons","Dec 01, 2011"

The taste follows close suit to the nose. The taste is a little faint not as full as I had hoped for. There is a caramel malt backbone with a hint of sweetness to it. There is also touches of cinnomon and clove along with a very slight hop bite in the back end. The hope bite is balanced and not over the top. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and a little stingy.

Big thanks goes out to robwestcott for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Bottle #968 of 1400! 2008 Vintage Limited Special Edition! Served from a 33 oz. swing-top bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a deep reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, and slight peat. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, subtle peat, and very slight oxidation. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Had a pretty nice flavor here minus the slight oxidation I got on it. The aroma was quite nice too. Not sure if I would put this one in the Winter Warmer category if I'm honest but still a pretty good brew. Really glad I got a chance to try this one!","thagr81us","May 09, 2011"
3.68,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A more modest carbonation yields a small head here; the lacing does a good beery job of sticking though. Cookie dough, burnt sugar, plum pudding and toasted bread show not only its strength but the thickness of malt from the aroma. Creamy full body. Full malt jacket here--this beer is not kidding around. Brown bread, brown sugar, toasted marshmallows and a toasted husk flavor abound. Warmth kicks in mid-pint and stays mellow. Hops are certainly big enough to at least stand up to the sizable maltiness. The bitterness does not try to crush the malt, but rather tames it. Sweet, roasty and slightly hoppy finish.","BeerAdvocate","Mar 04, 2011"

There is a taste of alcohol towards the end, the 7.4 is not muted well. Don't get any hops and this is not reminding me of christmas. It's pretty much a very malty brown ale IMO.

Another winter spice ale, this one a bit less spice-forward than most, letting some left coast hops contribute the citrus note, and the dominant spice out a fairly well muted bunch was the cloves, not the usual cinnamon. Not a brew to rave about, but I wouldn't pass it up a few pints if it was served at someone's holiday party, either.

3.3,-5.7,3,3,3,4,4,"Overall: For a Christmas Ale this beer is mild by most measures, as most brewers tend to push the cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg levels to unimagined heights, as if Christmas could be made more Christmassy through the boiling and tincturing of its traditional aromatics. Not so with Breckenridge. It's definitely a Christmas Ale, my first comment after my initial sip was that it was an out-of-season experience. However, once you settle into the pint, the mild spiciness that is so evident at first, quiets and leaves behind a perfectly quaffable ale. It isn't sickly sweet, although it is sweet. The medium body and carbonation present a drinking experience that isn't as syrupy as the beer actually is.If my experience doesn't match other reviewers, blame the six months in the back of a liquor store.","CSAsylum","Jun 26, 2010"

Wait is this a porter? Mouthfeel is on the watery side, so I'm guessing the body is thinned out with some adjuncts. Not a bad thing necessarily, and I can't taste them anyway unless they burned them first. I mean roasted them, yes it has a strong roasted malt character through and through.

The hops were noticeably bright and floral, while the malt was toasty and sweet. There was a rich smoky backbone, and a lingering buttery aftertaste.

The taste initially malty, moderate caramel, slightly nutty, a little toasted, and moderately sweet. Toward the swallow a moderate hop flavor emerges, very nice. The bitterness is medium-low, but that combined with medium-low roasty flavor, there is enough to provide a nice balance. The carbonation is moderate and body/mouthfeel is medium with a good drinkability. Overall this is a well done Christmas style ale. A nice looking beer, the nose and flavor are both solid, with some complexity, and the subtle, but noticeable hop flavor is well done.

Smooth medium-bodied mouthfeel. Flavors of caramel and chocolate malt are apparent upfront. Piney hop bitterness arrives midway and carries into the finish. Obviously, the 7.4% abv supports why it's listed as an American Style Strong Ale on Breckenridge's website, but the taste reminds me of a hearty amber in my opinion. I think some of that can be contributed to the addition of the black patent malt that's utilized also. It definitely adds a nice depth of flavor to the finish. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

Clover honey and molasses nose, with some background dark crystal malt, english hop aromas and faint ginger/cinnamon notes. Roasted and caramel flavors upfront, followed by a touch of honey and a rich blackstrap taste. Aftertaste is dry and full of fuggle hop flavor with a solid piney hop bitterness. More hoppy than the aroma suggests, but retains a good balance. Sweet, medium to full body deposits plenty of residual sugar, but the fine carbonation and abundant hop charcter keeps the mouthfeel more dry and airy than cloying. Hint of ginger/cinnamon near the end, and finishes with a mild slickness that fades quickly due to assertive hops and drying spices.

This beer starts with a strong malt base that takes on caramel, toffee, bready, toasty flavors and a nearly-syrup body. Hopped for nice balance, while contributing a bit of citrus, earty, and pine flavors. Spices decorate the nose and flavors really subtally, but never contribute harshness in the feel. Seems well aged and matured, with only a hint of hotter alcohols or abrasion. Still has nice head retention and lacing with the last sip.

Odd, yet sweet, almost like the samples at a dept. store. Really sparked my interest. The ale like bittneress and foaming feeling was good, and swallowed with a thinner taste with an aftertaste that was of malt and alcohol. Tasting this and putting it in a winter warmer category, it did not seem right. There are so many beers out of Colorado, and if you're not Coors, you're making good stuff. Taste was, well, malts, lots of them with a sweet flavor vaguely like licorace with hops that took backstage but made this a well balanced beer. For being so powerful, I would easily be lured into having a few, and being hammered for it.","Ricochet","Feb 19, 2006"

Bizarre in that unpredicatable winter warmer way. The mouthfeel is medium or there abouts. Somewhat slick and syrupy. Drinkability is troubling.

It's Breckenridge's stout with a few extra ingredients to make it look like a Christmas ale. Mouthfeel is thin and consistency is almost like water. That's good and bad.

The malt body is toasted with dark caramel flavors everywhere. The overall flavor is more sweet than rich. A mild herbal hop flavor bounds about throughout a sip.

The nose is inviting, and quite interesting, with interwoven notes of caramel-drizzled and biscuity/bready malt, dark dried fruits (prunes and raisins), and pine. The flavor follows suit, and it's a fairly rich and somewhat complex brew with a beautiful, biscuity and toffee-ish malt component that's accented by yeasty fruitiness and a dollop of rounding buttery diacetyl. It's reminiscent of the Fuller's yeast character; and it's very English indeed! As it warms, the hops become more apparent... leafy, grassy, and slightly mineral-like; leaving it to finish with some lingering buttery toffee and drying, leafy and resinous hops.

Lightly earthy Fuggles hop nose and fruity esters lend an overall "British" aroma profile. Rich, dark caramel coupled with biscuit malt lends an toffeeish sweetness initally in flavor, then mellow diacetyl surfaces and provides richness. Although the hop bitterness is mild, a pleasantly dry, nutty, cracker like maltiness assists in offsetting the malt sweetness. Moderately bodied, and smooth in mouthfeel, due to both ample residual dextrins and low relative carbonation. Perhaps a touch oily. The earthy hop flavor mirrors that of the aroma, but is present at a lower level. Finishes sweet, w/ hints of burnt malt. Rustic breadiness coats the palate with an exhale. Breckenrige Xmas is a well above average and tasty winter brew. A bit high in diacetyl, but that seems to complement the dark caramel character.
