The chocolate and roasted malt is more predominant in the taste, along with toffee, raisins and  dark cherries. Medium mouth with some carbonation. Not much spice for a winter warmer, but it's a very nice beer, somewhere between a strong ale and a porter.","MartzMimic","Feb 15, 2015"

4.38,12.9,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Stir Crazy pours a dark brown color with a small lacing head.  There is a sweet aroma with hints of vanilla, brown sugar and raisins.  The taste has big and heavy, lots of vanilla, sweet fruit, with hints of chocolate.  Nice big body and feel.  Overall its a fantastic beer, and a top winter warmer.","vette2006c5r","Dec 29, 2014"
