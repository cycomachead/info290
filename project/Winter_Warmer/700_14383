3.84,4.3,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,"12oz bottle in pint glass.  Golden orange color, slightly hazy, very little head and only minor lacing; slight carbonation; earthy/pine scent; a sweet undertone to the flavor-- caramel-like in its finish.  Overall: An interesting take on a winter/Christmas ale insofar as it doesn't appear to have any distinct spice flavor and is not particularly memorable. I'd try it again on tap but not likely to buy another sixer. (8.0)","GFM","Jan 02, 2015"
