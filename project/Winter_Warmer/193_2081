I would buy this again, but definitely for the winter while its cold and not during the warm spring as it is now.","kitch","Mar 27, 2015"

Flavors begin with malt-forward sweetness, esters, toffee and caramel, are supported by a mild hop bitterness, and finishes with spice and lingering sweetness. Full bodied, creamy, thick texture, soft carbonation, and a little booziness on the finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 14, 2015"

Beer poured with a very dark brown-amber and cloudy appearance with a thick head that dissipated quickly with thin lacing on the sides. Powerful noise of vanilla, cinnamon, and a buttery caramel flavor. The taste had more of a bitter citrus flavor than I could smell mixed with some bready malts. The mouthfeel was creamy, which definitely made this a very relaxing, almost dessert-like drink for the evening. Definitely a great winter warmer.","fitzy84","Feb 08, 2014"

I guess, now looking at other reviews, it can also come off as vanilla and caramel as well, which is basically the taste of candy corn, if I remember it correctly. Hops aren't really noticeable in the smell or taste per se, but this beer is not overly sweet. The feel has a nice, full-body, and a moderate carbonation. A very pleasant sipper, and a beer that I really enjoyed. I haven't had many winter warmers, but if they tend to be like this one, color me impressed. I'd very gladly have another.

Spice on the nose provides hints of orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and citrus. Rich malt flavors and a touch of vanilla lead into flavors that include orange, amaretto, caramel, nutmeg, and spices. The citrus hops help balance out the sweetness and mellow the spices to not overpower the palate. Medium-light mouthfeel, Winter Solstice is moderately carbonated.

This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these but after that the thickness might become too much. What I liked the most about this beer was how well rounded it was, it really didn't have any weak points. What I liked the least about this beer was that the spices didn't shine through a little more, I think that would take this beer to the next level. I would buy some more when it's released next year, but I don't think I'll be rushing to the store and clearing them out of Winter Solstice, but I do recommend giving this beer a try, I think it would appeal to a wide range of people. All in all I thought this was a nice beer, It's not my favorite Winter Warmer but it was still a nice beer that enjoyed drinking.

Smell is of malt, caramel, fruits, and some slight funky aromas. I think there may be an issue with this beer based on the smell. Taste is much the same with a mild spice finish and a slightly funky flavor that isn't as bad as the smell would indicate. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer as it stands with what seems like a mild infection issue. Even though the funk doesn't come through as much in the taste vs. smell, there is definitely a problem with the can I picked up.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 19, 2012"

The light sprinkling of brown sugar doesn't really appear until after the glass has been allowed to warm up somewhat. Spicing is somewhat light and muted, but what is there comes across as a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium body and lightly carbonated.

Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, biscuit, and spices on the finish for a bit. Nice and enjoyable balance of flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel.

Color was a reddish-orangish amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was a riot of biscuit malt, orange citrus, vanilla, toffee and pine needles. Wow! Mouthfeel was medium and my original review mentioned a taste of Orange Dreamsicle and I have to say, I do not disagree in this iteration. It really had an orange-vanilla flavor up front with the pine coming through on the finish. It was semi-dry which was a nice change of pace after a day of APAs and IPAs. I just realized that it was kind of stupid of me to have opened this today - the Solstice is this Thursday! Perhaps I CAN score another between now and then ... Man, for 6.9, it drank beautifully, but CANversely, I would not want a whole bunch of this beer, either. Finally, I should mention the dense lacing that appeared throughout.

I get a subtle allspice as well. Very pleasant. The flavor offers more of the same which suits me just fine. It has an unusual finish that suggests a woodsy berry, perhaps what others have referred to as cranberry, but it's not all that tart to me. I get more of a pear and evergreen blend with what seems to be a slightly herbal hop. This is smooth and fully carbonated with very tiny bubbles that provide a lively, but slightly resinous feel without masking the flavor. It's solidly a medium body brew and provides a very tasty refreshment that fits in with the winter/holiday theme. I really enjoyed this.","Durge","Dec 17, 2011"

3.83,-1.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Little over a finger’s worth of eggshell white to brown foam, fairly dense with decent retention, the few larger bubbles scattered, not much lacing, more of a thin sheet which slides effortlessly down the glass sides. Filmy liquid, lots of aggressive bubbles floating throughout, orange base with brown mixed in, more yellow around the edges, captures light to create a healthy glow. There’s vanilla, clove and caramel in the nose but a lot of the time the peat moss, grains and wet iron notes rise above, light smattering of peach to apricot fruit scents, more textural fullness than aromatics. Full-bodied, sufficient carbonation to create a slow lift, not leaden. Not especially sweet but there’s date, clove, fruitcake to caramel elements, some orange peel and peach, pear too. More scone or biscuit than bread or dough, Not as herbaceous here as in the nose yet the earthy, metallic nuance persists. Root beer and vanilla appear as it warms. Rich finish, no loss of body, maybe contributes to a general sense of booziness albeit without any burn. Strikes you as a food beer, needs accompaniment. Not something you’d want more than a couple of in a single sitting.","farrago","Dec 17, 2011"

It has the deep, bready tones of a doppelbock, but the fruitiness of some kind of strong ale. There are flavors of prune and wood resin and an aftertaste of dried fruit.

The service head dissappears rather quickly, and no aparent carbonation to maintain it. Delicious nose of paprika, cloves, eggnog and cinnamon. Love the spice arrangement in this one. Has a real sense of togetherness, harmony in it's design. Starts off a little bit off. Cranberry and cherries mix with strong cloves, cinnamon and what tastes like carrots. Lasts a long time, extends in spice and what I can only refer to as turkey stuffing. Definite pommegrenate bitterness in the finish. Belgian feel and christmas spice, with tart acidity in the end giving it character. Low alcoholic feel, and a tad cloying spice as it extends a little too long. Nice, warm feeling christmas beer. Not too heavy for a spiced beer, yet thick enough to go with these strong spiced christmas dishes.","iguenard","May 07, 2011"

Vanilla is evident throughout with some caramel and quite a bit of malt. Finish has a short sweetness fading to a lingering spiciness and hoppiness.

As yummy as this is, nearly all classic beer characteristics are absent here. No hop bitterness and the sugary sweetness instead of malty sweetness. It has a definite cider-like quality. Lots of apple on the finish with a touch of roasted malt to give it some coffee-like notes. It doesn't go down too heavy but I still don't think I could drink very much of this.

The aroma is fruity with a definite tartness. I smell some cherry and an apple/pear note with a hint of a dry citrus. There's something faint that a can't put my finger on that brings to mind a glass of Chardonnay. I'm going to just attribute that to the combo of apple and pears. The flavor is tart cherry up front and borders on a hard candy cherry flavor, like a Jolly Rancher. There's a bit of malt body there too though it's distant which gives the finish a chocolate covered cherry quality. I still get apples but not as much pear as on the nose. To be precise, there's a distinct apple peel flavor to me which I didn't find appealing. It seems a bit astringent almost like crab apple. I have to say that the finish average overall. I don't find myself wanting to drink more. I would like a bit more malt and some spice to balance out the fruit. I'd be happier if I tasted cooked, spiced apples rather than dry apple peels. Overall not bad but definitely not great. It smelled nice, but I suppose I was expecting a bit more than fruit to show up when I tasted it. Disappointing.

Even though this offering is an ale, there is the impression of a creaminess that works its way across the palate during the offering thanks in part to the warming vanilla highlights accentuated in the offering. The mild carbonation in this offering is not a fault of the beer as it allows the beer to sort of be forced across the mouth rather than have the carbonation do all the heavy lifting.

I'm trying to figure out what people like about it, but there's enormous sweet note in the finish that's turning my stomach. It reminds me of Shiner's terrible Holiday Cheer - there's almost a peach/apricot note in the sweetness. It tastes like there's an ok winter warmer underneath the bizarre sweet fruit notes, but it's a stretch for me to say anything positive here. More than anything, it tastes like a terrible flavored cola, Vanilla Coke or something. Actually, I think that the terrible flavor might be more vanilla than fruit. Either way, it's not to my liking.

Very heavy aroma of fruit (apple/cherry) and spice(cinnamon) with lesser hints of molasses and some light malt. Strong alcohol flavor hits first followed by a very nice fruitiness with lots of cinnamon and some lesser vanilla and a slight bourbon flavor. Slight sediment in the bottom and the beer has very large, medium speed carbonation. Good beer but it definitely feels like more alcohol is present than the 6.9% listed on the bottle.","Narnad","Aug 01, 2009"
3.73,-3.9,3.5,3,4,4,4,"This beer pours a hazy brownish-amber color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is tons of caramel, toffee, and even a hint of peat. This smells very much like a Wee Heavy. It is nice, but rather simple. The taste is quite different than the aroma. There is still a lot of caramel, but there is more toffee and the peat is gone. It has a nice malty complexity, and is interesting. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately low carbonation and a sugary texture. Overall, this is a nice beer. It would be a lot more enjoyable if the aroma was lively, but it is still alright. I could drink this again.","KarlHungus","Jul 11, 2009"

Medium-bodied and creamy, this beer is also smooth and sweet with a chocolate and coffee malt taste bursting when it hit my tongue, and complemented by roasted, maybe toasted, some caramel and toffee malts. It passes excellently over the tongue and finishes with a dry, hoppy backbite that is mellow and complements the malts (also a little spicy but not prickly). Warms the mouth like a winter warmer does w/o having to use alkie burn as a method (at 6.9% they really hit the nail on the head with this one).

The body is a murky but translucent brown with amber highlights. The nose is warm and toasty, with notes of brown sugar, cream, butter, bread, and vanilla. The taste is almost unique to me, with the only similar beer in my experience being AV's other beer Summer Solstice. It has a sweet, grainy, almost dessert-like character to it. At a loss of words to describe the flavor, I saw another reviewer describe it as "chocolate cake." I would agree with this to a certain extent, but also add in vanilla, caramel, and other flavors that defy description. The mouth is just right in terms of heaviness, but I think a little less carbonation would make this more enjoyable. Still, ever since I first had this on draft at McGrath's in Harrisburg, PA, I've been a fan, and I can say that this is one of the best tasting beers I've ever had.","mjc410","Jan 30, 2007"

4.97,28.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Anderson Valley Brewing Co. makes some pretty good beers, but during the real cold months, the Winter Solstice comes out to play. Pouring a lightish amber hue, the quickly fading off-white head trails down the snifter. The smells of sweet malt, faint holiday spice, and orange brandy hit your nose like a sweet winter warming train. The creamy mouth feel of the beer stays consistent from start to finish. Tastes of delicate holiday spices paired with subtle hints of orange essence that trail off into a creamsicle (50/50 bar) like finish. The aftertaste lingers on wonderfully until the next sip. This is, by the way, a medium to heavy bodied sipping beer, that should be served in a snifter for maximum drinking pleasure. I always like to pair food with the beers I review, but not this time. Given that the beer stands so well on it's own, and only comes out in winter, I like this one all by itself....but if you must indulge, a little pound cake would pair perfectly...Enjoy","Greenfloyd","Jan 20, 2007"

A full off-white head of medium duration, comprised of small, tight bubbles allows some respectable lace to prsent itself. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy, and body is medium-full. Toffee and light candy flavors dominate, sweet yet tangy, but with a rather dry finish and only a residual hop bitterness. I was once told that this is brewed using Belgian Candy Sugar (and the label reads "ale brewed with natural flavor") so who knows? The website doesn't give away any secrets, either. Nor does the beer provide any evidence of its ample strength; the 6.8% here drinks so easily and smoothly that you'll swear it's an ordinary beer, but it's not.

Cheerfully light-to-medium body, just a tad slippery but overall smooth mouthfeel. This is an eminently quaffable beer, any time of year.

4.33,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"My first review of any beer. I just tried this up against Anchor's Christmas Ale and found it to be more rounded and mature in both appearance and taste although less robust in general character (Anchor quite nice and I will review that soon). It's a fairly deep amber ale with a relatively small head (considering the thin pilsener style glass I'm using). The taste is balanced, pleasantly sweetly spicy with some room to further mature (but not nearly to the same extent as the Anchor), but drinkable now and in vast quantities if that is your aim. Its aroma matches its clean appearance with the sweet spice hint although I'm at a loss to precisely identify the constituents added to this fine beer. I'm not sure about the "mouthfeel" category in general as most quality beers seem silky to me and the Anderson Valley Winter Solstice 2006 is no different. My inclination is to only highlight mouthfeel when I notice something unusual one way or the other, and this beer has the "right" feel. Overall a particularly enjoyable beer that doesn't beat you over the head with hops like another seasonal ale I tried yesterday. The Winter Solstice is very, sweetly, good - I intend to buy a case!

It seems to have lost a bit of carbonation, but it's always been a smooth, delicately carbonated and malty beer. In the flavor, the maltiness seems to have dwindled a bit, but its orange-like citrus flavor remains along with some spicy hops. The bitterness has softened, and it's remarkably drinkable! You could easily quaff a pint or two of this before the strength of the alcohol snuck up on you. That's not to say that it's improved, however. This is a beer best enjoyed fresh!!!

The mouth is fairly flat and pretty light. The opening is dominated by malt and vanilla, followed by subdued hops.

A moderate, caramelized sugar and butter impression hits the palate at first, then yields to mild notes of cream and carob. Bready sweetness persists nearly unhindered until partially offset by lately emerging moderate hop and well baked biscuity bitterness. Light but bright strawberry like fruitiness. Mellow spice impressions of sweetish allspice and vanilla bean add depth of character. Unwavering, pervasive medium caramel sweetness is marginally contrasted by mild, non descript, functional hop bitterness. A touch lightly bodied, with an abrupt, slick mouthfeel. Finishes with hints of burnt biscuit, cream and brown sugar. Quite a tasty brew, but with an odd afterthought impression of bourbon spiked vanilla Coke.

I started in on taking a couple small whiffs, and then I inhaled it all. This beer contained a niced mild hop character, yet I could smell some nutmeg and other seasonal spices flowing in the air, all complemented with an amazing aroma of maple syrup. At the first taste an awesome malty sweetness arose to my palate, along with the balancing of the hops. I thought the maple syrup flavor was the most noticeable extra curricular flavoring that stood out to me, and it defintely formed an awesome winter seasonal beer that is in my top five for it's category.

3.9,0.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours with a nice frothy head that lasts a long time. A deep, reddish amber hue with little carbonation. Smell is very mellow, malty. Taste is mostly malty with very subdued hops, fairly well balanced, but very sweet. The sweetness limits the drinkability imho, I could only drink one of these at a time. I thin a little more hoppiness would balance it a bit more and give it more character. Without the hoppiness to balance the malt, I found it a bit one dimensional. A nice beer, but there's better winter beers to be had.","LarryV","Dec 01, 2002"
3.6,-7.2,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,2.5,"2002 edition. Medium dark brownish amber with a cream colored head that shrinks to just a cap. Hefty malt aroma, very sweet smelling...like marshmallows. The taste is all malt and pretty sweet but there is a good deal of complexity within those confines. Flavors of milk chocolate, cloves, malted milk balls, and vanilla. I feel that a bit more hops would have made this a better brew. I like it but it's a bit too sweet and definitely not a brew I'd want more than one of at a time. Save it for after dinner.","johnrobe","Nov 29, 2002"
3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"My overall impression of this beer is one of unimpression. Poured out a reddish orange and brown with a decent head. Sweet malt on the nose, like cotton candy. Kind of reminded me of the dried malt extract I use in homebrewing. The taste was primarily of carmel like sweet malt which was a bit cloying IMO. There is a tinge of hop bitterness as the malt fades. Besides the intense malt flavor this beer is somewhat thin. Mouthfeel plays a redemptive role with a creamy smoothness. Slight aftertaste. Not the best of the seasonals and a disappointment for me. Maybe I just wasn't into it, but I expect better things from Anderson Valley.","DrewS","Nov 25, 2002"
3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"For a fairly high abv strong ale style, this beer keeps on the kid gloves. The aroma and flavor are both quite soft. Malt with a little milk chocolate in the nose. The flavor is a cottony sweet malt - a touch of caramel and hazelnut. Finish is very clean. I'm probably rating this beer a little low just because I expect a strong ale to have a little more clout in the flavor department. As a fireside sipper, this needed more horsepower.","Brent","Nov 24, 2002"
3.18,-18,4,3.5,3,3,3,"This deep amber beer with orange-red highlights pours with an attractive white head the displays decent retention. The aromas are a little of spice and a little of hops, pleasant but not assertive enough to pick out individual traits. The taste was like a normal pale ale that had some spice added to it somewhere along the line. The beer displayed a normal light ale feel on the tongue, but left an unpleasant bitterness clinging to my mouth on the finish. The poor finishing characteristics and the high ABV result in a beer I'm glad I tried, but of which I didn't buy a sixer. My third offering from Anderson Valley was definitely not a "charm".","aaronh","Nov 23, 2002"

3.98,2.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Clear and bright dark red-brown color, yellow head of medium duration -- settles to an 1/8 of an inch.  Deep aroma, some ginger and cinnamon sense.  Nice body but not overly heavy.  Flavor starts malty with some sense of cherry and chewiness and flips into a citrus rind and gravelly mode as the impressive hopping asserts itself.  Good balance, maybe a little too raw in that the hops are aggressive.  A little more variety and interest in the malt profile would have suited me better.","ADR","Oct 27, 2002"
3.91,0.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice presentation, dark cararmel/copper in color, somewhat of a light fruit taste appears with a slight hop finish.  I enjoyed this.  Nice ABV kick start and although I don't like to use an overused term, it is smooth.  There is something soothing and relaxing about a sipping a winter ale, and this one didn't disappoint.","proc","Oct 03, 2002"
4.42,13.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"my favorite from anderson valley....a dark reddish brown with a nice fluffy white head.  aroma is enticingly spicy....carmel malts dominate the taste, with a hint of nutmeg.  hops come in at the end to balance assertively, without being over the top as so many PNW beers can be.  a truly unique brew that is at the top of my winter seasonals must have list.","pheurton","Jul 29, 2002"
4.32,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I carried this bottle back from my california vacation, I was worried about it's freshness. It seems to have held up. Color I would call more brown than amber, thin head faded fast. Noticable hop smell initially, then as it warms, more spices are very noticable. Faint nutmeg, cinnamon, make a distinct sweet smell. Taste is much the same, hops to start, then lots of unique spices, maybe vanilla, hazelnut, very sublte, though not overly spicy. Very balanced taste and feel. A little thinner on the feel than expected but I found it very drinkable and tasty. I was surprised to see it listed where it is, and not with other seasonals like the Harpoon Winter Warmer, or the SA Celebration Ale, which is the best of the seasonals, IMO.","StevieW","Jun 15, 2002"

Very good beer, with a nice warming alcohol character. This is a very good winter brew and I'll look for it closer to the season next time, although this one held up very well.","jackndan","May 11, 2002"
