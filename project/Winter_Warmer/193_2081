3.77,-2.8,4,3.25,4,3.5,4,"O: This one surprised me in a good way. Although the aroma was a bit weak, the taste was nice as the vanilla, toffee and caramel tastes mixed well together. I would buy this again, but definitely for the winter while its cold and not during the warm spring as it is now.","kitch","Mar 22, 2015"

It tastes metallic and odd to me - but enough of the positives.  Note to self.  Don't order this, and get new friends","BradMacMullin","Feb 15, 2015"
3.48,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Not a bad spiced ale. Vanilla, cinnamon, yet still a malty sweetness. Not really a winter warmer, no burn. Good seasonal ale.","KevChiTown","Feb 14, 2015"

3.92,1,3,3.5,4,5,4,"Bottle poured into pint glass. Golden-red clear liquid with tall, fluffy tan head that leaves sticky sheets on the glass. Aroma is caramel malt, vanilla, winter spice, citrus, and fruity esters. Flavors begin with malt-forward sweetness, esters, toffee and caramel, are supported by a mild hop bitterness, and finishes with spice and lingering sweetness. Full bodied, creamy, thick texture, soft carbonation, and a little booziness on the finish.","SierraFlight",
