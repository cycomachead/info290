3.28,-13.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall, this is an aggressively spicy, flavorful brew that could only be appropriate for the season.  I’m not especially keen on allspice to begin with, and in this case it’s far from balanced.  I had this on tap a couple months ago and recall a much mellower brew, so I’m not sure which experience is more representative of the brewers’ intention.","MaximalC","Feb 05, 2015"
