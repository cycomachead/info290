I’m not especially keen on allspice to begin with, and in this case it’s far from balanced.  I had this on tap a couple months ago and recall a much mellower brew, so I’m not sure which experience is more representative of the brewers’ intention.","MaximalC","Feb 08, 2015"

Once in the chilled imperial pint glass its medium body is almost opeque,  you can only see light through the edges of the glass.  The spices really come out in the aroma.   Cinnamon,  nutmeg,  and allspice mix in with molasses making me think of sitting in front of a fireplace with a cigar in my favorite holiday sweater during a week long blizzard.   The spices stand out from the first gulp.   Nutmeg is almost overpowering but the other spices come through and combine richly with the molasses in the end.   The beer does have a bit of a medicinal or alcoholic taste but overall it balances nicely and isn't a real hard drink. Overall I would recommend buying it in singles but a definite must try.","daddycard","Dec 06, 2014"

The mouthfeel didn't flatten out all that much. In my opinion, to do this beer justice, it has to be served a bit warmer than the typical beer... It's a different story.

Felt good in the mouth, nicely coated, a bit of stick, not much carbonation. Overall a good example of a winter warmer without being too heavily spiced.","mountdew1","0"

What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, neither the malts or the spices were too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I really disliked about it and I can't think of anything I would change to make it better. I would buy this again and I would like to keep some around for the holidays. I would recommend this to anybody who generally likes Winter Warmers. All in All I was happy with this beer and I'm glad it wasn't over spiced.

Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, dark bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, roasted malt, chocolate, toast, prune, earth, and light herbal spiciness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, dark bread, brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, roasted malt, chocolate, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of robust flavors; with a nice malt backbone over the spices; and almost zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

Pours roasty brown with a thin off-white head that recedes quite quickly. Aromas of nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and some orange. Bit disappointed with the taste as it did not mirror the delicious aromatics as initially indicated. Flavors of dark fruit, indistinct spices- perhaps some nutmeg? Somewhat bittery back finish. As mysterious as the flavor is, I am at loss of how well hidden the high alochol is! Medium-bodied with nice carbonation throughout. As the beer warmed up a bit, the more I found myself to enjoy this one. I would gladly have this one again on a cold winter night.","CuriousMonk","Jan 15, 2012"

Gingerbread, dried cherries, toffee, cocoa, raisin. It starts strong but the finish is lackluster. Carbonation is pretty high and the body leaves me wanting more heft.

Alot of sweetness with the candycanes and caramel, no toffee. Some minimal chocolate. Feel is medium and coating, spicy and sweet at the same time, a hint of alcohol.

The nose was a real treat w/ the aromas of chai tea, vanilla, ginger, clove, and nutmeg. The taste was pretty much on par as expected w/ a finish of mild bittering hops. For 11% ABV this brew was surprisingly drinkable due to the herbs/spices masking well. The mouthfeel was a little thin for my taste - wanted this to be slightly creamier. Overall, this brew was very unique, interesting, and enjoyable. Glad I got the chance to sample, but don't think I will be seeking this one out again, due to it reminding me more of tea than beer.

Chocolate malts, egg nog, and a good amount of nuttiness as well. Very pleasant aroma, nothing overdone or in your face. Taste is very similar to the aroma with a bit more spice. Nutmeg, ginger, and some pumpkin up front. Midway the rich malts emerge and lead to the spicy aftertaste. Once again, the flavors are in check, with nothing over the top crazy. Medium to full body with a rich feel and a prickly carbonation. There is a touch of alcohol, but it doesn't take away from the beer. By far one of the better Winter Warmers out there.

3.85,1.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I'm not completely sure about the style of this beer, so if somebody else knows better than correct it for me. I do know that this beer was spiced up bigtime! It was also very dark and very thick. The initial taste was of a thick burnt malt flavor. That was followed by some spices mainly ginger with a few others. A slight floral hop flavor came but went very quickly because more spices came along the lines of nutmeg and (cardamon?). I don't know what exactly all the spices were but I do know that they worked well in this beer. I couldn't have too many of these though because they were very filling.","granger10","0"
