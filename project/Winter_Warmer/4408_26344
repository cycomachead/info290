3.64,0.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"A holiday nose that features  health spicing makes me draw back and admire the amber color and lovely head on this one. Nose showcases the spices while allowing a solid malt bill to underpin and hold court. Taste is an enjoyable pale ale holiday. Feel and flavor give a winter weightiness. Nice. An above averages take on the style that lends itself to session style rounds of drinking.","scootny","Dec 15, 2014"
