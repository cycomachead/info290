The nose comprises perfume-y caramel, light greens, light raisin, a pinch of cinnamon, and the vague inference of dark fruits way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices and fruits (now not quite as dark, but not quite un-dark to not be called dark anymore) increased a notch or two throughout. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a nice spicy Winter warmer, something I wouldn't mind enjoying time to time during these cold months.","TMoney2591","Feb 10, 2013"

Aroma of moderately toasted malt, mild dark fruit, cinnamon and holiday spicing. Taste is dark dried fruit, toasted and bready malt, cinnamon and spices, rather mild tasting. Medium bodied. Nice flavor and well integrated, but very mild and low-key flavoring overall. Pleasant to drink, but kind of characterless (unlike Ebenzer from Dickens).","LiquidAmber","Jan 12, 2013"

3.36,-7.7,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Conclusion: I was afraid of this. Bridgeport makes appealing looking beers, but it seems that they often fall short with the execution. So many craft brewers (big and small) these days are making really fine beer, so to produce mediocre beer just doesn't cut it. Bridgeport loves to tout their position as the oldest craft brewer in Oregon, but it seems that they haven't updated their beer to compete with the ever more and more refined and perfected craft industry. For example, this beer can't stand up to other winter beers like Jubel, Hibernation, or even the mild mannered Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome. This isn't bad beer by any means, but there are just too many better options to ever buy (or drink) it again in this price segment.","allforbetterbeer","0"
3.97,9.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, not a bad beer but not as good as many others of the style. This frankly felt like more of a dark almost-an-IPA than a winter warmer too me. I think this beer would have been improved with more spices and a little bit less hops.","jmbranum","Dec 12, 2012"

A pleasant mix of earthy hops and caramel malts together with a biscuit bread tone in the nose. The beer is more balanced than the nose lets on with a earthy pine hop and mild bitterness, a hint of caramel malt sweetness, a spicy note as well. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Finishes dry with a lingering caramel malt flavor. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. A little late in the for a winter warmer but it was nice.","hopfacebrew","Mar 03, 2012"

The aftertaste is a bit chewy and the bitterness lingers, but these qualities are balanced by a good sharp bite.

It's just that, well, sometimes hops just aren't called for. This brew has some nice and complex fruitcake, cherry, and cinnamon notes going for it, but the hops come in and decimate any delicate wintery flavors that I noticed in the nose. I love having my palate destroyed with hop power, but not when I'm trying to concentrate on the wonderful, but more delicate notes that can't stand up to the almighty hop. All in all, this is a fine brew... i just think it could have been slightly better. A near miss of top tier beer IMO","pmcadamis","Dec 31, 2008"

Head was a pale tan color with minimal lacing. Welcoming aroma with spice and caramel notes. The flavors matches the aroma very well, with a smooth caramel flavor on the back of the tongue. Body was thinner than usual for the style. Very smooth and drinkable, a 4-5 pint session would happen before you realized it.

Nothing too complex, but in this case, the simplicity works out well. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a medium thickness.

Transitions quickly into a pleasantly lingering aftertaste that is bitter and eventually a little spicy. Medium to full bodied with a good creamy texture and a softish carbonation that makes this very drinkable. I consistenly buy at least a sixer of this every holiday season, partially because the local grocer always carries it.

If it wasn't 85 degrees outside I would have been in total bliss, but had to settle for beer enjoyment.

Taste is much of the same, both hoppy and malty, with a bit of a strong alcohol taste, despite the fact that it is only 6%. A bit sweet perhaps, not especially easy to drink. This beer is interesting, it isn't quite as heavy or strong as most winter warmers, but doesn't really fit the bill of a casual drinker as an IPA or APA.

Hops are apparent but never dominant although they do seem to play more of a role as the beer warms. This seems like a less potent (in taste not alcohol terms), more subtle take on Deschutes Jubelale. It is well balanced and very pleasant.","charlatan","Dec 11, 2005"

The flavor and mouthfeel explode together as rich caramel and chocolate flavors intermingle with herbal and fruity hop tastes. The finish is moderately long, but the feel is very carbonated (but not overly so) and creamy.

There is not much to the aroma. I think the only thing I can put a name to is a slight grape like aroma. I can not detect any hop presence. It has a nice toasted malt taste. I can taste grapes slightly. As with the arome, I taste no hops at all. It has a very slight cinnimon taste, but not much. This beer is sort of lacking on flavor and aroma. Perhaps some more hops and some spices would help. This beer goes down smooth. It is carbonated well. It leaves a sweet taste on my palate. This beer would make a good session beer because it is low in alcohol, and the flavor is very non aggressive. I doubt I will try this one again.","OStrungT","May 26, 2005"

This one didn't taste bad and would be a good warmer but I did feel like someone had taken a standard beer with some nice maltiness and thrown in a splash of wine.

Some vinous and cherry-like notes greet you in the nose, followed by a waft of chocolate and caramel. Overall, the aroma is somewhat restrained, but what's there is very nice. In the mouth it's medium-full bodied and creamy with a moderate, natural carbonation. The flavor, not unlike the aroma, is somewhat limited as well. The notes of cherry remain (they're not sweet, but still cherry-like), and the delicate cocoa flavor is there as well; but overall it's very restrained. Some alcohol is present but it's unobtrusive; and some leafy hops emerge in the dry finish. As a fan of English-style beers I can say that this makes a decent pint, but I'd imagine most American beer lovers will be left looking for more.","NeroFiddled","Jan 05, 2005"

The flavor is actually a little thin; very fleeting. There is a nice sweet malt, but it tastes like there are some spices in there that I'm not too keen on. I'm not really into the spiced beers all that much. The feel is moderate to thick, but something about it makes it seem thin. Overall, a ho-hum beer.

Malt flavor comes through with a few more hops than you would find in marzen or similar. No spices or other fruit flavors did I notice. This is the type of beer I wish I had been guzzling in my teenage years, rather than bud or Natty Ice. Type of beer you can drink all night, enjoy the taste of, but not feel too bad about missing the the intricacies of the flavor once you get smashed.","poundboy","0"

The taste was composed of sweet caramel, citrus, and hints of roasted coffee. It had a bit of oily mouthfeel with a good hop bite. The finish was dry, citrusy, slightly sweet, and noticably astringent. It was a good beer, but not an exciting one.

The spice carried over in the taste but not to strong while other flavors of caramel and raisin are balanced nice by an alcohol backed hop.

Lightly sweet in the front, there are notes and hints of chocolate, raisins, and other dark fruits. A bit over carbonated for a beer that should be served at cellar temperatures, though a quick swirling of my glass takes care of this deficiency. A smooth cream soda type of feel & taste to this beer. Evokes memories of vanilla. Curiously this bottle conditioned ale has the least amount of sediment (barely a faint ring at the bottom) I have ever seen in a bottle conditioned "real" ale.

Malts slowly assert themselves to be sweet, toffeeish and dominant. I'm not sure what, if any, spices were used here but there does seem to be an overwhelming herbalness. This may be solely from the hops. Over time, the malts stretch themselves out and really carry the beer. Mouthfeel is decidedly unsticky which is welcome for such a sweet, malty beer. I didn't particularly like it at first, but over the course of the pint it really sank its claws into me and at the end I wanted another. This may be due to its excellent aftertaste.","Thrasher","Nov 16, 2003"
