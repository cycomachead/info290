2.58,-26.1,3.5,3,2.5,2,2.25,"Overall - Going off the only info I could find regarding Wychwood's bottling date, apparently the A3EFG code corresponds to it having been been brewed sometime in 2013. Considering how muted and watery this beer is, I'd say that's probably likely, and I'd venture to guess somewhere around 15 months old; not good for a beer that's only 5% ABV. A shame I hadn't caught this before I bought it.","TheSixthRing","Jan 03, 2015"

3.74,7.2,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a reddish-dark amber in color with about a good half-finger off-white creamy head. Some light sheets of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts and spice. Bit more going on with the taste with some dark fruits, caramel, yeast and toffee in the mix as well. A slightly dry hoppy finish was noticed but didn't last too long at all. Winter Warmer style brews have been all over the board. Medium-bodied with good carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Dec 26, 2014"

Anyway, it's definitely a great looking beer with a pleasing scent of malts.  What I also enjoyed was the brew's smoothness - silkier than silk - and it helped mask the strong, almost too overpowering taste of the hops - a bit more bitter than I expected for an ale.  Overall, it a really good beer, and I really like getting the larger bottles - so friends, keep them coming.","jjamadorphd","Dec 20, 2014"
4.49,28.7,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4,"Overall: I figured that I'd save this one for Christmas Eve, so I did - my preferences are more towards the malt end of the spectrum but even so this one might be a tad overdone. That said, it is marketed as a winter ale and it hits the bullseye there. Good, but not amazingly so.","interzen","Dec 18, 2014"

3.37,-3.4,4,3.25,3.25,4,3.25,"500ml bottle $4.99. I used to love Hobgoblin so I thought this would be nice and festive. Dark amber color, good head. Aroma is sort of malt vinegar which I get from English beers sometime, not a sour vinegar. Flavor is malt, malt, malt and not bad but I wouldn't buy this again.","ArrogantB",
