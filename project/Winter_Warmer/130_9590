It pours brilliant burn amber to garnet under an off-white foam cap. The palate starts creamy and malty and then there a little tanginess arises followed by some smooth malt flavors that fade as it dries out in the finish and lingers with a mingling of malty and bitter after tastes with just a touch of pepper. A hint of heat, very faint roast, medium body and medium to a shade less on the carbonation.","pat61","Dec 03, 2014"
