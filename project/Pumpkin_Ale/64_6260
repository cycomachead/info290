This ale fits the bill though the 2014 version is not quite as good as prior vintages. The head and lace are lacking in the latest vintage and this effects the mouthfeel which seems dry.

3.49,-11.4,4.25,4,3,3.75,3.5,"Hmmm.... a full bodied "brown ale"... not so sure about that. Despite the misleading description, it has a remarkably pleasant appearance. It is jubilantly orange, with an inviting glow when it catches the light. In fact, the playful and vibrant orange color is the attribute I enjoyed the most about this beer. Not far behind is the aroma. The spices and pumpkin meat meld in to an alluring symphony. My wife declared that it is "mouth-watering". She's not even a big beer drinker. As for the taste....This is a little bit on the cloying side with an initial sugary sweetness, followed by a harsh spicing regimen that sticks to the palate and never quite meshes coherently. The phenolic clove characteristics seem to override the malt presence and compete with a boozy fusel alcohol that rides through the whole experience. The pumpkin flavor is struggling to come through, as are the bready malts, but they get whacked in to submission by the booze and spice. Although not offensive, it's simply not the best-tasting pumpkin ale I've had. Not by a long shot. That said, the mouthfeel is quite nice. Creamy, perfectly carbonated with medium viscosity. Overall, this is a decent representation. I wonder if this beer would age well, perhaps mellowing some of the sharper edges with the spice and alcohol. Perhaps this one would be better with a slightly lower ABV? It's rare that I would suggest going smaller, but in this case, I feel like the higher gravity detracts from the beer. As with most quality brews, as it warmed and through the middle of the glass, the flavor profiles came together a bit more. Worth a try for sure, especially if you like palate-wrecking spiced beers. A tad overrated in my humble opinion. If you want a big pumpkin beer, try Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin. Of course, there's always Pumking for the over-the-top pumpkin experience.  Personally, I recommend Smuttynose if you can get it.","JohnnyI","Dec 23, 2014"

The scent it gives off is comprised of brown sugar, slightly caramelized, with hints of vanilla, allspice, and cinnamon.  The smell is vaguely creamy, with a hint of pumpkin.   On the palate, it starts off slightly sweet, with a moderate mouth feel, and a delicate carbonization.  Flavor wise, it’s full of brown sugar, light caramelization, cinnamon, allspice, and a touch of nutmeg.  The pumpkin element is subdued, but still present, in a distinctly squashy kind of way.  It finishes on the spicier side, with touches of butter and a hint of bitterness.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 26, 2014"

Starting off quite spicy, I was initially fearful that this one would end up like some other pumpkin beers I've tried (namely Pumpkinhead from Brewdog) but thankfully this one was a lot more balanced & enjoyable, definitely one I'd pick up each year if it were available here in the UK.","flyingpig","Nov 06, 2014"

4.75,20.6,,,,,,"Overall: For me, this was a fantastic beer all around. I have very little bad to say about it, other than that I almost wonder if the name should be more like an "autumn beer," or "fall brew," or something like that, rather than a pumpkin beer -- although pumpkin surely comes in at the end. Still, I'm giving it a 4.75/5 so I'm searching for an issue, here. In reality,  It's the type of beer that would compliment a heart beef stew and work perfectly on a cold late-autumn day. The spices, hops, and carbonation are all perfect for me in this and the hint of pumpkin makes it that much better. I could go on and on, but this is a beer that ranks very high on my list of "must haves."","BeerHistoryGuy","Nov 03, 2014"

I have a feeling that this may be the point of this Pumpkin Ale: to be a session beer that goes down easy, and in turn, multiples can be enjoyed. It's also a beer that most people can appreciate, including non-beer lovers. Very broad in its approach. Again, this is not nearly as bold as I thought it might be. Sam usually likes to push the envelope with his beers, but this one holds back. Still nicely balanced and nothing to complain about! However, I would have to be honest and say, it is a SLIGHT disappointment for me personally given that it doesn't differ too much when comparing it to other pumpkin ales on the market. Brooklyn Brewery's Post Road is not far off from this and is more widely available. This is still a great beer!","Agent1","Oct 20, 2014"

Has good pumpkin flavor, not overpowering and not as sweet as some of the others I have tasted.  This beer has a bit of a bite to it in my opinion.  The spices are very well blended for a delicious tasting beer!  Best of luck finding this gem this late in the season...although, I did find a place earlier today that still had several cases available.  Needless to say, I bought one!!!  Happy drinking everyone!!!","rob111270","Oct 16, 2014"

It is very subtle, especially compared to other popular pumpkin beers like Souther Tier. This allows the beer to be totally sessionable while still giving some of the spicy fall notes people look for in pumpkin beers. Punkin pours a beautiful golden amber color with a wispy, foamy head.  It is also quite clear.","kellyej","Sep 20, 2014"

Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves up front, sweet base malt intersperses in there, giving it sort of a pie crust breadiness. Kind of nice, actually.

You get the usual cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and a hint of some pumpkin. For 7% you can't really taste the alcohol content, best served a little bit on the warmer side to get the full flavors and aromas to pop. Not a real heavy beer, great for any fall day, and even winter. Not much head on this beer more like a half a finger then some lacing afterwards. Pours dark amber.","GrantW","Sep 06, 2014"
4,1.5,,,,,,"This pours a semi-clear amber color with a slight head. The aroma is mild with pumpkin, clove, and spices. The flavor is rich with pumpkin and spices.

3.75,-4.8,,,,,,"Overall, I think $12 for the 4-pack of this is pretty unwarranted for what you get, and you'd be better off getting a six of a number of pumpkins that I would consider better (or, get a six of DFH Indian Brown!). I think this ale relies heavily on ABV and the DFH name, and doesn't really stand out so much in the lineup of pumpkin ales. This is just a standard pumpkin ale to me with more alcohol; lacks the complexity or distinction that would land it in a $12 4-pack.","BeerWizard","Aug 28, 2014"

Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and vegetal pumpkin notes.  Taste brings more of that vegetal pumpkin flavors others shy away from.  Caramel like malt plays host to cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.  Seems like two parts with one carrying great vegetal pumpkin then sweet malt and spices but it never comes together.  Sharper on the mouthfeel than I'd like here.  Higher carbonation and slightly thinner end of medium mouthfeel.  Overall it's a decent pumpkin ale, not the best but I enjoy a couple every year.","HopBomb515","Aug 21, 2014"

GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern pint...OCCASION: it's me (Vernon Davis) and an 18-point lead against Steven Jackson and Tony Gonzalez for the fantasy championship... APPEARANCE: solid, warm amber body; steady effervescence; nice two-finger head; cloudy white and consistent, attractive lacing... AROMA: cinnamon, allspice and hazel nut front and center; a veritable pumpkin pie in a glass, at least by its smell... PALATE: medium-bodied but feisty--not the usual walk-in-the-ho-hum-fall-forest body of a brown; aftertaste is nuanced and bold...TASTE: robust cinnamon overpowers the pumpkin; secondary nutmeg and allspice develop; the cornucopia builds with hazelnut and sugary ginger... OVERALL: I needed a beer big enough to celebrate a win and strong enough to kick in my teeth if I lose--and lose I did with barely a minute to gp in the game.

Pours slightly cloudy deep orange amber color with a 2 finger moderately dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pumpkin, caramel, brown sugar, pear, apple, cinnamon, clove, toast, biscuit, nutmeg, herbal, floral, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of pumpkin, brown sugar, caramel, pear, apple, biscuit, toast, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, herbal, floral, and herbal/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, pear, apple, brown sugar, caramel, biscuit, toast, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice and well balanced pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; but seems lacking in flavor robustness; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin ale. Well balanced pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; but the flavor profile really doesn’t hit all the right notes for me. Still nicely enjoyable and smooth to drink overall.","superspak","Dec 07, 2013"

I'm not sure why people seem to like this so much, there are a lot of other better pumpkins out there that most people have access to. All in all I'd say its slightly above average but only because there are so many breweries out that make a shitty pumpkin beer only trying to cash in on the style. It's worth trying but for the amount you're spending on a 4-pack of this I'd go for a different pumpkin depending on what you have access to.","DevinK","Oct 31, 2013"

I love DFHB, I love the lengths they go for their consumers and for their own quality of product. However, this was unpleasant at times. I understand what they went for here, but a pumpkin is a squash, and I know they are very floral when opened, but if you bite into a pumpkin, it is very watery, little to no flavor. I can see the purpose of the brown sugar, but I would have liked to have tasted more of a sweetness throughout the beer. This was completely unbalanced. All in all, I will not be having this again.

Vegetal, spicy, and slightly sweet, this is more the direction that I like these kinds of beers to head towards.

It's also reasonably complex and only offers a mild spice note. But to me, it still tastes a little uninspired. It's been a while since I've properly enjoyed something from DFH (I think it was a 2011 bottle of WWS), and this doesn't quite change my mind about that.","ThisWangsChung","Sep 28, 2013"

The body is medium-light with solid effervescence and a slightly thin but frisky feel. A very authentic pumpkin brew.","Durge","Sep 19, 2013"

It is a pumpkin ale however and that isn't always everyone's favorite, but with that being said there really aren't any pumpkin ales that live up to the DFH offering. It's something about anyone can enjoy. It's not too sweet, too much spice, or too much pumpkin pie character. It's a well balanced beauty that's fit to enjoy.

The taste is totally autumn in a bottle, lots of pumpkin pie spice flavor all the way through. Lighter bodied and it goes down silky smooth. Very good example of the style.","KidKrafty","Sep 01, 2013"

This and Pumpking are on the short list of the best in my opinion. This is pricey at $8.99/four, but this truly is excellent. This beer succeeds by doing less of what other pumpkin ales do (others often have too much pumpkin, not enough balance of pumpkin and spice, too much carbonation, or pumpkin that does not taste fresh). This is a must try.","DeFaz","Sep 01, 2013"

There's coriander, cloves, and, of course pumpkin flavor that dominate each sip. What's so fantastic about this is that you don't all these flavors at once; they wash over your mouth individually. It's like eating a delicious pumpkin spice-cake. My only complaint is that each bottle is 250 calories! I only drink one per sitting due to the calorie count. Other than that there's nothing I can fault this delicious beer over!","JGargano","Mar 16, 2013"

There is a nice note of caramel malt, as well as a light "holiday" spice mix. The taste is slightly sweet, almost no bitterness at all, and a noticeable alcohol characteristic at the end. Medium carbonation and body, the beer is quite drinkable for it's strength. Finishes fairly clean, overall a refreshing beer, not very much pumpkin flavor to speak of. It's also fairly difficult to find and expensive, so try it if you like, but there are better pumpkins in my opinion.","scvance","Dec 09, 2012"

Surely one of the best pumpkin beers I've had yet that really tastes like you've just roasted a pumpkin in the oven, pureed it and drank it down, and have it taste delicious. Where others have left it too light, this one hits the sweet spot in malt sweetness, complexity and hearty pumpkin goodness. I'd definitely hunt this one down another fall and recommend it as nearly everyone else does as a top of the notch pumpkin flavoured ale.","4ster","Oct 31, 2012"

Dogfish Head has produced a very balanced, meticulously spiced beer that not only feels like fall, but warms you during those cooler months as well. You get a good dose of cinnamon & nutmeg on the nose and palate. Pumpkin flavor is mild, which benefits the overall profile of the beer. It does come through on the nose like a fresh pie. Good, dry finish too. I would buy a pack of these every season. One is enough for the season, but it's something to look forward to (like many great seasonals).","TheRealBigC","Oct 25, 2012"

Smell was of carmel, brown sugar and some spices. Very nice aroma. Taste follows the nose with a huge front end of carmel malts and great blend of spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar, cloves). I like that it has the ale qualities and is more of a spiced brown vs. a pumpkin bomb. Very well balanced and great blend. A little hop finish, but focus is on the carmel and spice. Feel is medium with some carbonation and a bit of thickness for the tongue. Overall- A very solid spiced ale that has the balance of malts and spice. It's not over the top and IMO is one of the best I have had. Sessionable and easy to enjoy this time of year. Like that it is a brown first with the spice/flavor to compliment.

There's a solid malt backbone that gives some sweetness, with the spices adding a complimentary peppery flavor. It's a very nice balance.

There seems to be a tendancy for this style to consist of a run of the mill ale that is spiced like a pumpkin pie. You can tell this ale was built from the ground up to work as a pumpkin beer. My only complaint is that they call it a brown ale, and it is not brown, which threw me off at first. I wish I could get more than just the one four-pack, this is autumn in a glass.","Siriusfisherman","Oct 14, 2012"

I personally prefer my pumpkin ales a little more pumpkin-rich, but this beer is absolutely outstanding and warrants a try from anyone who's not yet enjoyed it.","BeerFMAndy","Oct 10, 2012"

A hint of pumpkin emerged followed by a light sweet after taste from the sugars. They say its a full body ale, but I somewhat disagree on that aspect.

On the nose, it’s all those wonderful fall smells you hope for with a pumpkin beer: cinnamon, clove and hints of pumpkin. I’m all about pumpkin, so this is right in my wheelhouse. On the taste, there is a lot of hearty pumpkin which is sweet on the end. The fall spice is a little more subtle in the taste and lets the pumpkin flavor take the front seat. It reminds me of a less sweet pumpkin pie. The finish is quick, but the booze is easily hidden. This is easily one of the best pumpkin beer offerings around.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

This beer had good drinkability, it went down smoothly and had enough flavors to hold my attention. two would probably be my limit with this beer, it's a great choice for a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was the taste and the aroma, they were pretty good and just what I expect from a Pumpkin Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of carbonation, it was a little overboard and that made for a prickly mouthfeel. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good Pumpkin Ale, but it's a little on the expensive side so I can't see myself filling my fridge with it, but I recommend that anyone who likes Pumpkin Ales to give this beer a try. All in all I was satisfied with this Pumpkin Ale and so far it's the best one I have had this year, but it isn't the best one I have had, Screaming Pumpkin still has that title, but it was still good nonetheless and was much better then the last two Pumpkin Ale's I've had, good job Dogfish Head, this is one solid Pumpkin Ale.","StoutHunter","Sep 15, 2012"

The appearance is a copper tan which poured an 1/2 inch head which quickly dissapated. The nose was actually kinda yeasty sour when first poured but when it warmed I could smell the cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and brown sugar. I actually liked the taste when it was cold but again as it warmed one could tasted the cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and brown sugar and the alocohol was not noticeable. It got beeter. Mouthfeel is kinda medium. Overall at this moment this is my favorite of the style and the first year thus far that I've actually enjoyed drinking on a regular basis.

If the head formation, retention, and lacing were better, the appearance would get higher marks, as well.

And I'm noticing new things this time. A lot more brown sugar in the nose and taste than I noted in my original review. I don't know if I drank the first one too cold or what...but the caramel maltiness, brown sugar, and sweetness is coming out more this time around. Just thought I'd give a few additional thoughts on this one. I normally don't repeat beers very often because I'm on a "try everything you can" kick, but I'm going to make sure I have this in my fridge on a consistent basis this Fall.

Dogfish hasn't lost sight of the fact that they're still making a *BEER* here. The pumpkin/spice addition is pleasant, but not overwhelming.

Smells of Halloween and fall time - nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, and pumpkin meat - amazing aroma. Taste doesn't disappoint and follows up with more of the same. Any fresh hops have faded away by now but not needed anyway. Great beer and looking forward to the next batch.","Oakenator","Aug 26, 2012"

4.17,5.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Well this is definitely a treat, the Dogfish Punkin' Ale is the best pumpkin beer I've had yet this year! Great amount of pumpkin flavors, as well as spices, and the two are balanced nicely. I really enjoy the Smashed Pumpkin for it's heavy, up-front pumpkin flavors; and the Heavy Seas Great Pumpkin for it's heavy use of pumpkin pie spices. The Dogfish Punkin' Ale is not too intense in any direction or the other, it's balanced just right.","TheCorkStopsHere","Jan 08, 2012"

PumKing is always been at the top of my list in this style, but this is a very close second. I stated earlier in the review, but the brown sugar stands out making this brew flavorful and sweet, but not to sweet. Great Job DFH","mattgreger","Jan 04, 2012"

Upon reviewing this beer at the end of December, I was immediately taken back to feeling of attending Halloween parties and handing out candy to trick or treaters. This is a very well done pumpkin ale that is perfectly spiced and well balanced. A staple of the Fall. I look forward to it every year.","FattyJLE","Dec 26, 2011"

Curiously high carbonation and an overwhelmingly thin feel. My guess is this would be a massive hit among the BMC drinkers, as it tastes like a Miller infused with pie spice.

There's a subtle sweetness, that is not cloying and leaves the brew quite drinkable. This is beer, not a soft drink! Yet, the pumpkin is there and center stage.

4.32,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into my dimpled mug. Punkin pours a relatively clear orange fading to amber, with a small head made up of very tiny bubbles that rise maybe a quarter of an inch above the liquid. The aroma is at once arresting and intoxicating; liquid pumpkin pie. Spices hit the nose first, with nutmeg, clove, and spice arriving simultaneously. Pumpkin follows, though there’s also this candied yams type character as well. From the moment the beer hits your lips you know you’re in for a treat, as a crusty malt backbone holds all of the pumpkin pie flavors in place. This beer is roughly a month old; and the taste is somewhat faded. My previous experience with this beer was near euphoric; the age on the beer hasn’t done it any favors, and dropped it into the echelon of very good. That’s not to say this beer is no longer worth your time, as it remains one of the shining examples of this style. The malt in this beer acts as a framing, much as a pie crust does in a pie. There are no hops here, and why should there be … this is a unique beer and hops would just get in the way of the flavor profile of the spices and pumpkin. Too often brewers get heavy handed with spicing beers of this type, luckily the folks at Dogfish have not fallen prey to this mistake. A very enjoyable take on the pumpkin beer style and one I wish that I could sample more often.","eclaycamp","Oct 28, 2011"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale, though "good" is as good a rating as the beer deserves. There's nothing stellar about the brew, and the slightly overpowering presence of spices somewhat detracts from the flavor profile. And unlike many pumpkin beers, the pumpkin isn't front-and-center here, but simply adds a layer of flavor to what is otherwise a brown ale (unlike, say, Pumking, which tastes almost exclusively of pumpkin pie). Perhaps this is a good thing, as the pumpkin flavors do blend better here than in many brews. I only wish the spices did the same.","jondeelee","Oct 26, 2011"

The nutmeg/cinnamon aspect really dominates the drink for me, while the squashy pumpkin comes off as a secondary flavor via a slight linger. Perhaps I'd try this again on tap, but it really just tastes like another generic pumpkin beer to me. Though I will say despite being very tame/mellow, it's well balanced. A decent beer that is probably quite a bit better super fresh.","Cavery","Oct 17, 2011"

3.98,1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A roasted pumpkin color almost brown but glinting with orange loveliness. A moderate head fading after a few, leaving a light covering. The pumpkin is so well integrated into the solid malt core of this beer. It makes for a pumpkin bread like aroma with a firm note of sweet alcohol. Maybe a little too firm as it gives a bit of an edge that detracts a touch. An earthy hop balance is a nice counter to the sweet stuff. Taste is a unique combination of grainy malt and pumpkin that gives an overall dryness to the brew. Some nice spices with cinnamon and nutmeg. Lightly burnt caramel and fusel alcohol sweetness flow into a bready finish with earth and faint graham. Feel is medium weight and mildly carbonated. Kind of a cross between a regular and imperial. It is pretty drinkable so use caution. As it warms the alcohol tucks in a bit and the malt reveals a light coffee flavor that also shows in the nose. Drinkability goes up and the overall taste profile improves both just under the next score up. Good stuff this something to look forward to in the fall.","scootny","Oct 16, 2011"
4.1,4.1,4,4,4.5,3,4,"O: I can't say enough about this beer. As I've been going on quite a fall-seasonal beer tear, this has got to be the best thus far. The pumpkin is right in your face and not hidden by any spices, which is pretty common with pumkin ales i feel. Also, there is a nice balance of malt and hops here that makes it very pleasent to drink. I love this brew. I wish Dogfish wasn't down in Delaware, cause I'd be soliciting at their doorstep trying to get in and bathe in the kettle every day.","Kc4shore","Oct 15, 2011"
3.91,-0.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall (4.0): Punkin is very well balanced. What I hate about most pumpkin beers is the overemphasis on spice. Take a sniff, take a sip, and it’s half the spices in your cabinet flying in your face all at once with no tact whatsoever. Generally speaking I don’t like beers that are overpoweringly this, that or anything—I like the balance, the integration, the dance of flavors. This actually does that pretty well. My one complaint is, I wish there was some more pumpkin. I always seem to want more pumpkin from my pumpkin beers. Still, this is a good one and very well balanced.","fmccormi","Oct 15, 2011"

3.46,-12.2,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Finally reviewing this stuff during, like, my twelfth tasting of it. Geez... It pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises apple juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel. Save the light spicing, there ain't too much pumpkin (pie or otherwise) character going on here so far. The taste holds notes of mandarin orange syrup, cinnamon, green apple skin, brown sugar, nutmeg, and a very light bit of toasted rye bread. The pumpkin character is still pretty nonexistent, but at least the combination tastes good. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a more-than-decent brew, but not exactly the most pumpkin-y thing out there. Generally enjoyable, though...","TMoney2591","Sep 26, 2011"

Subtle hits of cinnamon and other pumpkin pie spices are noticeable but not overwhelming. It says it has brown sugar, but I'm not picking up any. The mouthfeel is rather thin, which is ok, but I think it could have a little more carbonation. Overall, its the best pumpkin ale that I have tried.

The smell is predominantly cinnamon and nutmeg with a slight hint of pumpkin and rye. Taste is all about lightly sweetened pumpkin pie. The dominant flavors are nutmeg and cinnamon, but the focus on those spices helps make this beer quite drinkable. The beer is a little light on the body. This beer needs to coat the tongue a little more considering it's a fall/winter beer. All in all, this is a good beer, and I enjoyed trying it, even though it is not my style.

The head started massive out of the bottle, but settles into a more reasonable half inch of off-white, big bubbled, frothy head. Aromas are heavy with spice, and I could pick up a lot of nutmeg and all-spice, with a sweet pumpkin background. Flavors are roasted, and you get a great blend of the pumpkiin and malt sweetness to balance out all the spicy characteristics. The beer laces the glass heavily, and the body is smooth and creamy, with a sharpness to it from the spicing. The aftertaste is surprisingly short-lived, with a slight pumpkin pie flavor, and the finish is spiced, short and sweet. Tasty fall brew!","GarthDanielson","Sep 07, 2011"

The beige head rises to about two fingers in stature, but doesn't stick around all that long, nor does it leave much evidence of its former existence. Nose is pretty much what one would expect from a well made pumpkin ale. Pumpkin comes through, along with an intriguing blend of spices (cinnamon and nutmeg come through better than the allspice). Brown sugar was advertised on the bottle, and while it didn't show up in the aroma it comes through just fine on the front end of each sip. That and an improved allspice presence among the pumpkin and spices on the back end really take this beer to the next level. Carbonation is fine, middle of the road in terms of intensity. Punkin could stand to be a little bit more rich though, the body comes across as a little thin for a decent sized pumpkin ale. Punkin is a very good beer, it's got a great flavor but some of the other aspects are just a bit off. Still, another quality beer from Dogfish Head.","axeman9182","Nov 21, 2010"

Pours a copper/burnt orange color, semitransparent. Surprisingly large head with outstanding lacing. Smells of nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, smells like a bakery. Massive amounts of cinnamon come to the forefront of the palate, with nutmeg and other, more subtle spices coming to prominence halfway through the taste, and the alcohol pokes its head through during the finish in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, the finish is a bit rough, but it is full bodied and filling.

The dominant flavors are nutmeg and cinnamon, but the focus on those spices helps make this beer quite drinkable. The beer seems to be a little light on the body. This beer to coat the tongue a little more considering it's a fall/winter beer. All in all, this is a good beer, and if one plans on drinking more than one, all is well.","DamDweller","Nov 17, 2010"

Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, anise, all these and probably more are in there. There is also a fresh pumpkin smell like when you carve into a jack-o-lantern. Flavor is malty sweet and fruity at first. More of that fresh pumpking smell/taste comes out. The spice takes over every other flavor quickly. In the end, the only other flavor is a hint of booze on my lips. I've never been a fan of the spiced pumpkin beers. Every fall I try to keep an open mind, but the spices always turn me off.

It, of course, poured with abundant head - cottony, fluffy. leaving strands of lacing. Yellowish amber hue and clean. Wonderful balance in aroma and flavor. Spices are present, thankfully not in a pumpkin pie bouquet, but they merely lend touches to what is actually a lovely pumpkin/malt blend. The pumpkin (and some faint nuttiness) steps forward in the taste, while the malt and spices seem to lead the scent. What I really appreciate and enjoy here is that the pumpkin is featured quite well, not pushed down or muted by a loud lousy concoction of pie flavorings, as many of these ales are. The pumpkin comes across a little roasty as well. The beer drinks medium-bodied, clean, and somewhat dry. An all-around well-constructed pumpkin ale experience.","Bouleboubier","Nov 05, 2010"

All of this was accompanied by nutmeg, brown sugar and allspice - all of which are extremely complimenting of each other; no one flavor tries to dominate the others. The mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body, like a heavy silk, and everything is supported by just the right amount of carbonation.

I'm not a huge pumpkin ale lover, but I am a DFH lover, so I was compelled to try this. I recall trying 4 or 5 different pumpkin ales last fall and each of them left me feeling like I was drinking a glass of potpourri. The DFH Punkin Ale was nothing like the others.

I can smell pumpkin for one, along with all the spices used in the making. I think the nutmeg comes out especially nice and complimented nicely with a touch of spicy cinnamon. This really smells like what I think a pumpkin beer should be; pumpkin followed by Autumn spices. As good as an aroma as a pumpkin beer gets in my opinion. The taste reminds me of pumpkin loaf. You know, the stuff they sell at Starbucks. Take that and add a nice malt backbone and you've got a solid form of this. Rich malts followed by nutmeg flavor finishes nicely with the perfect amount of pumpkin. Possibly my favorite pumpkin beer right here. The mouthfeel is good, the carbonation being nice a subtle to compliment the medium body. This leaves a bit of spiciness on my tongue after a few sips but it still drinks very well.

Little to no hop bitterness but at the same time it isn't overly sweet like many other examples of the style. The mouthfeel too is good nice full body with moderate carbonation lead to a pleasant beer. This is my favorite pumpkin ale by far.

Some pumpkin beers are too spicy, this one's spices match with the malt body and carbonation to create a great package. Nice squach flavor backed up by allspice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and great malt charecter. Mouthfeel is also bomber, smooth caramelly.

It smells more like beer than pumpkin, with malt, nutmeg and clove being dominant. Tastewise, there's a lot of nutmeg and some cardamom thrown in for good measure.

Alcohol is barely noticeable, good balance of malt while somehow managing to still account for a hop presence in a pumpkin beer.

This brew seems to be working away from the sweet spices and more towards a more realistic pumpkin pie (at least as far I as remember) by not being overly sweet and somewhat savory (from the gourd flavor). The toasty brown ale malts show up and fresh bread and there is a slight hop edge, that's just slightly bitter, to add complexity to the flavor. There is a vegetable flavor, like pumpkin seeds and meat with the blend of spices balancing it out. Overall this is a well balanced and tasty brew, but I would have liked more push from all the pumpkin flavors.

Backbone is moderately thick malt that similarly blends with a sweet-starchy pumpkiny body, like pumpkin pie beer. Taste is also pumpkin pie, with a moderate hop adding oomph to the spice and a moderate bit of marzen-like malt adding body to the pumpkin.

Smells of buttery pumpkins and squash with graham crackers, pie spices and molasses present, but not overpowering. The taste is clearly of pumpkin, with a proper dose of spice as a little bonus rather than the main taste. Sweet and biscuity malt centered beer with just enough hops to make the beer balanced. Feels nice and rich and appropriately carbonated. Tasty and reminds me of a good home-made pumpkin bread or pumpkin pie, not the overly sweet or spiced stuff found most places.

The flavor is stronger than the aromas and has a good, bold pumpkin flavor to it with spices trailing, maybe cinnamon and a slight amount of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is interesting. It poured so light and watery but it drinks a little thicker than you'd expect. It's very drinkable. I really appreciate that the flavor is pumpkin heavy as opposed to all spices.

Very interesting. The taste is delicious! I get all the flavors mentioned in the scent, but with more spiciness and hop profile. I'm surprised by how hoppy it is.

Smells mildy soapy, but yet spicey, and a lot like pumpkin pie. Not detecting much alcohol in the nose for such a strong ale, can detect some maltiness in here as well, as a brown ale should. Now the taste of this beer is where it blows all the other pumpkin ales away, it is like an amped up pumpkin ale and everything else seems like a watery compromise, like a lager with spices and stale pumpkin powder. THIS beer however, is extraordinarily complex. I can taste the cinnamon spice on the tip of my tongue, and at times the spicyness almost feels kinda prickly on the tonque, in a good way, like it is fresh ground. The pumpkin melds together with the malts to give it breadyness that is comforting like, well, a warm slice of pumpkin pie. The malts do have a solid toffy flavor of a brown ale. Not much presence from the hops aside from a backend bitterness and slight whiffs in the cornucupia of aromas in my glass. . Mouthfeel is rich and full. I've been on the lookout for one of these for years, finally tried one (thanks to DiCarlo's Liquors of Mundelein, IL). This is the new standard for a pumpkin ale, everything else is wayy behind.

The pumpkin, the sweetness, the spiciness is all there and melds perfectly together. It's really hard to imagine another beer being able to do the same thing to such a perfect degree. In terms of style the taste cannot be beat, at least as far as I can tell.

Though it's 7% ABV (not bad), you can taste a slight amount of heat. Here's to the heat, though, I've been taking cold showers all week and fall is fast approaching.

Huge huge pumpkin, nutmeg and spicy aroma. Really one of the better, more focused pumpkin beers. The flavor is completely balanced between all of the spices. Dry finish with a nutmeg finish. Graham cracker malts and a pungent yam, brown sugar and even marshmallow component. The complexity begs for a roasted pork dish and turkey legs. Mouthfeel is perfect. The weight of this beer is phenomenal. Really balanced carbonation with this brew.

There is a light bitterness at mid-mouth with a finish that started out full and rich but got sharper with warming and a bit earthier.

Smells of all the pumpkin and spice goodness of many pumpkin ales but surpasses its competitors by using a healthy heap of biscuity and toasty malts. Unlike other pumpkin ales I've tried, the cinnamon and vanilla are not overwhelming - the sweetness is actually balanced by hops. A highly enjoyable beer.","droomyster","Oct 07, 2009"

Gorgeous deep gold to amber in the glass with subtle carbonation and a nice head that fell rather quickly, but left a ring of foam that laced the glass nicely all the way down. Pumpkin spices--cinnamon, nutmeg (I guess)--immediately evident in the nose, but quickly found them to be very well balanced in the flavor. Rich mouthfeel and recognizably buttery malt balanced with a nice hops bitterness, a subtle fruity spice (the pumpkin spices) all blended nicely on the tongue. Unbelievable balance and complexity. Easily (now) my new favorite pumpkin ale. The 7% ABV was a bit of a put off when I saw it on the label, as I assumed that astringency would be noticed as the beer warmed. That wasn't the case. This was incredibly drinkable from start to finish. Fantastic.","tugdriver7","Oct 07, 2009"

Aroma is sticky sweet sugar, like cinnamon buns. Pumpkin is also detectable in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with big malt sweetness upfront in the flavor. There's brown sugar and pie spice flavors in there too. There's a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish and a slight alcohol warmth as it goes down.

The white head did not stick around too long. The aroma reminded me of an amber with evidence of the pumpkin pie spices. The taste is caramel malts and more pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice) The mouthfeel is rather light for a beer of this sweetness. I probably wouldn't want to drink too many of these on account of the sweetness, not really a session beer.

Smell: a nice toasted scent that when thinking of pumpkins reminds me of toasting pumpkin seeds, caramel sweetness, spice - i think primarily the allspice and a touch of cinnamon. There is a vague sweet squash smell, which I could be convinced is pumpkin. From 10,000 ft, I guess there's a pumpkin pie motif here, but I don't get that fresh baked pie scent I was hoping for. Taste: toffee, brown sugar, toasted, cinnamon and allspice (and maybe nutmeg). I don't really get pumpkin, but with the creamy start to the mouthfeel I can imagine eating a whipped cream heavy bite of pumpkin pie. Unfortunately the sip ends with a feel like eating ground cinnamon straight out of the jar. Overall, this is a nice beer without the added search for the great pumpkin.

The aftertaste is actually kind of bitter, slightly hoppy and acidic-tangy from the pumpkin meat. Sweet, but not overly sweet like so many DFH brews. Sweetness is brown sugar, sometimes molasses. Carbonation is medium, though it appears lively. This is one of the better Pumpkin beers out there, with a nice alcohol kick as well.","dasenebler","Sep 21, 2009"

Not as alluring as I would like but not bad. The flavor brings more to the table than the aroma. The same spices are there but seem fuller and more developed. The cinnamon comes forward and marries with the fruity pumpkin taste that's subtle but noticeable. It nicely carbonated and somewhat refreshing which is nice given the spice-forwardness of this beer. Feels rather full bodied but doesn't stick to the palate. I could have used a little more hop fruitiness to balance it out I think but it wasn't a huge problem. Seems like a good pairing for an apple pie with a nice dollop of whipped cream.","apbarwood","Sep 19, 2009"

You can totally taste the alcohol in this one and even though the pumpkin taste is very good and very real it does not make up for how boring the rest of the brew is. I don't know if I just do not care for these pumpkin brews. I have had a minor handful of them, (not talking dogfish head) and still have one that i thoroughly enjoy. The only reason i come back to them is because i love pumpkin but have not yet found one that translates into beer. I would totally pass on this one, i think dogfish gets to much credit for beers that all taste the same in ways. Overpriced and not worth it.","throwthechaff","Sep 19, 2009"

Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty drink, but the problem I have with it is that taste of pumpkin goes away after a few sips and becomes more of just a mildly spiced ale. So it's a little more on the spiced side and a little dryer then most pumpkin ales. Also, not as sweet.

The flavor is not as strong. Some pumpkin follow by pumkin spice. Vanilla seems rather strong. A nice oaky flavor with a touch of hop bite coming in at the end. Not as strong a pumpkin flavor as I had hoped but enought to satisfy me. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall a well put together pumpkin ale.

3.8,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A pretty good looking beer. Pours a color that's darker than amber, but slightly lighter than tea with excellent clarity. Doesn't really have much of a head. There was very little left by the time it was brought to me and what was left pretty much stuck around the edges. Had far less than average lacing, but all in all looked pretty nice. The smell was pretty good. Spices from pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread, followed by some roasted malts. I'm not really a fan of Pumpkin styles beers (with the exception of Cape Ann's Pumpkin Stout) but this was pretty good. It has the sweet taste that you would expect. However it's not overly sweet like most pumpkin style ales. I kind of wonder if there are roasted pumpkin seeds in this brew instead of the sweet pumpkin spices of most pumpkin beers. It actually tastes like a beer as well, not like it should be warm with a head of whipped cream topped with a little nutmeg and cinnamon. Mouthfeel is good, no carbination or alcohol bite at all. I'd say the drinkability is good too I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3.5 cause I'm generally not a fan of this style but it was way better than I expected. All in all pretty good. I would not get this regularly but certainly get it again if in the mood and given the opportunity.","AndyAvalanche","Aug 27, 2009"

Taste is all pumpkin up front, ALL pumpkin, and then mingling in is a nice cocoa/chocolate taste. There are some malts present, but not picking up much spicing... it was pumpkin and chocolate and it was GOOD. Medium body, medium carbonation, nice thick creamy feel on the tongue.

Mouthfeel is decent, straightforward fall pumpkin beer. A bit watery, but still better than a lot of Pumpkin Ale's I've had.

Some light cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste has a bit much cinnamon for me. It's pretty harsh up front. There is still some brown sugar and other spices. Far from what I picked up in the nose in terms of balance. It's here and there with the flavors, never balancing them as one but showcasing them seemingly one at a time. Cinnamon up front for sure along with other spices, a little sugary sweetness and bready finish. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and smooth. Light dryness in the finish, maybe from the spice? The aftertaste brings memories of the crust, which isn't as apparent in the initial flavor. Damn, if only this lived up to the nose. Still not a bad pumpkin beer by any means. It's kind of big.

The hops kick in nicely in the flavor along with the- you guessed it- pumpkin, adding a little crispness and spicyness. The mouthfeel has a nice medium body. The alcohol isn't overly perceptible in the taste but after drinking half a bottle I could already feel it at work. The brown sugar offers a nice nutty complement to the pumpkin as well.

I was expecting this to taste like carbonated pumpkin juice, but there really isn't a whole lot of pumpkin flavor jumping out at you. It's nice, spicy will a hint of pumpkin in the background. Pumpkin is much more noticeable in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is great. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this much, since I've had bad experiences with blueberry flavored beers. But this was a nice surprise. It's not an overwhelming pumpkin flavor.

The taste is on the money too, again the pumpkin pulls through with the cinnamon, some nutmeg and brown sugar. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Smooth mouthfeel.

Depth and complexity that I havent come to expect from pumpking beers. Bold mineral based richness up front with a nice hop feel to balance.

The clear pumpkin color of the ale coupled with the intense pumpkin pie aroma is a world apart from other pumpkin brews. The taste is complex - spicy, sweet, and and roasted like a piece of pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and well suited to this style.

Nose is spicy, lightly boozy, and lightly tangy-sweet; inclusion of brown sugar is evident. My impressions on the first sip are of a sweet, smooth, and moderately full-bodied brew. Punchy . . . definitely wears its 7% with style. Light notes of cherry and angelfood cake, and even a lightly-spiced 'plain cake donut' - very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly tangy, lightly warming from the higher alcohol, and with remarkably good drinkability. Leans toward a dessert beer but I could easily knock back a few of these. This is the biggest Pumpkin brew (ale or otherwise) I've ever sampled, and yet it has remarkable balance, even to the point of a drier finish than I'd first expected. I'd say that this one might win over a few of the people who haven't yet warmed to the Pumkin-in-a-beer crowd, as it really brings everything together nicely.","Chaz","Nov 26, 2007"

Not too overbearing but there's no denying that it's there. The better half said she liked it but had her thinking that someone tipped a little bit of a nut brown ale into the pie batter.

Obviously, you have your spice, again with nutmeg and clove, but maybe some cinnamon in there, plenty of sweet caramel malts, but also a tangy, dry finish to provide the slightest bit of bitterness at the end. I'm a big fan of pumpkin ales, I always look forward to the fall, and I think this is one of my favorite examples of the style.

4.75,20.6,,,,,," So to the beer. Good color, nice dark brown sugar color with decent glass lacing. hints of brown sugar, molassess and cloves in the nose. The beer, folks, is nuanced. It will not give you the pumpkin pie effect, more the effect is a good hoppy ale giving credence to the season and time. The pumpkin taste as well as aroma is subtle and is meant to be subtle to compliment the hops character. I find that this exudes a great balanace to this beer. I wonder what the hops are? still have not been able to figure that out because that is subtle as well but definitely presistant present. Look at this beer as a hopped brown ale with pumpkin overtones that. i feel, are consistenlty present from first sip through taste and finish. If you can approach that way and like hops, you will defintely enjoy this beer. This is the perfect beer to enjoy raking leaves or chopping wood. In my house, this is one of our standard thanksgiving fare. Great beer. Enjoy and thanks to Dogfish for keeping it a bit off center but still wonderfully excellent.","sublimesipping","Oct 27, 2007"

There's even a hint of alcohol in the finish as the beer warms. Dogfish Head does an excellent job of balancing all these flavors, to the point where one doesn't dominate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly chewy. Even at a higher percent, this is a great beer to session on a nice fall night or with an autumn meal.","BBM","Sep 25, 2007"
4.37,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a clear tawny bronze hue, with an off-white foamy two finger head. Good retention produces thick wisps of stubborn lace. You can smell the pumpkin, ginger and cinnamon from a few feet away, and the allspice, nutmeg and toasted malt are obvious as well, with faint caramel in the background. Deeply toasted pale malt and medium crystal upon first sip- deliciously sweet with a hint of tang like muscavado or turbinado ester. A suggestion of dextrin and good dose of vegetal/squash taste transforms into a traditional pumpkin pie flavor complete with slightly peppery fresh ginger, spicy cinnamon, some faint clove and heavy allspice character. The aftertaste is a gradual fading of the malt and spice that reveals a soft but balancing woody english hop flavor and bitterness that balances the remaining malt and pairs nicely with the spices. Most Pumpkin beers I have tried are either light and overly spiced or have a well-rounded flavor but very mild in charatcer overall; this results in a poor mouthfeel, but Dogfish Head has matched a medium-body/residual sugar profile with medium-light carbonation that lifts the sweetness from the toungue in conjunction with the balancing spices/hops. The finish is also gentle and smooth but saturated with complex flavor. This beer really tastes like a slice of pumkin pie dunked in a hearty Northern English Brown ale and is far and away the best Pumpkin ale I have tried to date.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 24, 2007"

The flavors are sharp and dark: pumpkin, the bread again, pie spices. Mouthfeel is bright and effervescent. A tad watery, but not bad.

DFH uses both in great quantity for the ultimate flavor and aroma of pumpkin pie. I also love the bright orange 4-pack.

The more of this I drink the more the spices make a comeback in the finish. Good mouthfeel, nice medium-ish body with low-moderate carbonation. Drinkability is average. I think one of these in a night is enough for me. The dominant spice flavors that only become more intense and ever-present as I drink this beer deter me from having another.

I thought this would have lost some of its bite considering its age, but its holding up well. I have to say, its one of the more enjoyable DFH beers I've head (esp. compared to black and blue).

Its still got all those familiar pumpkin flavors; allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, the somewhat eclipsed pumpkin malt character, and some roasted notes. But, compared to most other pumpkin ales, the spice profile is bolder; the variety of flavor is more complex, the roast character is heavier and its noticeably drier. If you like pumpkin ales, but want more refinement, this might be your favorite once you try it. Recommended.","arguemaniac","Dec 30, 2006"

The taste is alot like the smell, being a basic brown ale, with pumpkins added, but with the other spices taking a back seat. Not as rich in spice as other pumpkin ales that I've tried, but still nonetheless, a great pumpkin beer. A welcome addition to any session, as long as the wallet can afford it.

Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite smooth and easy drinking. I could pick up a slight alcoholic note as the beer warmed to room temperature. Drinkability was fairly high.

The smell is not spicey and stong the way I expected, though I am getting some nutmeg, but mainly it's just a malty smell. The taste is slightly tart, with a suprising amount of cinnamon, along with nutmeg, and malt. There is a slightly bitter finish, but not hoppy, more a combination of bitter barlery and some kind of tannin from the spcies. This whole time I'm wondering if there are actually hops in this. I can't really taste them, but sometimes I think I can smell them. And this leads me to the question of the hour... which flavor is the pumkin? This certainly does not have the hearty and rich character of a pumpkin pie, and even then, what do you taste more in a pumpkin pie... the pumpkin or the spices? I've got to attribute the sour/tartness to the pumpkin, but having no experience with pumpkin brews, its complete speculation. The mouthfeel is pretty typical for a DFH brew, that being a full medium body with a watery, dry finish. Overall, this beer probalby left me with more questions than answers, and for that reason alone I enjoyed it. On top of that, it's a drinkable beer with unique flavors.","zjungleist","Oct 21, 2006"

3.83,-2.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Once again I'm not a Pumpkin beer guy normally, I've reviewed one and thought a counter point would be a good idea, especially when its a dogfish head. Poured an orangey amber color with golden high lights. The head is a white foam color, leaving some lacing, with decent retention. Smells just like it says subtle, but real pumpkin, brown sugar, spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Smells more like an ale with pumpkin/spicing added sparingly, not an over powering smack in the face of synthetic pumpkin pie. Honestly the the smell is not terribly enticing, but its equally not dispelling. The flavor is not as sweet as I expected, its got a bit more tartness and a nice tinge of bitterness. It maintains a nice crisp flavor, some malt complexity and a mellow pumpkin spice finish. For me I'd prefer this type of pumpkin beer to others that use a syrup to flavor and are more forward front with their over sweet pumpkin flavor. Personally this is not as good as some of Dogfish heads other seasonal brews (aprihop) but its definitely not bad. If some one wanted a pumpkin brew, so far I'd say this is the way to go.","mmcave","Oct 20, 2006"

The first sip shows a huge peppery spice ester character, toasted malts, and considerable hop addition. Roasted barley, yeasty. The alcohol presence is fairly potent and mixed with a high hop content it seems to blend the pumpkin pie spices almost too well. Its difficult to discern between all of the spices.

The pumpkin scent also comes through strongly, and I can easily pick out the brown sugar, too. There's also a dry toasty aroma that doesn't jive well with the rest of the nose.

Aroma is rathery pumpkin-like, a bit of hops detected, not much in spice aromas...or maybe the nutmeg and allspice are simply making me think pumkin? Hard to tell. Taste wise its actually a bit pumpkiny, definitely hoppy, and more of a pale ale in style, with yes, a legitimate pumpkin flavor! Spices are subdued and acompany the hops in the finish if any. The 7% is not present in the flavor, which is rather thick. Mouthfeel is medium, and by the now the carbvonation has settled, so okay at this point. Drinabilitywise, It's the best pumpkin beer I've tasted yet by far, though a little less hops could make the pumpkin shine through a bit more, and some might crave more spices. Never knowing the 7% abv here is scary, and the label is the only way we'd know. My favorite brewery does not disapoint, but this beer doesn't make me want to make room for it in the stockpile.

Spices (especially Nutmeg!) overpower any pumpkin flavor there is and the alcohol is very tasteable. Also sense somewhat of a toasty flavor in the finish. Very nice beer and is very hearty. 7.0% is a bit of a kicker too. Nice beer but only for the tough among us. I only got through about two before I needed something a tad lighter. Excellent effort by Dogfish but one word of advice (and this is according to MY taste, not everyone else's) turn it down just a tad.

Aroma was all about pumpkin, with some spice notes (nutmeg) and sugar. The taste was a quick sensory snapshot where I immediately thought of pumpkin seeds - the kind you make after carving a jack-o-lantern and then roasting them in the oven. Malt was toasted, caramel/toffee in the middle, and a very minor hint of hops at the finish which seemed to increase as the beer warmed. Body was light to medium, carbonation was medium, and it was slightly drying. Of the 4 pumpkin beers I have tried, this was the most subtle. It was a really good brown ale, with hints of pumpkin and spice. Well integrated, and I would be happy to drink it again. As a final note, a dangerous beer, because you don't get a hint of the 7% ABV.","","Sep 21, 2006"

The taste is awesome what I smell I taste, just with that bit of hop bitterness that we all love from those crafters at Dogfish, awesome. Don't be fooled when you drink that 4 pack and wonder why it went down so smooth, the alcohol is so well hidden that I can't even detect it. Seeing this just makes me smile knowing that summer is over and fall is upon us, simply beautiful.","gunnerman","Aug 29, 2006"
3.77,-4.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Clear, deep copper colour. Thin head dissolves into a pillowy ring that lingers on. Light roasty malt hits the nose initially, reminds me of an Oktoberfest lager. Inhaling more deeply the faint pumpkin spice notes become evident, nice and cinnamony. The taste carries a toasted malt flavor with a decent sweetness. The pumpkin spice is again very subtle. The finish has a slight sour/bitter touch to it. Not very alcoholic though. Decent brew overall, better than other pumpkin beers I've tried, although it could have had a little more of that flavor to it. I think I would try it again.","bennetj17","Aug 28, 2006"
3.66,-7.1,4,3,3.5,3,5,"Pours a golden, nearly completely clear, pumpkin-orange, with little to no foam. Very light carbonation. Smells of candy corns dipped in maple syrup. Most of the punkin in this beer comes out in the taste. To me, it tastes more like lager yeast than an ale yeast. Starts with a well-balanced, light malt sweetness and ends with everything on the label (pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg). Much more mellow, in a good way, from what I would expect from DFH. Smooth, light (maybe a little too light, believe it or not) and balanced mouthfeel. Definitely easy to drink. Unlike other pumpkin ales that Ive had, its not overwhelmed with pumpkin pie spice to a point where you cant finish a bottle. Pleasantly surprised, though not super excited.","bwyker","Aug 28, 2006"

Mouthfeel is good, light and bubbly. Aftertaste is very pronounced. It's sweet so I wouldn't want to drink a case of it in a row, but it's just an outrageously good beer when you're in the mood to enjoy something complex.

The taste is equally spicey and some really good pumpkin flavor but is it not overwhelming and doesn't taste like a slice of pumpkin pie, it tastes like a pumpkin beer and that is why I enjoy the DFH brew so much.

Thankfully, it's not that. The spices are light and easy. Ok, half way through the bottle I now get a whiff of pumpkin pie spice on the nose. But the flavor... It's awfully dry (and crisp) - which I find very surprising. Then there are these Thanksgiving spices floating around, and all, but there is an overwhelming sour note to it all. Is that the hops?

When I went into the liquor store, I didn’t expect to buy this beer, but it was on special and the price made it irresistible, given the rep of DFH. While I liked the beer and it was more than what I expected from a beer of this style, it’s not something I would want to drink very often.

Not overpowering though; I think the fruity alcohol helps the spice smell and taste less artificial. Lightly toasted malt flavors combine with sweet pears and pie crust. Spices, especially nutmeg and allspice throughout, and most notably toward the finish. Nice complexity and quite tasty. Medium bodied ale, with a relatively lively feel that helps fight any cloying or spiced-out tendencies. Light toasted malt in the finish and residual spicy sweetness and a maybe some orange peel/marmalade.

The taste is smooth and sweet with the pumpkin flavor taking a back seat to various spices. The sweet flavor is never overly dominant or too sweet. The carbonation adds a level or richness that exploits the spicy backbone.

Nose had really evolved to the point that the cinnamon and nutmeg stood out like a pair of sore thumbs! Spicy. Mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation was nothing like I had noted in its on-tap form. I liked this a bit better, actually. The taste was mellow, very spicy, but not as intense as it may have been. This really seemed to have aged well over the decade-plus. It took on a brandy-like quality that I found quite interesting. The label reads "7% Alc. by Vol.", but it was packing some heat. The spices really dried it out to the point that pumpkin and brown sugar were afterthoughts. It was bitingly dry and still slightly hot, reinforcing my brandy idea, but I may revise that to "sherry". Either way, it was different!","woodychandler","Dec 26, 2005"

Likewise, the slightly higher ABV (7%) helps cuts a lot of the potentially cloying sweetness created from the allspice, etc., resulting in a tasty seasonal ale.

Hops and alcohol are present in the finish; a nice compliment to the chewy malt. Finishes slightly dry, leaving you wanting more, provided you're into the kickass pumpkin ale you're imbibing.

It doesn't overwhelm the beer or add cloying sweetness. It mixes perfectly with hops and other beer flavors. Punkin has nice spices, a subtle sweetness, a fantastic smell, and an aftertaste that is complex and endlessly pleasurable. I love this beer. Its use of pumpkin is nuanced enough to allow this to be a session beer. Although it's seasonal, it could be sipped year-round.

The taste is balanced with real malts giving ground and imparting a sweetness that does very well with the nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. Very reminiscent of pumpkin pie. A nice pumpkin flavor lingers in the aftertase. Body is well carbonated, and drinks lightly. 7% alcohol is well concealed. It's easy to have more than one of these.

As for drinkability, I tried to have two in a row, and there is no doubt this one is at 7% ABV.

This pumpkin ale is sweeter and maltier than the only other I have for recent comparison, which is the Smuttynose Pumpkin. There are nice hints of allspice, clove, and maybe cinnamon. The beer also finishes quite dry with a very earthy pumpkin flavor. A Dogfish Head guy (owner, I think?) was at the bar, and gave a little summary of the beer, saying something about fermenting the natural sugars in the pumpkin flesh, which I would imagine contributes to this quality. Anyway, I thought this beer was highly drinkable for a pumpkin ale, and if I wasn't at the Blind Tiger with so many other brews to choose from, I could have knocked back a few more.

Just a touch of the malt on the back end. It has a medium mouthfeel. With the spice flavors, this would seem to be a great warmer.

The mouthfeel is kind of syrupy and sweet, with malt, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. It becomes overbearing at times. The finish retains the sweet character and is pumpkiny (?) and malty.

It's not as thick as the aroma suggests, the flavor is pretty strong but doesn't stick to your tongue, I wouldn't call the finish clean, but it doesn't hang around long either. It definitely leans more towards the pumpkin pie end with spices present. Loads of flavor and aroma are probably too much for half the beer drinkers out there.

Understated cinnamon and ripe fig esters as well. Very well rounded and appetizing aromawise. In flavor, a browned butter drizzled toasted biscuit impression is the dominant malt presence. Stately, slightly herbaceous allcpice and citric hop combination is an undertone. Lightly bittered, with balance skewed towards caramel, but sweetness never becomes cloying. Subtle bubblegum esters emerge as it breathes, helping facilitate a candyish overall suggestion. Well calculated and integrated pumpkin spice presence. Full dextrinous body and viscous, but not syrupy in mouthfeel. Finishes with soft alcohol warmth and brown sugar sweetness, lending a lingering spiced hot toddy impression. An excellent "pumpkin" ale, with judicious spicing and a simple malt backbone with girth. Very tasty and well crafted.","marc77","Dec 12, 2003"

As I mentioned in my Post Road review(before knowing about this), the Rodneys version was also based on a brown ale, which made for a more successful result. This beer really transcends its status as a seasonal novelty beer and becomes something Id be happy to have almost anytime. My one cavil is that it is too hoppy, which competes with the other flavors. Id prefer a slightly gentler British-style brown ale feel. To see if the hops mellow, I plan to put one away to age.

Flavors of pumpkin pie come to mind - as it should. Pumpkin and cinnamon dominate, as allspice, sugar and nutmeg offer a nice supporting touch.

The body is light-medium with a standard carbonation and a lightly zesty mouthfeel. The flavor shows the unique Dogfish Head character and starts with a good blending of sweet malt & spice, reveals a myriad of spice flavor as it crosses the palate, and finishes with a dry and peppery spiciness that lingers briefly. Bitterness is present, but plays a supporting role to the spice which acts as the main balancing agent (and dominant flavor). The spices are fresh and flavorful - much more so than the generic spicing usually found in pumpkin beers - and the beer has a very distinct character of its own which usually cannot be said of spiced beers. Very nice, and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Sep 26, 2002"
