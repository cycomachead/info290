I happened to come across a whole case of these in almost April and let's just say I'll b buying the whole thing. Anyone who likes weyerbacher pumpkin ale will love this it tastes similar but packs more of a punch.","MrWonka","Feb 13, 2015"

It has to be served at the correct temp, around 50 degrees or a little warmer to really bring out the the bourbon barrel aging, but does the aging ever pair with the pumpkin and spices.  Pumpkins are a style I can't generally abide, everyone has different tastes, but I enjoy bourbon barrel aged beers so when I saw this at the White Oak Tavern tonight, well I had to get a taste.  After a taste, I ordered a full 10 oz goblet and savored every drop.","MDHopster","Dec 01, 2014"

3.8,-2.6,,,,,,"Pours a deep dark orange in color. Sweet smells of vanilla,  Brown sugar, nutmeg, rum soaked raisins. The taste followed the nose closely albeit more subdued. The sweetness wasn't cloying. The beer is made to stand out in this concoction; the spices are just an accent. The taste of oak is slightly present in the taste also. The sharpness and burn of the alcohol is reminiscent of a brandy or bourbon and effective at breaking up the sweetness in this beer. Medium bodied, not overly bubbly. This would be an excellent beer to bottle condition for 2 years. Overall; I prefer this beer over Pumking because it isn't as sweet/ overly spiced. Recommended for pumpkin/yam beer lovers.","RexBanner","Oct 08, 2014"

Not usually a big fan of barrel aging, especially bourbon or whiskey (as this beer usually is) as the liquor usually takes over too much for my taste. Using the sweeter Rum, and already being a fan of pumpkin beer, it was the best thing I tasted at the festival. Been looking for a Rum aged beer for awhile and this was a great first impression of using Rum for a sweet sample of awesomeness.","Sound_Explorer","Jun 05, 2014"

This initially came across as quite booze and metallic, but as it warmed, those notes faded, allowing the beauty of the spice and the gourd to flourish. That said, the flavoring to follow lacked the punch that we’ve come to expect from these big, oaky pumpkin beers. The oak was actually great, and almost overly so because of how sour it was, but the pumpkin was rather flat. This is not to the fault of the brewer, but rather to the fault of the product itself, as it is inherently not very spicy or savory in its flavoring. There was, however, enough spice added to keep things interesting, and to meet the wood in full. This was a nice beer for sure, and we are glad to have had it fresh, while the bourbon barreling is in full season, but we suggest you wait a bit if you want a cooler, more buttery, and smooth-sipping beverage.","TheBrewo","Oct 24, 2013"

Pours fairly cloudy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, bourbon, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, pepper, clove, and pie crust. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of barrel, malt, and spice notes. Taste of caramel, pumpkin, brown sugar, bourbon, cinnamon, nutmeg, toffee, oak, vanilla, pepper, clove, and pie crust. Lingering notes of caramel, pumpkin, brown sugar, bourbon, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, oak, and pie crust on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of barrel/malt/spice flavors with some great complexity; and no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Barrel notes are a little strong, but it is still very well balanced. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a decent amount of warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice barrel aged pumpkin ale. Good balance and very nice complexity of barrel/malt/spice flavors; and fairly smooth to sip on.

I think the two go well together. I picked up a little vanilla in there too. The beer is a little creamier than the usual pumpkin beer, but it is a pleasant touch.","deg","Jan 05, 2013"

It has more of a kick yet still retains its pumpkin ale qualities (with this version actually having a somewhat stronger pumpkin flavor). The alcohol kick makes you wonder how it might taste with some age, though it's quite good fresh. It has many of the qualities of The Great Pumpkin in taste, and it's definitely a pumpkin, but here it's taken up a notch . The "aged in bourbon barrels" indicated on the bottle is definitely evident. Is it worth the several extra dollars in price over the original?

The bourbon for me overpowered the overall taste a little, and also had a bit of the "hot" quality. But as I said I do like my bourbon as well as my beer, and I like pumpkin too! I'd like to taste a little more pumpkin and maybe a little more spice (not more cloves though). That doesn't take away from the brilliant idea of pairing the taste of bourbon with pumpkin and spice, all in a beverage that can be enjoyed in more than one tiny sip at a time. Great job!

The retention was not very good but it did leave some streaks of lacing throughout the sample. The aroma was an appealing blend of pumpkin, spices, booze, caramel malt and hints of toasted nuts. The flavors were good and definitely put it amongst one of the best pumpkin beers I’ve had. It was doubtlessly boozy right from the beginning with notes of bourbon and vanilla but beyond that first wave was the pumpkin and spices one would expect followed by the subtle notes of caramel and butterscotch. I suspect this beer would age really well because I felt the strong booze notes were quashing some of the potential complexity. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium/full and the carbonation on-point. A “big” beer but a good one and exactly what I’d expect from Heavy Seas.","thekevlarkid","Jan 22, 2012"

The bourbon and pie spice meld into a beer equivalent of a rum fruitcake. I kinda wish I had waited till Thanksgiving to open this one. Nice malt backbone is backed up by firm earthy hops to close out the beer with a clean dry finish. Bourbon comes in to add some vanilla and oak.

The nose comprises bourbon, vanilla, light cocoa, honey, cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, caramel, and a touch of ruby red grapefruit rind in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and newcoming oak rocking the forefront of everything. More spices and a touch of toasted pumpkin seed back them up nicely. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, this is what a barrel-aged pumpkin beer oughta tste light. It brings in the best of both worlds and combines them very nicely.

Fairly sweet with vanilla and caramel blending in with the pumpkin spices. Oak aging gives it a strange twang, sort of like sour wood, but it adds a new dimension to the brew. Raw pumpkin sneaks in again towards the end of the sip along with some booze and lingers. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy with a moderate body to it. Nice carbonation going on.

The aroma is a mix of pumpkin (not overbearing), some caramel/sugary sweetness, cinnamon, spicy pepper, some bready dry malt and hints of bitter citric hop. First impression is real sweet and smooth, as a sweet pumpkin (along w/ sugar, caramel, and maybe vanilla) taste hovers over the spicy, alcoholic edge. This sweetness is thin, however, and there is a crisp, dry finish of spice and a touch of hops, plus a touch of that bourbon barrel (I think...might be power of suggestion).

Head gradually disperses into a creamy slick with some thin, but densely packed strands of lacing evident during the tasting. Nose expresses bourbon, a buttery quality, pumpkin spice aromas and a trace of citrus. Taste follows nose - pumpkin pie flavors dominate upfront; nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, followed by bourbon flavors that nicely integrate with the other elements. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to medium), with a lively carbonation, a slightly silky texture and some residual alcohol heat detectable at the finish. A very pleasant variation on the style and makes a great post-Thanksgiving digestif. That being said, 22oz. is perhaps a bit much.

Poured a very dark cloudy hazy orange with a somewhat small to medium sized white head. The head fairly quickly dissolved but somewhat stuck around till almost the end of the beer. Left hardly any lacing on the glass. The smell for me reminded me of a lot of bourbon barrel aged beers or at least had a familiar smell of that with the twist of a pumpkin ale. Had the bourbon, the vanilla from the oak, pumpkin and spices. The smell was very good. Taste was pretty much the same except I think the vanilla, bourbon, and the other taste from the barrel really stuck out with the pumpkin not totally in the background but still very upfront and well balanced. The pumpkin was there but not overpowering which I liked a lot. Went down really smooth, not very bitter at all actually kind of sweet. Mouthfeel was pretty average, nothing to rant or rave about. Drinkability was great. A mildly high ABV but very well hidden in my opinion. I could smell and taste the bourbon but it played no effect in making "hot" or undrinkable. I could have easily done another after finishing this one. Overall not the greatest pumpkin ale I've ever had but I'd put it up there. I was skeptical about a bourbon barrel aged pumpkin ale but it turns out it was quite wonderful, the bourbon and the oak barrel add great flavors to this beer. If I ever see this one again I will pick it up without hesitation. Great beer and great pumpkin ale.","dismal","Oct 30, 2010"

Pours a dark golden color, bordering on amber, with a good dirty white head on top. Aromas of bourbon initially, giving way to vanilla, cinnamon and a host of supporting pumpkin pie spices.

The nose is impressive in this pumpkin ale, showcasing a boatload of clove, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, all spice and brown sugar. The beer smells sweet and very spicy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet beer, though there's also something of a buttery mouthfeel and considerable alcohol as well. While I realize this is meant to be an "imperial" style ale, this beer comes across as an 11% or 12% abv. beer.... that's how boozy it is. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and almost slick in this low carbonation presentation, and the beer has a farily long, spice infused finish. As seems to be typical in these mutiny fleet beers, drinkability is not this beer's strong suit. The combination of sweetness, spice and in your face alcohol made it impossible for me to finish even the 10 ounce glass I was served at Mahaffey's.

The bourbon flavor is a bit stronger than the others, but the flavors all mesh well together. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has low carbonation.

I remember having the regular version last year and it wasn't bad. But these flavors just don't go well together. The mouthfeel isn't bad.

The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the first bourbon barrel aged pumpkin ale I've ever tried. It's unique and complex, but I prefer the regular version.","WesWes","Oct 08, 2010"

3.31,-15.1,4,3,3,4.5,3.5,"MF is thick, chewy, coating. Maybe a hair more carbonation to keep it moving but that's about it. OK drinkability, but I can't get past the buttery character of these beers. Maybe it's me--I'm pretty sure it's not the bottles since this is the same flavor I've found in two of their BA beers.","LordAdmNelson","Oct 06, 2010"
3.95,1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D- This is a very good, different pumpkin ale. The bourbon barrels add a different character-and certainly a big kick. This is clearly a strong pumkin ale that doesn't hide its booziness. Job well done by Clipper City here- one of my favorites from them.","PittBeerGirl","Oct 03, 2010"
4.95,26.9,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Poured a hazy orange with an unbelievable nose. If I could rate higher on the smell, I would. Pumpkin, peppermint, american oak come to mind. Taste was delish and mouthfeel was right on. Shared this with friends (poured 4 ways) and I wish I had the whole bottle to myself. I true jewel!","joshuacavett","Oct 01, 2010"
4.17,6.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Notes: The bourbon barrel notes were a nice touch to base pumpkin beer. I liked the lighter balance of spice here in The Greater Pumpkin Ale vs. the regular The Great Pumpkin Ale.","generallee","Oct 01, 2010"
3.9,0,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a style I just couldn't resist trying -- while it's got some flaws & I don't necessarily think the pumpkin is enough to support the bourbon barrel, it's enjoyable nonetheless. Definitely a sipper, & I can think of a handful of pumpkin ales I'd go to before this, but I'd be up for it again sometime for sure.","OneDropSoup","Oct 01, 2010"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D/M: Very thick and strong beer. Really should be enjoyed on a warm day with some strong food. Great carbonation and balance. I applaud the improvement with this version.","pzrhsau","Sep 30, 2010"
4.07,4.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"This one packs a punch and is clearly meant to be drunk in small portions, though it's tasty enough to forget this and down the whole bomber.","endincolorado","Sep 29, 2010"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange to light copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, bourbon, oak, and pumpkin spices. In the taste, mellow bourbon, oaky, and mellow pumpkin spice. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry bourbon to a clean aftertaste. Light bourbon probably due to the spice contrast. Nice warming feeling.","OWSLEY069","Sep 28, 2010"

3.7,-5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - I don't think age will do much more with this beer since after a while the sediment starts to set in destroying the flavor. Was really hoping for more with this beer but has really opened my eyes for big ABV Pumpkin ales. Most of them (Smashed Pumpkin, Hopping Frog Double Pumpkin, and this) were total booze bombs. I will stick with my Screaming Jack from Michigan. PASS!","DrDemento456","Sep 27, 2010"
3.55,-9,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Decent beer but a pumpkin ale? The bourbon shows through nicely but like the bourbon barley wine it's not necassarily the best bourbon out there at least the way it's aged. Ahh some hints of cinnamon and nutmeg with a butternut squash finish and a bit of oxidation on the finish as well. Some toffee malt oak and vanilla in the middle but not much else. Good but not what I was hoping.","mcallister","Sep 27, 2010"

3.53,-9.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Taste: this is where the beer gets lost to me. Just about all I taste is vanilla and oak. There is lingering spice in there, but it is way overshadowed by the oak and the whole beer gets steered off course. In other words, it totally flew over the seasonal runway. I could drink this in February and basically think of it as a strong ale brewed with spices and aged in oak. I then may have given it better scores because I wouldn't have been thinking "pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin"","weezyfart","Beers"
3.71,-4.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: This was better than the average pumpkin ale, but not amazing. The bourbon aging was a nice twist, and it seemed to work well with the other flavor elements. But the general quality and crispness of the brew was somewhat lacking. Nice body, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable, but a bit sloppy, so there was some missed potential.","Pencible","0"
4.27,9.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- High. I really like this beer, it won't be for everyone but I think the bourbon barrels work really well with the pumpkin ale base. I've bought a half-case of this already and will buy more if I see it. Good stuff.","ShogoKawada","Sep 26, 2010"
4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I was very impressed with this beer and even more impressed that the bourbon was as subtle as it was. A very well done beer that's well worth a shot, especially as the weather cools.","glid02","Sep 23, 2010"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"d - I actually liked this one more than The Great Pumpkin, though it isn't as much as a pumpkin beer. The spices and caramel malts that The Great Pumpkin had were kind of lost here due to the bourbon and oak, but a very enjoyable beer. Would have again.","mdfb79","Sep 22, 2010"

3.7,-5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I opted to go ahead and pour this one instead of aging it. The curiosity got to me. It poured a cloudy, murky dark burnt orange with almost no head at all. You can smell it from a couple feet away. You can pick up the pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon. Up close you get little more than bourbon, oak, and vanilla. The taste isn't what I wanted it to be. It's subtly pumpkin while overly bourbon. I would've liked it the other way around. It drinks slightly "hot" too because of the bourbon flavor paired with the 9% alcohol content. It has a medium to body and leaves the bourbon flavor on your palate. I like it, but it could've been better. I'll probably buy another one just to let it age for a couple years.","aasher","Sep 18, 2010"
3.26,-16.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"D: This is a very interesting experiment, however, I don't believe that this is a style that works as a barrel-ages concoction. When I go shop for a pumpkin ale, I want just that...a pumpkin-flavored ale.","Chaney","Sep 18, 2010"
3.7,-5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D: OK drinkability. The alcohol and cloves started to get annoying halfway through.","jnn4v","Sep 15, 2010"
3.25,-16.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a dark, dark brown with the slightest tan head. Smells slightly of bourbon and a little bit of pumpkin pie spice in the background. Neither seems to stand out. The taste ups the intensity a little bit, but not in a good way. The bourbon and pumpkin spices just don't really blend all that well in this version. The mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. No noticeable alcohol. Drinkability is pretty good for a beer of this heft, and I'll give it points for not having ridonkulous amounts of pumpkin spices, but that's about all I can say.","Thorpe429","Sep 11, 2010"
4.05,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Great smooth pumpkin flavor and spices just like the original but you pick up sweet bourbon flavors. It smooths the pumpkin spice out which I prefer..
