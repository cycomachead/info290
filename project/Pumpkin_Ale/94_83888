It definitely weighs more on the spiced side but I really enjoy how it seems to have sweeter notes of brown sugar as opposed to more potent hints of cinnamon. The flavors of clove, nutmeg and brown sugar give it a good body and finishes with a slight bit of pumpkin thrown in there. To me, its nothing too original but has respectable elements to it.","AyeMito","Aug 25, 2014"

3.5,4.2,,,,,,"my first pumpkin brew of the year this year, coming mid august, earlier every year but I am okay with that, and okay with this being the start of hopefully a long pumpkin ale season. its got a cool spice profile that's not super autumnal, more spice than squash, and a sort of lightness to it, maybe from honey rather than molasses. less raw, more refined. allspice and anise are there, and the pumpkin appears to be more roasted than raw. a nice orange rusty caramel color, a little haze to it, and a short and short lived tan head. it smells and tastes quite robust, but I don't find it overdone on the spices, and it has a real natural and organic sort of earthy feel to it, not artificially flavored at all. I find the body to be far thinner than I like in the style, maybe too light for cold weather, but it helps me drink it in this summer weather. carbonation is there but there is a missing middle to the feel and a strange tannic finish. mouthfeel would be its lowest score I think, if that feature were not just removed from this site. if it comes back I will update, if not, look elsewhere for a fuller bodied pumpkin ale.","StonedTrippin","Aug 14, 2014"

It's got a nice, even pumpkin aroma and flavor that's not overstated and is incredibly refreshing. Pumpkin doesn't dominate the palate like some other beers of this style tend to do, I'm thinking Shipyard Pumpkinhead and it doesn't taste like pumpkin pie. I've always been a fan of Long Trail beers and I was glad to see this in the fall mix pack. An excellent start to pumpkin beer season!","jaffers","Sep 14, 2013"

Considerably less pumpkin flavor and a harsh bitterness than wreaks havoc on the taste buds. I even tried increasing the sweetness by dipping the glass in cinnamon sugar. Did not help.
