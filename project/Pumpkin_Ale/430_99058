I didn't notice the ABV until I  tasted it. First thing I noticed was the alcohol. Then the second mouthful revealed complexity and as it warmed the flavors came through. Oak, vanilla and caramel balanced with pumpkin spices and just a touch of each makes a nice flavorful ale. I really wouldn't want stronger pumpkin spice flavors. This is very nice. I would buy this but a six will last awhile. Recommended.","hopmashian","Oct 27, 2014"

Delicious nose of pumpkin, clove, allspice, cherries, is reminiscent of the taste of pumpkin pie with a slight bit of cherry pie mixed in. Taste right away is vanilla, pumpkin, nutmeg, cherry, a light sweetness ties it together. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel. It's clear that this is a pumpkin beer from the spices however these are lightly applied to good effect mingling with a bit of vanilla and cherry element from the bourbon aging. No noticeable alcohol. Lightly sweet but a dry finish. Big fan of pumpkin beers as well as bourbons, and I really enjoyed this one.","JackieTH","Dec 12, 2013"

Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it tastes like pumpkin spices, pumpkin, bourbon, vanilla, and a bit of coconut. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's slick and smooth and goes down easy. The 10% ABV is well hidden in this brew. It's very similar to their regular Bourbon Barrel Ale, but with some pumpkin and spices. I think it's a good overall brew.
