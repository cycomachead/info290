The spices are not overpowering but add a delicate sensory experience.  The ale is sweet but not cloying.  The 9% ABV is not evident in either drink or aftertaste; instead, a slow heat rises in the stomach several minutes after consuming.  Just a darn good version of a pumpkin-based ale.","Ozzylizard","Sep 13, 2014"

The color is almost brown.  The smell is sweet with spics and grains. This brew does smell like pumpkin pie.  The taste is bold with flavor. You pick up on pumpkin spice and the richness. For being a brew with an ABV of 9.0% this brew goes down smooth.  There is no bad after taste of nothing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out 5. I will buy this brew again.

3.9,1.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/27/2013. Pours very hazy/cloudy deep reddish orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pumpkin, brown sugar, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of brown sugar, pumpkin, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of brown sugar, pumpkin, caramel, toast, biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt sweetness/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial pumpkin ale. All around good balance and complexity of malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 03, 2014"

The flavor is the most balanced I've ever tried for a pumpkin ale, full pumpkin flavor with a counterpoint of spice, neither one dominating, and then sweet malt. There aren't a lot of hops here, but enough to give the beer a clean finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied but not overly heavy (less so than Dogfish Head Punkin), with the alcohol very well hidden. I have never before had a pumpkin beer that so perfectly combines pumpkin, spice, ABV and drinkability.","HeightsEats","Sep 29, 2013"

Sweet pumpkin puree, sweet malt, with a some spices noticeable in aroma. Taste is similar, with an added buttery/creamy feel to it. Aroma and flavor improve as it warms. It's smooth, with a slight bite on the end, not terribly hoppy, but definitely rather substantive, or chewy, as they say. Excellent finish. Overall, not a bad pumpkin beer, I'd give this one another shot sometime for sure. I think I'd prefer a bit more hops, but this good. Cheers.","rodlavers","Beers"

You have to know what you're getting yourself into here--this is a pumpkin ale, yes, but it's a strong one. The smell consists of brown sugar and pumpkin, and in the taste is the pumpkin, alcohol (it's not hidden at all but actually compliments the other flavors), brown sugar, and butter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. I generally avoid beers with a very high ABV as I find that the alcohol can distract from the taste, but with this one I found that the beer went down very easy and tasted great. The pumpkin flavor is fresh and bold without being overbearing, and the beer manages to avoid the overly sweet taste that some pumpkin ales struggle with.","DeFaz","Sep 13, 2013"
