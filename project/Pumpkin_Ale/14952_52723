This beer tastes quite rich, with notes of vanilla, caramel, creme brûlée, and pumpkin pie. I also found the beer to have a strong alcohol taste and I thought it became a bit cloying as it warmed.  Overall, it's a solid pumpkin beer but could be refined a bit so that the sweet/alcohol flavors don't overpower the other, more subtle notes.","kellyej","Sep 21, 2014"

3.78,-9.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,"Being that it is intensely fresh, I went with a very heavy-handed pour, creating an initial pseudo-cascade which settled into two fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. Color was Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an oddly fruity quality, underlain by the spice, not the other way around, which is more standard. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was, interestingly, more sweet than spicy, more in keeping with what pumpkin pie tastes like and which the style was originally meant to mimic. I also liked that the spices were not overwhelmed by cinnamon, which can sometimes saturate this style of beer. Instead, the spices seemed to be more even and as such, more pleasant. Finish was dry, thanks to the spices, but not so dry and spicy as to be off-putting. I would say that this is probably one of the better examples of the style that I have tried.","woodychandler","Aug 06, 2014"

The aromas smell like a true pumpkin beer should smell like - not a pie or air freshener. You can smell the brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, baked apples and loads of pumpkin - almost like a pumpkin meat pie. I tasted cinnamon and brown sugar first. Its heavy sweetness puts the melting pot of spices in the right place. This is a beer to be enjoyed on a cold November evening. It is very balanced and goes down extremely smooth. It has a spicy aftertaste that leaves a smooth but sweet taste in your mouth. Many pumpkin beers are unbalanced - either too sweet or too spicy. This one is just right. Pumking is just a prince to this ale. Grab it when you find it if you like pumpkin ale. A 6 pack of bottles goes down very easy. Case is only $44.","uvachief","Nov 11, 2013"

It doesn't exactly stand out in the crowd, but this isn't a style with a deep range. There's a rich pumpkin pie spice aroma and initial flavor, followed by a slightly nutty, toffee malt character. The body is light enough to not let on the strength, I was surprised to learn it's 8%, so watch out for this one. Definitely worth a try if you can find it.

Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly cloudy sunset tawny topped by maybe a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg, light rye bread, clove, and brown sugar. The spices hang heavily, but not overbearingly. The taste brings in more of the same, but instead of the seeds the pumpkin's flesh is now evident, producing a strange (-ish) bitterness that undercuts the heavy spicing. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a pretty solid pumpkin beer, one that somehow manages to spice the hell out of it without o'erwhelming my 'buds in the process.","TMoney2591","Nov 05, 2011"

There is a slight sweetness to this offering, but it is nothing unpleasant by any means. There are also some apple notes as well (perhaps, this accounts for the sweetness). The sweetness combines nicely with a very light alcohol and spice finish.

4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at Pizza Paradiso in Old Town. Poured into a snifter glass. Pours hazy deep copper toward ruby with off-white head. Nose is rich caramel malt, pumpkin puree and spice, cinnamon, nutmeg. Tastes delicious; rich, sweet, complex, with a huge authentic pumpkin puree/spice flavor, even notes of pie crust, and a super smooth finish. Wow, this is one of my favorite pumpkin ales out there!","CuriousMonk","Oct 19, 2011"
4.56,9.1,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"All those spices rush in on the palate like a tribe in assault mode. Starts off big cinnamon and pumpkin spice, warps into a caramel malt sweet, and finishes mildly drying with a hint of nutmeg. This, along with Good Gourd from CCB are probably the best pumpkin beers I have had to date.","hoptualBrew","Oct 12, 2011"
4.22,1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear light copper with a silky off white head. Fades to a thin crown, little lacing or carbonation. Excellent strong, yet balanced aroma. Cider like with pumpkin mash, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Really enjoying the complexity of spice given the balance provided by the malt and pumpkin. Medium thick body, with an oily texture and a light syrupy finish. Flavor is sweet and has a surprising amount of pumpkin flavor. Nice to not just have a spice bomb. A very pleasant warmer, distinct from the other local suspects like Pumpking, Weyerbacher, etc.","yourefragile","Oct 08, 2011"

Easily the best Pumpkin Ale I have had, as this delectable brew allows the three great components to all shine in stride: pumpkin, pumpkin pie, and BEER. Too many beers of this ilk tend to shade towards sweet, sticky dessert types, losing many of the raw pumpkin and beer qualities. Not this one. It's thick, viscous, and perfectly balanced. Outstanding achievement.","siege06nd","Sep 30, 2011"
4.15,-0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic pumpkin ale; one of the best I've ever had behind Schlafly and ST's Pumking. Ton of nice cinnamon and gingerbread and super easy to drink, I would certainly buy this one again.","mdfb79","Sep 29, 2011"

Stumbling upon this brew makes me realize that I don't have to resort to Pumking as much for a solid pumpkin brew. This beer poured out with a nice amberish orange color with a light fizzy white head on top. There's really no lacing or anything but still looks pretty nice. The smell of this beer had some really nice autumn aromas and spice going on in it. The taste is unreal! I couldn't believe how good this tastes, the flavors even get better as it warms up. Plenty of sweet spices on tongue with a nice caramel in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is really nice also. Overall I can't believe how solid this beer is. It will be one I'll be on the look out for in the future for sure. I'll be lookin for more before this season is up! Really gotta try this one!","Knapp85","Sep 22, 2011"

Drinkable and repeatable. Would prefer a little more head retention to throw me that spice note on every sip.

Hints of multiple standard spice for the type like nutmeg and cinnamon, but its nice to actually smell pumpkin itself as well. Taste is spot on. Really does taste like pumpkin pie with a great blend of spice and pumpkin, and it doesn't feel "artificial" like in some pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is also really above average in this one. Its got a nice smooth feel in the carbonation that is not sticky or cloying like you can find in some spice bombs. Williamsburg has a top notch seasonal in this one that again seems to be flying under the radar for some reason.","smokeypeat","Sep 09, 2011"

3.55,-15.1,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Bright orange color, very opaque, glows in the light. Head is nonexistent. A vigorous pour generates a few bubbles, but nothing to speak of. Looks very still in the glass. Aromas are of pie spice and candy corn. Body is surprisingly light for the high abv, sweet but not too much. Pumpkin flavor is mellow with good spice and pie character, not overdone. Solid beer overall, but I think it was better a few months ago.","Tripphop","May 22, 2011"
4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Aroma was highly spiced but yet not overpowering as you see a lot with these pumpkins. They usually put too much of everything and try to force home the point of what it is, but this seemed to be very nice and subtle. It had a lighter overall smell then some, lots of nutmeg, and cinnamon and a good amount of fresh grass or even a tree like smell to it.This was followed by loads of fall spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, lots of spiced apple, just a good all around mix. There was a noticeable hoppy presence and this definitely could not be hidden. Great finish left you wanting another sip almost right away and there was just really an overall light and vibrant feel and flavor to this. Again very well put together. Super light but yet smooth at the same time. Very nice carbonation led itself to this and really helped to push the flavors out at you. This was full of the little carbonation bubbles if that makes any sense at all. It really made it feel silky like and had a great smoothness to it.","mikesgroove","Mar 22, 2011"

3.38,-19.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Reviewed on 1/10/2010. Bottle thanks to dkachur. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet pumpkin, pumpkin pie, crust, and spices. Flavor is pure pumpkin pie -- the pumpkin, crust, and even whipped cream on top. Pumpkin spices in the finish. On the sweet side and a little syrupy. It becomes a little cloying by the end of the glass but it's certainly a decent pumpkin ale.","LilBeerDoctor","Dec 23, 2010"

3.95,-5.5,4,4,4,4.5,3.5," The pumpkin in this is nice and not muted with a mild caramel malt backing and slight toasted taste with lighly sweet yet substantial malt flavor. The spiced middle is moderate and holds on to the end with creamy quality and subtle pepper w/ a hint of nutmeg. The vegetal flavor is there but kept to a minimum. This is a pretty tasty pumpkin, w/ good drinkabiity. A tad on the sweet side, but there is a nice amount of spice too. This style is one I might not drink often, but this is above average with very subtle alcohol for the abv.","Slatetank","Nov 03, 2010"

4.15,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a clear copper with a small head. As far as pumpkin ale aromas go, this one is on the extremely spicy, potpourri-like, end of the spectrum. If I were blindfolded and asked to smell it, I would not not be able to identify it as a beer. Normally I would consider this a major drawback, but in this case, the intense aromas of cinnamon, ginger, cloves, pumpkin, and brown sugar are so natural and enticing that I consider them an asset. The taste is almost like a highly spiced cider, like the mulled ciders we used to drink when the weather turned cold. The unabashed intensity of its holiday character draws me in and recalls family parties past. As far as pumpkin ales go, this is a love-it-or-hate-it beer, and I love it. Only complaint is that it's too sweet for anything but sipping very slowly.","droomyster","Sep 08, 2010"
4.22,1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. This beer is one of the best pumpkin beers I've had. Poured a full inch of head that dissipated within 30 seconds. Color is a medium brown with a bit of cloudiness that obscures anything behind the glass. Aroma is of spice, nuts, and bananas. The banana aroma seems to smell like a Belgian yeast, fruity esters. The spice and banana notes let this beer almost smell like fresh banana nut bread. Once you get into the taste of the beer, the pumpkin pulls through with a pleasant ghram cracker crust taste. Body is a bit weak for pumpkin pie, but it drinks really easily. I think this would pair very well with a good chocolate brownie or some vanilla bean ice cream.","neorunner","Sep 07, 2010"

We all really liked this, and it went perfectly with an early fall day and bocce ball. As a beer, it was very nice, medium body, not too much head but very pleasant. We purchased it for the pumpkin flavor though, and on that count it was the best I've had. The smell and flavor of pumpkin and spices was just right, definitely there, but not completely overwhelming the beer. It also did not have the artificial taste. If you are a fan of this flavor, and not everyone is, then grab a six pack of this and you won't be dissapointed.","LittleLeity","Sep 22, 2009"
