4.42,36.4,5,3,5,4.5,4.75,"This is, hands down, my favorite beer of all time. I encountered it a few years ago back home in Atlanta at a place called The Porter. It has a lovely blood red color and a pinkish foam that I've never seen in any other beer I've ever had. It has hints of apple, orange, and a floral print somewhere from what I tasted. At 6.66% ABV, it's a devilishly delightful drink. It's a little thin in your mouth, which doesn't really make a lot of sense considering the flavor you get. Also, the smell, doesn't really hit you as hard as I think it should, but those two things are minor compared to the beautiful flavor.","beernmetal","Apr 17, 2014"

Should it taste like an Octoberfest...well, on the label it says it's not that style...it's a Freaktoberfest beer. I'm OK with that. It seems like many reviewers take away because of the color, lack of imperial taste, or the like...might have been good to try this brew without seeing it's color, then rating it in comparison. This is an example of why I believe the appearance should be of much less significance than the aroma and, especially, the taste. The proof is in the pudding and even with probably a few more months of aging than is appropriate, this beer taste good, not imperially great, but I don't find anything significantly wrong and it has good body, flavors and tastes. Also great to pour at a blind tasting!!","DenverLogan","Jan 31, 2013"

Not really getting any fruit on the taste, maybe the color was fooling me. Anywho, interesting looking beer, very drinkable with a nice taste.","KickbacksSteve","Nov 06, 2012"

Subdued aroma of light biscuit malt, fruit and nonidentifiable vegetables. Flavor is bready malt, grassy hops, dark and light fruit finishing spicy with a sharp and somewhat acrid hop bitterness. An unusually flavored lager, but no identifiable ingredient for the oddness. Medium bodied. Odd, but certainly fun to drink, it lives up to its presentation and label art.

3.68,13.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating(but apparently from last year). Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Good spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of pear, apple, raisin, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, nuttiness, and light earthiness. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, raisin, toast, toffee, apple, molasses, biscuit, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, pear, raisin, toast, molasses, biscuit, earth, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; almost zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Oktoberfest style. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; very smooth to drink.

It definitely looks gimmicky, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I pick up some bready and some caramel malts in the aroma. There are some earthy and floral hops. There's some mild fruity aroma, which might explain the color. The taste definitely excites more than the nose as the hops come through pretty well. There are earthy, floral, and piney hop notes that are very forward. There is a solid bready and caramel malt backbone. There's some citrus and some mild cherry notes. The hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp with solid drinkability. This is a very good beer despite the gimmick.

The nose is sweet with notes of strawberry, pale fruit quality, but closes out with a musty veggie scent. Crisp mouth. Good carbonation, finishes clean. The musty character carries over to the flavor as there is a dank "old" flavor that pervades this beer. Flavors of beets, cherry medicine, mild fruits, touch of bitterness on the back end. This beer sure was an oddity. Not sure I would venture here again as I really didn't care for the medicinal quality of this one, but then again, it wasn't so horrendous that I wouldn't have it again if offered.

The taste focuses on the fruitier notes, including, in the back, a lingering mystery fruit that I just cannot put my finger on. This concoction, while not necessarily offensive, does not sit very well on my tongue. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish.

The aroma is very light with malts. The taste has some sour malts and maybe some fruit, but that could just be my eyes forcing a taste association.

Imagine my surprise (unsuspecting victim that I was since I bought the beer because the name seemed cool and I wanted to be daring with Shmaltz) when the pour was a candy apple red with a massive pick fizzy/foamy head. (I'm having flashbacks to Romulan Ale and Magic Hat Wacko, which are two of my most hated experiences in the last year.) Still, I'll give this one a shot. Aromas are fairly weak... a bit of dough, light brown sugar and some apple or fruit of some sort... it's hard, though, when your eyes are assaulted at every turn. Flavor is pretty non-eventful. A bit of an oktoberfest boozy graininess to it, some caramel and a funkiness that might be the dye or whatever. A tingly alcohol presence throughout.","CuriousMonk","Jan 27, 2011"

Pretty clear, a little haze and bubbles, but mostly clear. Smells faintly of some fruity hops, nothing is easy to pick out but I'd guess it's a pretty good mix of things. It tastes average, not my favorite red lager by a long shot but I think it's supposed to be different so I'll judge it on its own. It's got a sweet malty smooth finish that ends in a very quick bitter finish and an about 2 second aftertaste. It's different. Medium carbonation and light bodied. It's ok, I mean it's different. I thought going in it was an octoberfest, then saw it was a red/amber and don't really agree. It's unique.

Taste is sweet fruits with a good hop bitterness and a bit of red rope licorice - very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. This beer is actually very drinkable.

Earthy minty quality brings hops and dry bitter slightly sweet malt tones like an okotberfest with a bit more earthiness.

I have no idea how they got this color from just grain but I like it. This is a very sweet beer but not oversweet. It has flavors of grass and licorice. the mouthfeel is very light. I am not a very big fan of oktoberfest beers but this one definetly changed my mind.

Enters the mouth with some scattered hops that are quickly balanced by some woodsy mineral based malt. Really stays more on the skunky side although mellow German style of the brew.

There is no "red" flavor, there is no cherry flavor, dont let the appearance contort your judgement on this one, i drank most of it with my eyes closed because i was trying to pull apart the few lager subtleties when my brain was just thinking RED every time i'd inspect the beer.

I'm a big fan of IPA's that have grapefruit tastes from the hops, but this isn't really quite the same, probably because the malt bill is completely different.

I expected my first sip to taste like a) blood, b) cranberry juice, or c) something big and bold, but it was actually d) none of the above. It just tasted average, with a less than average mouth feel. Definitely not what I was expecting. If it was sold in 12 oz bottles, and could add it as a single in mix pack, I likely would, just for the sheer novelty of that color, but not in a bomber again.","tjbartjr","Sep 24, 2008"

2.52,-22.2,2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Okay, first of all, it's RED. Had this at Dive Bar on 96th St during the craft beer fest (though I was not on the crawl). Did I mention that it's red? It's the end of September and I'm thinking, "Oh, here is a play on a Maerzen." Not quite. In fact, not at all. It didn't remind me of an Oktoberfest at all. Apparently, Freaktoberfest is just freaky with out the fest. Hops and Alcohol on the front of both the nose and the tongue. Reminded me more of a malt beverage (e.g. cooler) than a beer.","Maerzen","Sep 21, 2008"

3.65,12.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22oz. bomber served in a pilsner glass. Poured an unnatural looking deep red with a finger of pink head. Fairly hoppy aroma, with a little fruit and a fair amount of caramel malt. Nice malty base. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Bit of a hop bite. I didn't taste any red fruit, so the color must be artificial. Kind of fun to drink, but nothing earth shattering. I wouldn't call it an Oktoberfest.","homebrewhawk","Sep 21, 2008"

3.08,-4.9,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Rather bizarre beer, indeed; certainly a Halloween novelty. Poured red. That's RED, like Red40 cherry soda dye red. I'd like to know how they achieved this. The colour is very, well, off-putting. Not that it's disturbing or anything, it just isn't "normal" to see a beer that looks like this, and my brain and tongue had a rather challenging time making the correlation. The smell was very modest and only after agitating what was left in the bomber that wouldn't fit into the pint glass on the first go-'round, was I able to detect anything worth mentioning. Even at that, it was only a mild sense of lightly toasted cereals and a tiny bit of fresh fruit. The taste really surprised me in that there was an imediate hop bitterness (okay, it was moderate at best, but hey, there were hops there!) followed by a mild mat character, then the hops again. Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say here. There are scores and scores of better beers out there. The point I'm trying to make it this: The smell and appearance had me highly doubtful of there being any quality in the flavour of this beer. To my surprise, it was much better than I was expecting. I'm certainly glad I tried this one out, but I don't know if I'll purchase it again. Bizarre to say the least.","SilentSabre","Sep 20, 2008"

2.89,-10.8,2,3,3,3.5,2.5,"The shocking red appearance was enough to make me yell "what the hell is this", but that was nothing compared to the pink foam forming above the body. Alright, now that I was done with this part of the review, I could turn off the lights so that I could get myself to drink this. The smell was not quite as weird as the looks, but the cooked vegetable matter hidden under the hops made this somewhat unappealing in that regard as well. The taste was a decent blend of hops and malts, but felt a little bland. The aftertaste was initially metallic, but improved as the beer warmed up. The beer felt pretty good in the mouth with a medium thick but sticky palette. This did not turn out to be the drain pour that I was afraid it might be, after I first laid my eyes on it.","rajendra82","Sep 18, 2008"
