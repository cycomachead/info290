2.94,-14.3,4.25,2.75,2.75,3.25,3,"I have been drinking Cisco's beers since they started, but I had yet to try their pumpkin ale.  On the pour everything looked great: rich amber color, really nice head, off-white in color, with fine lacing.  The pumpkin aroma was very slight, and so, alas, was the taste, which was mostly a hoppy bitterness.  I could only make out a little pumpkin flavor, and no spices whatsoever, as the bitterness overwhelmed.  If you want your pumpkin ale to taste more like a pale ale, this is for you. But if I get a pumpkin ale I want to taste the pumpkin, and this beer didn't hold it's own in that regard.","rorjets","Dec 23, 2014"

I'm wondering if there is a hop presence that may have been more noticeable closer to the canning date. Next season I'll seek this one out closer to the canning date to see if the hops are more of a factor. Easy drinking Pumpkin Ale, worth a shot.","Hendry","Nov 09, 2014"

I've been drinking craft beer whenever i can find it and found this at a grocery store near me that sells mixed 6 packs where you can choose them. This was the last one I picked out since I hadn't had it before. It was in a can, not a bottle - so maybe this contributed to the flavor of the beer - or got a bad banch of it. When i first smelled it - it smelled like it had skunked or been sour, but tasted it and it tasted just plain horrible. The pumpkin spice that its advertised as being a "pumpkin beer" was missing, and tasted very, very watered down. This was the second time I've ever poured out a beer - after my horrible experience with a 3 year old can of Narragansett Bock...it tasted almost just like that. Perhaps it wasn't fresh - or in a can like I said (I've had Cisco's Whale Tale, and Grey Lady and they're alright) but I will have to follow this up sometime in another form. I do not recommend!","joncob","Sep 19, 2014"

The malt takes a back seat but still supports the rest of the flavor profile adding some sweetness to the spice and yeast which is pretty seamless.

Gourdy goodness with some actual vegetal pumpkin aromatics here. Refreshing quaffable pumpkin ale, not overly spiced but there's a great base beer underneath the pumpkin pie spice.

Nothing offensive, to be sure, but nothing overly special: some coriander, very faint pumpkin, orange peel. The taste is much more intense. For me and my preferences, this is a good tasting pumpkin spiced ale in that there's a heavier emphasis on the spice flavors and not on the pumpkin. So it's not like you're quaffing some beer out of a hollowed-out orange squash, but rather the spices and other ingredients used remind me of autumn: mulling spices, fresh ginger-snap cookies made with molasses, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, allspice, corn, candied citrus. A lighter-bodies beer, and for me a bit too much carbonation.","kaufmaal","Sep 14, 2013"

The nose comprises caramel, light graham cracker, brown sugar, clove, a pinch of cinnamon, and toast. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger toast component, this time almost seeming like toasted pumpkin seeds. For once, the spicing in a pumpkin ale is present but restrained, a welcome change, even for a sweet-toothed spice-hound like myself. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a solid enough pumpkin ale, one that tones down the spices compared to others while maintaining a healthy balance with the underlying malts.","TMoney2591","Aug 27, 2013"

The taste has a spicy hop flavor to it with some pumpkin spices coming through on the middle of the tongue. I get a slight pumpkin flavor but more malt on the back of the tonuge. The mouth feel is good smooth, a little more heavier than other pumpkins but good. Overall this is good but needs less spice and hops and more pumpkin.","chefhatt","Oct 25, 2012"

The smell and taste is quite gingery- and lacks a lot of the other pumpkin pie spices, and is also quite a bit thinner than I'd like. There is a chalkiness to the brew as well, as though raw spices were just dumped in. Completely lacks the silkiness of the pumpkin- either it wasn't used or not enough was, or perhaps the raw spices just overwhelm it. The spices leave a bit of a bitter taste in the mouth, but the ginger note is pretty tasty nevertheless. Needs more balance, or at least more integration.","Georgiabeer","Oct 18, 2012"

As the beer moves towards the back of the tongue the spice notes get heavier, and the beer has a light, smooth body that starts creamy and then finishes crisply due to the spicing.

3.8,10.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, not bad. Not the best, and a far cry from the worst pumpkin beer out there (and there are a few). The beer is built to be sipped, and the unique flavor is built into the finish. Some will bitch that this is not enough. It pretty much works, though. This is not a brew where the additional spice et al will stand up to food. You'll get the malt, but the rest will disappear. Worth a try as a change in the autumn beer menu.","OtherShoe2","Oct 01, 2011"

Not enough hopping, not enough flavor. Pumpkin ales in my opinion should add more flavor complexity to what is already a good brown ale. This one just didn't seem to be on that level. Not a good brown ale, not a good pumpkin ale.","alpinebryant","Sep 28, 2011"
2.71,-21,4,3,2.5,3.5,2,"Overall: A real let down of a beer. Doesn't work as a pumpkin beer, but doesn't seem to want to be anything else either. I like my pumpkin beers subtly spiced, but "subtle" would be a real euphemism for this beer.","Pahn","Sep 28, 2011"

3.57,4.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Coppery apricot colored with a sizzly white head that settles out slowly. Aroma of pumpkin and squashy vegetal notes, plus understated spice. Flavors of pumpkin and squash upfront, some bready malt, followed by subtle spices, thankfully easy on the nutmeg. Punctuated with a spicy and herbal bitter finish, a bit peppery, and a decidedly unpleasant acrid note that lingers and detracts from the whole. Moderate carbonation, even mouthfeel, a bit average overall for me mainly because of the lingering acridness.","far333","Sep 20, 2011"

3.75,9.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy caramel color with a thin off-white head without much retention of lacing. The nose brings a bit of caramel and actual pumpkin, though not too much on the spice front, which was nice. The flavor had some nice pumpkin puree character without the heavy spicing behind many in this style. Slightly chewy with a medium body. Pretty good.","Thorpe429","Sep 15, 2011"

Also has a bit of a metallic flavor which is unfortunate. The price, combined with the mild flavor and the metal makes this a slightly below-average Pump in my book.","VelvetExtract","Sep 04, 2011"

3.32,-3.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Made a trip to where this gets brewed today and grabbed a bottle straight off the line. Clear and a burnt copper color. Small amount of head but left a thin lacing. Spicy nose with a lot of nutmeg shining through more than anything else. Flavor is toasty malts and the nutmeg and cinnamon. Close to a pumpkin pie. It has that sweet bread but is also spiced evenly. Nutmeg is again the dominate spice but everything is balanced like a good pie. Finishes without cloying at first but towards the end of the glass I'm starting to think I'm down with just the one bottle. Good beer but only for that one glass. Not a beer I'm going to drink a sixer of at a autumn bonfire.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 15, 2011"

4,16.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice dark peach with a 1 finger off white head. Head lasted a few minutes before leaving a thin layer that clung to the sides nicely. Aroma was slightly sweet, with definite pumpkin aromas and hints of spice. Taste was smooth and fruity. It finished off with a peppery spiciness in the mouth. Occasional hops bitterness showed through. Very well balanced and nicely seasoned. Felt decent in the mouth, coated well and nicely carbonated. Slight overcarbonation occasionally lingered in the back of the mouth, but not enough to detract. Very good to drink, could go either as sipper or as a drinker.","mountdew1","Jan 31, 2011"

4.25,23.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Another somewhat early seasonal opportunity on tap at the brewery in Nantucket this week, this tasty brew shows a muddy dark chestnut brown with plenty of light tan head that fades to a wispy topping with lots of lacing. The aroma is a bitter swamp thing with vegetable malt and herbal hop evident. Very edible and intriguing. The flavor sticks to that theme which I love. Pumpkin is present but it's not precisely the dominant idea here. There's a malted milk and cinnamon flavor that mixes perfectly with the subtle pumpkin and finishes with the dry hoppy goodness of the advertised Nelson hops. Alcohol is not really notable but it upholds an ale idea and offers a beautifully mellow and dry, resinous, yet somewhat creamy feel. I get all sorts of vegetable hints with sweet malt blending in tastefully. It's medium bodied and unusually well carbonated for a cask. Drinkable enough by my tastes. What a great surprise at the Cisco Brewery.","Durge","Sep 21, 2010"

Not sure where the bitter comes from. As it warms the bitter fades and the beer mellows becomes more malty with some more spice overtones. Not a bad Pumpkin ale, but nothing spectactular.","Liverpool08","Sep 16, 2010"

It's only real downfall is the sheer lack of carbonation. However, I'll have to buy one (as I was planning to do anyways) and verify it has carbonation and I'll add on to this review.

3.78,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I've had this on tap at the brewery and now in the bottle. I think on tap is a bit better in that the nuances of the spices emerge better. The beer has more of a foamy head, a foamed up mouthfeel, and a bit more lacing in the bottle version. The nose is surprisingly light on the pumpkin aromas, heavier on the malty caramels. There are more drying leafy hop notes in the bottle version as well. I'm knocking down the bottle version just a bit. It's a nice pumpkin ale, but it just doesn't have the full palate or the character of the on tap version.","albern","Oct 09, 2009"
4.2,22.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. About a finger and a half of an off white pillowy head. Head retention is good with a good amount of lacing left behind. There is a wonderfully strong, inviting nose to this beer. Most easily picked out is cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is fantastic! The cinnamon and nutmeg once again dominate the flavor but here is where the pumpkin comes in. Pumpkin flavoring mellows out the spices to give this beer a nice blend of flavor bursts with a mellow finish. Decent carbonation and a smooth feel make this beer once that I could sit with all night.","Jayli","Feb 14, 2009"

Lots of pumpkin pie spice in the nose, doughy, and some full-on meaty pumpkin flesh aroma. This is the goods! Lots of nutmeg and spice flavors, pumpkin pie (crust included!), and actually more robust and bitter than overly-sweet. Delicious!
