Very dark brown, murky, decent light brown head with tiny bubbles.  Sips leave a good amount of lace on the sides.  Nearly opaque dark brown with hints of ruby, one-finger dense tan head and modest lace. Bitter at the start, with a sweet, caramelly finish.  I find the sweet almost too much.  Hint of sour from the pumpkin. Medium body, not as thick as I would expect, slight carbonation, long finish.  Overall, I liked it but if I made one change it would be to tone down the sweetness a little.  I think it was a bit less sweet last year.","PacNWDad","Oct 18, 2014"

Flavor brings some additional smoky notes, and the website it says they use malt smoked with alder wood to achieve that. Also spice, dominantly cinnamon, but I can't say I notice any actual pumpkin. Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, and almost too sweet, especially if you let it warm too much. I would've liked less sweetness and obviously more pumpkin for a pumpkin ale, however I actually think it tastes good, really bold flavors, just no pumpkin. And is it even a porter? Honestly think it's closer to some abbey ales I've had than to a porter. Good stuff for a non-pumpkin abbey ale pumpkin porter.","BeerWizard","Sep 17, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, a little prickly, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but i think one would be my limit, since I think the mouthfeel would start to wear on me after having more than one.  What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, it was just were it needed to be and no aspect was too overpowering.  What I like the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was this beers weakest point and it needs some work.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to any pumpkin beer fans.  All in all I enjoyed this beer, but I thought the mouthfeel just made it a little rough around the edges, but other than that it was a nice beer.  This is now my favorite beer from this brewery and I think it's up there as a nice Pumpkin Ale.  Good job guys, this was a nice beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Sep 12, 2014"
3.68,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/14/2015. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and herbal/spice earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, toast, caramel, brown sugar, biscuit, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and herbal/spice earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, light coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pumpkin porter. Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, pumpkin, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. I felt like the malt flavors should have been a bit more robust at 7%, but it was nicely enjoyable otherwise.","superspak","Sep 12, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, pumpkin pie spice, and slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy pumpkin and slight spice flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a spice presence that is fairly subdued all around.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 05, 2014"

Aroma of sweet toasted malt, chocolate, light pumpkin and pie spices. Flavor is light toasted malt, brown sugar, pumpkin and pie spicing, finishes with light chocolate and a hint of hops. Light to medium bodied, somewhat light for a porter. A nice combination of dark malts and pumpkin, with nicely handled spices, but a bit light in flavor and finishes with a whisper of flavor.

Those looking for the biggest baddest boldest (as I often do) might not agree, but I think they kind of threaded a needle using a fairly straightforward recipe, aside from the pumpkin, and achieving some really nice balance and synergy from the ingredients. I think it coulda been a flop. But they got it right. Pretty sure they did some smaller practice batches before turning this loose. ... Upon reading my praise please note that I have no problem pummeling AK Brewing with fairly harsh criticism when I feel it is deserved. They are the closest large craft brewery to me and I have often complained that they are too tame (with some exceptions). But with this one the tame worked, and I think there is some skill in the brew room facilitating this success.","sprucetip","Oct 21, 2013"

I absolutely adore that feature, its unique and it makes this a hit immediately. the pumpkin is there, cloaked in rich chocolate malt and a gentle but detectable spicing. its got an almost chalky feel, not quite so dry, but a little gritty on the palate, nice for autumn. its pretty steady drinking, but the buzz comes on a little harder than most beers around 7% abv for some reason. fuller bodied, it could use another notch of carbonation, but I almost like it a little still. the whole pilot series from Alaskan has been wonderful, and this is one of the best beers in it. a must try for pumpkin lovers.","StonedTrippin","Oct 18, 2013"

It was definitely a good porter, but it didn't have any spicy notes I was expecting, nor the sweetness I was expecting from something that claimed to be flavoured with brown sugar. The flavour was mostly that of a typical porter. It had coffee and cocoa notes, a moderate sweetness. It was on the thin side, but that's typical in America where beers labeled as porters tend to be slightly thinner than those labeled as stouts. Despite this thinness, the "pumpkinness" in the brew seemed to primarily serve as a fortification of the yeast character. It gave sort of a false impression of a thicker beer than it actually was. The yeast and hint of pumpkin flavour came together very well in this sense. I also wasn't overwhelmed at all by the bitterness of roasted malt or cocoa flavour. This might have been where the brown sugar came in. It didn't taste especially sweet, but there may have been some sugar at play to fight off excessive bitterness. It was definitely a good all-around porter, but there was nothing pumpkiny about it up front. Not the sweet, pumkin-pie flavour I was expecting. The brown sugar advertised was barely noticeable. So, if you want to enjoy it, drink it when you're craving a good, hearty porter, not when you want a sweet, pumpkin pie treat. There wasn't even much in the way of pumpkin-style spices. Cocoa and coffee flavours dominated.","ElCommodoro","Oct 05, 2013"
