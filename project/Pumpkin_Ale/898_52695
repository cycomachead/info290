3.62,-4.2,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Very clear, dark pumpkin colored. Like a dusky fall orange. White head is thick with great retention and lacing. Clumps are sliding down the glass and sticking to the sides. Active carbonation is evident as the glass sits and with each swallow. Smell is a mix of biscuit malt and pumpkin meat. Toasted multigrain bread and light butterscotch. Pumpkin pie spice is showing along with a sweet alcohol note. Taste is sweet and alcoholic with a firm bitterness in the finish. Malted caramel sweetness in the front with a Maris Otter malt biscuit and toast flavor. Pumpkin pie sits on top of the caramel and tries to cover the alcohol but it just can't a as the flex is too bold. Firm bitterness rides in on the last of the booze and leaves an herbal and slightly minty finish. Slight metallic mineral edge along with other flavors give this an overall English character with an imperial pumpkin edge. Feel is slightly heavy with a light syrup consistency. Carbonation is smooth and very well done, making this sipper of an ale quite easy drinking. A solid imperial pumpkin that while a not a quaffer goes down easily. Temperature is very important with this one. The flavors develop and unify as it warms to English pub temp. Much better flavor cool than cold.","scootny","Jan 04, 2013"

To be honest, I think it’s the absence of spice intensity that makes this one the best; I mean, we all know pumpkin pie has those spices to it, but if I ever tasted a pie that was as super-spiced as some of these beers have been, I wouldn’t go back for a second bite. Once again, balance wins.","BarryMFBurton","Oct 19, 2012"

At first pour it is as orange as orange gets and really does set you in the mood for the season. The aroma coming out of my glass a full two or three feet from my face was enough that I could smell it and was delighted by it. The taste is purely pumpkin and strong which is a nice change from the more weaker pumpkin flavored ales on the market. Ive been typing for a few minutes now and I can STILL taste it on my tongue. The mouthfeel was a bit more carbonated than I like, too much like soda, but still pleasant. Overall this is absolutely a must have for Pumpkin Ales and anyone who enjoys the style.

Clove and nutmeg (?) come in strong in the latter half of the palate, upon the wave of sweet, pie-y malt. Cinnamon shows up in the finish, along with lingering spices, vegetal bitterness and leftover malt sweetness. Medium-full body with a slightly creamy feel.

Aromas of smoke and roasted pumpkin on the nose, with a very light spicing and some wheat characteristics. Flavors are round and smooth, with a slightly sour tang on the tail end. The bulk of the flavor profile is a light, smooth pumpkin and spice balance, which is mostly cinnamon, and the overall flavor comes off like a batch of pumpkin cookies. The aftertaste is sugary sweet, but short-lived. The abruptness of the aftertaste keeps it from being overpowering or cloying. A candied finish, both quick and sweet. Tasty beer, and with all the sweet profile, it would make a tasty dessert beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 23, 2011"

Poured orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pumpkin, brown sugar, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, alcohol, brown sugar, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This was not overly complex which left me wishing and hoping for more. This was okay though as the flavors that were there were just right in intensity.

3.2,-15.3,4,4,2.5,4,3,"Overall I thought this was an Ok Pumpkin Ale. I like my pumpkin ales to have a noticeable pumpkin flavor and not dominated by spices, and in this beer the spices were just too dominating and didn't let much pumpkin or malt flavor shine through. The heavy spices and slightly warming alcohol don't make this beer too drinkable, I am glad I am splitting this bomber with my brother or else this might be a chore to finish. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it seems to have ok balance in the aroma and it was similar to pumpkin pie. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, there was just too much spices and too little malts and pumpkin. I don't think I would get this beer again when in need for a Pumpkin Ale, Screaming Pumpkin is cheaper, more balanced, and tastes better. If you love Pumpkin Ales you may want to give it a try but expect it to be spice forward. This wasn't a bad beer it just lacked the balance that I look for the most in this style, Screaming Pumpkin from the Michigan Brewing Company is still my favorite Pumpkin Ale, but I would still take this over Samuel Adams Harvest Pumpkin Ale and I would like to try The Greater Pumpkin if I see it around, maybe barrel aging is just what this beer needs. My least favorite beer from The Mutiny Fleet so far, but Peg Leg is still my least favorite beer from them.","StoutHunter","Oct 22, 2011"

The taste is mostly like the aroma, the pumpkin pie spice flavors are dominant, but there is some pumpkin and a bit of booze noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick and has moderate/high carbonation. I think it's a decent enough pumpkin beer, but it's not one of my favorites.

There is a strong bitterness on the finish from a combination of hops, alcohol & spice. The mouth feel is smooth and Medium Body.

Big malt background on this beer, and that saves it for me. Not over the top, just about right. Feel isn't complex enough for me, and a little thin.

The smell is dominated by spice with the typical cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg with a bit of hop and a touch of malt in there as well. Overall the smell is nice it is clear that this is a pumpkin ale. To me the spicing seems a bit overdone in the taste. Maybe it's just due to the fact that this is my first pumpkin beer of the season and I'm not used to these flavors yet but this one seems a bit over the top especially on the first sip. So the spicing dominates yet beyond that is a good balance of crystal malt and enough bitterness to almost rein in the spice. As it warms the spice fades a bit. I do have to give credit where it's due in that this beer doesn't come off as overly sweet and may appeal to those who like an assertively spiced beer. The mouthfeel is good but to me again a bit too much spice makes it feel overly busy and the finish is like a spoonful of pumpkin pie spices.

The general mouthfeel here is a BIG Spicy one with an emphasis on the cinnamon, burnt sugar, and pumpkin spice. At first sips, the taste walks the line of being just a bit too "Fall spiced," but then it soon makes friends with my palate as the drink goes on. A Mutiny truly does take place and there's a good malt balance for smooth sailing on a big pumpkin sea. You could call this "Pumpkin Ale on steroids" or you could call it "Imperial", which it truly is...Pumpkin Ale lovers who just can't get enough flavor should try this...

The finish is fairly dry, but there is some lingering notes of sweetness, with some spices. No bitterness noticed, but it fits this style perfectly. Alcohol was very well hidden, only a very small warming after the finish noticed. Quite drinkable because of the good flavor, and very smooth going down. Medium carbonation and body.

Small streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Aroma was a creamy pumpkin pie, very lightly spiced, reminded me of a pumpkin eggnog. Flavor was more spices than pumpkin, but had some creaminess to it. Occasionally picked up a slight taste of bitterness, but not pronounced. Felt like a barleywine or old ale in the mouth, slightly sticky, coated well. Very pleasant to drink, not necessarily as a pumpkin ale, but as a solid beer.","mountdew1","Oct 31, 2010"

3.33,-11.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D- Even though it was a little sweeter than expected, this beer was fairly well balanced...hits on all the right notes, but just isn't exceptional...a solid brew that is worth a try, but probably not a revisit...","Goldopelgt","Oct 17, 2009"
3.35,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Beer is bitter, sharp and spicy. Hard to drink. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin beers but this one has a warming alcohol flavor that thins out the mouthfeel. Drinkability low due to odd bitterness on the back end. Not a repeat but you pumpkinheads may like it.","drabmuh","Oct 16, 2009"
3.9,3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Not a bad Pumpkin Ale overall, but the alcohol lowers the drinakability a little. The spices are also on the high end.","BeerSox","Oct 16, 2009"
4.02,6.3,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"I think this beer captures quite well the essence of a pumpkin beer. I've had many this season, and this one seems to stand out...it's well-balanced, spiced, and works well across the palate. Aside from Southern Tier's "Pumking," this is one of the best.","movingtrain","Oct 16, 2009"
3.9,3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a pretty solid beer, but is not so exceptional or different from other pumpkin ales out on the market that I can see any reason to seek it out. The one glass I had the other evening will likely be the only one I order this season.","John_M","Oct 15, 2009"
4.02,6.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"In my tulip glass, the beer was a hazy dark orange with a thin white head. Pleasant aroma of pumpkin and spice. The aroma translated into a stronger taste of pumpkin and pumpkin spice. A bit of warming alcohol, not intrusive. I felt like I was drinking a liquid pumpkin pie. Very smooth, great pumpkin beer.","lordofthewiens","Oct 14, 2009"
4.15,9.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Despite the mouthfeel, this is a decent example of the style. It seems to me that whenever pumpkin beers ramp up the alcohol, the taste gets ramped up as well. You can't go wrong with trying this but Pumking is where it's at.","Brad007","Oct 14, 2009"
3.35,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"I appreciate the idea...we need more Imperial Pumpkins like Pumking, but this one doesn't quite meet my expectations.","Ezekiel81923","Oct 12, 2009"
3.61,-4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Although this isn't my favorite imperial pumpkin ale, the subtler flavors do enhance the drinkability of the beer. I probably wouldn't return to this one, but I'm glad I had an opportunity to try it.","kurp001","Oct 12, 2009"

3.8,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours from the 22oz. bomber bottle a medium amber-is color with a half finger head that quickly dissolved into a light lacing. I see almost ZERO carbonation going on, I can practically count the bubbles on one hand. The aroma is malty and slightly sweet, with hints of pumpkin pie spices and maybe just a hint of brown sugar. 1st sip brings a strong hint of pumpkin (yes, you can actually taste the pumpkin), malt, and spices. There is a strong bitterness on the finish from a combination or hops, alcohol & spice. The mouth feel is smooth and neither heavy or watery. Drinkability is pretty good...I could see myself downing a few of these on a Saturday or Sunday while watching football. Overall, a very good beer, IMHO. A nice take on a style that seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it type of beer. I, for one, love it!","CJfromPhilly","Oct 07, 2009"
3.06,-19,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,2,"Final thoughts: Yep, it's a pumpkin beer alright. Some toasty pumpkin flavor, light on the spices, but ridiculously sweet! Then the long nagging sweet pumpkin flavor that turns somewhat bitter and won't go away takes a lot from the drinkability. Also, did I mention its way too sweet! It's got a nice alcohol taste, warmth, and slight burn with is unusual for a pumpkin beer, but, you know, the sweetness. Don't think I could stomach this again. If it were, say, 1/10 the sweetness I might be able to attempt this again.","jlindros","Oct 07, 2009"
3.77,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D - Pretty solid for 8%. The alcohol is barely noticeable behind all the spices. One of the best pumpkin ales I've had, this one will make a great fall beer.","dpasotti","Oct 06, 2009"
3.84,1.6,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"This beer doesn't take the style to the next level, but it sure doesn't do it a disservice. I really like it and will check it out during the future fall seasons.","BB1313","Oct 06, 2009"
3.58,-5.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"d: a nice enough pumpkin, but it suffers in the complexity department - lacking in pumpkin flavor and not totally balancing the spice, alcohol isn't an issue","blackie","Oct 01, 2009"
3.58,-5.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a nice deep clear amber color with a one finger of off white sudsy head that recedes relatively quickly. Minimal spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is spicey - nutmeg and cinnamon dominate, some pumpkin and malts filter in as well. Taste is similar to the other pumpkin ales that are heavy on the spice/pumpkin pie aspect, though this one seems a bit off balance. Spices seem to fight the pumpkin flavoring rather than compliment them. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate the flavor with pumpkin and malts trying to fight through. Lighter side of medium bodied, mild carbonation, thick and chewy feel to the body. This was a decent brew, but I've had better offerings of the style.","Jayli","Oct 01, 2009"
4,5.8,4,4,4.5,3,3.5,"Drinkabilty: Although I'm fairly new to these "Imperial Pumpkin" brews, I like this showing from Clipper City. The spiciness really sets this apart from any other pumpkin on the shelf. Although this may be it's downfall, since it has alot more of a spice feature then a pumpkin taste. Otherwise, you still get a good pumpkin backdrop and you still get a 8% brew thats decently drinkable and loaded with interesting qualities. I liked this way more then their Imperial Octoberfest and will definetley have a few more of these as the fall continues on!","thespaceman","Sep 27, 2009"
3.9,3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"A solid pumpkin that I really enjoyed the more I had, but I would not rate it on par with the top dogs. Still a solid beer that I would drink in the fall. I enjoyed the imperial part with the higher abv. Nice.","Kadonny","Beers"
4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Nice medium body with lots of pumpkin pie spice. Pretty malty for the style with a lot of pumpkin flavor, cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, ginger and nutmeg. The spiciness is pretty prominent but doesn't overpower the pumpkin lasting into a dry finish . This one is thick and complex and the ABV is very well masked making it pretty drinkable. Not the best example of the style but pretty good.","corby112","0"

4.09,8.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall this is a solid attempt at a pumpkin beer by a brewery that usually turns out good beers. It doesn't do much to differentiate itself from others in the style but what's done is done well. Worth a shot.","glid02","Sep 25, 2009"

3.46,-8.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Anyway-very nice autumn hue to it-looks like fall in a glass. Deep orange in color, small tight head. Aroma tends to be very spicy and not enough malt or pumpkin. Flavor comes up a bit with a hint of pumpkin, spices and a touch of caramel sweetness. Good mouthfeel for sure-at 8% a very solid feel to it. Ok overall. Too much spice for me. Now that everyone has a pumpkin/fall beer they all run together including this one. I need more gourd, less spice.","lackenhauser","Sep 22, 2009"
3.79,0.3,4.5,3,4,4,4,"Actually suprisingly tasty after not being too impressed with the aroma. Easy to drink for an imperial pumpkin, dangerously so. Nice mix of spices, not picking up too much pumpkin flavor but I'm not complaining. Still can't believe that the ABV is really as high as it is. Great beer, Charlie Brown.","KickbacksSteve","Sep 20, 2009"
3.75,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Deep brownish amber, very hard to see through but not completely translucent. Thin off white head that recedes to a thick cap with minimal lacing. Mild aroma of pumpkin with light spices (nutmeg most prominent, a little cinnamon) but lingering metallic notes detract from the smell. Thicker, chewy body, with light carbonation, very smooth mouthfeel overall and no alcohol presence. Flavor starts very spicy, clove and cinnamon which mellows out the fruity sweetness which follows and lingers into the finish. Never very overly pumpkin, or spicy for that matter, this beer doesn't really compare in the over the top pumpkin flavors of something like Pumpking. I don't usually care for pumpkin beers that much so this is actually nice in its restraint and balance.","yourefragile","Sep 20, 2009"
