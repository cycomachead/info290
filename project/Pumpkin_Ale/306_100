This brew has an ABV of 5.70%  Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale pours out of the bottle, a nice light brown color with an off white head. The smell is rich with pumpkin and spices. You also pick up on some grains and sweetness in the smell of  this brew. At first the the taste is bold with flavor. It puts you in mind of pumpkin pie. There is a lot going on in this brew. A lot of bold flavor with a nice clean finish.  The mouthfeel is nice bold and clean.  Nothing bad to say about this brew. Over all I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. Coors did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Oct 18, 2014"

The taste is actually very pleasant with the spices and you can taste the cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg as well as the pumpkin. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Good carbonation for this one that wasn't overdone. Overall, better than some other pumpkin ales that I tried and liked this one.","BeerWithMike","Jan 05, 2014"

The wheat body is notable and melds well with the pumpkin and spice overlay. A bit more fuller-bodied than I had expected. Overall, not knocked out by this rather toned-downed and overly-clean seasonal ale. Certainly palatable and quite good, but not optimal for those seeking a more robust pumpkin ale.","coalcracker","Dec 28, 2013"

Color is a clear, somewhat lighter orange amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is beer, malt and a little pumpkin. Flavor's like nose, with carbonic tang dominating, on the dry side, and leans to bland. Body is controlled by over carbonation. Finish is like flavor which is short lived, but has the long lingering tang. One thing I like is the underplaying of the pumpkin flavor, but they went too far.

Aromas of roasted pumpkin, earthy notes, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, hints of vanilla, and a touch of sweet potato. Can't really fault anybody so far on this beer. Flavors are where things start to go awry. Syrupy and sugary sweet forward flavors of pumpkin come at you ham-handed, with an almost instant cloying. The spice characters are completely drowned out, and the roast notes don't stand a chance in balancing this beer out. I guess the saving grace is that the flavor is almost completely gone from your palate in a matter of seconds. The aftertaste is almost non-existent, with hints of toasted grain and a linger of sugary sweetness. Oily slick body, which helps expedite the disappearance of this beer from your palate, leading to an empty finish that I suppose will be deemed clean. This one started off alright, but the drop off was dramatic.","GarthDanielson","Oct 10, 2013"

Scents of pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices that I cannot accurately separate and sweetness. It's a typical, sweet pumpkin ale scent. Taste is sweet, with prominent pumpkin and the same undifferentiated pumpkin pie spices, but with some slight undertones of cinnamon and nutmeg. Some caramel malt flavors throughout and a bit of wheat cracker on the finish with a toasted malt aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit sweet, like most pumpkin ales, the wheat cracker is a nice addition to the flavor profile of an otherwise standard pumpkin ale. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, about what I expected from a pumpkin ale. Overall it's a standard pumpkin ale, with all the good and bad that comes with the style. It manages to separate itself slightly due to the addition of wheat malt, but it's not enough to raise it above "It's a pumpkin ale." status.","Auraan","Oct 06, 2013"

I do enjoy the nutyness that this one packs. Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side but I don't expect anything else with the label "Blue Moon" on it. Overall a nice fall brew.

Had to try it! Taste is very faint, mouth feel is a little bitter but not bad! Smell is very faint almost not there. Overall Blue Moon did not put forth a huge effort on this beer but when do they really???","CervezaMesa","Sep 13, 2013"

Feels like drinking pumpkin pie. Quite enjoyable but I wouldn't have more than a couple of these in one sitting. I wouldn't need to have this beer available year-long, but would look forward to its arrival each year.","rx-beer","Sep 11, 2013"

This time the pumpkin and spice aroma was very strong, and the flavor was extremely sweet and syrupy. Carbonation was almost non existent and it poured up with no head at all. Maybe this was just a bad bottle. Not sure, but now I am hesitant to even open the remainder, however I will in order to give this beer a third chance.","rashley","Sep 08, 2013"

3.54,14.2,2.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Final Thoughts: I've tried (and home-brewed) many pumpkin beers and have come to a few conclusions about the style. The first is that there are a few different types of pumpkin beers, with Blue Moon's Harvest Pumpkin Ale falling into the 'spiced pumpkin' category (as opposed to the 'pumpkin puree' or 'pumpkin pie' group). The second thing I've realized, based on personal taste, is that a pumpkin beer is either excellent or decent. I've just never had a bad one. That's why, for me, Harvest Pumpkin Ale falls in line with many other decent pumpkin beers. It drinks like a pedestrian attempt and the style, which is just fine because it's good. I'd definitely recommend this one to any Amber Ale drinkers looking to broaden their horizons. Would I drink it again? Yep, one of the only Blue Moon products I can say that about.","JamesMN","Sep 07, 2013"

In the taste you get more of that watery pumpkin. Hints of cinnamon are in there as well, but that's about it. Lots of carbonation here, way too much. The carbonation overwhelms the majority of the notes, what little there are. Blue moon actual make some alright brews but this one could use a tune up.","screamking","Sep 01, 2013"

The nose comprises light graham cracker, light cinnamon, and light clove. The taste brings in more of the same, with a slight underlying vein of stale gingerbread. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a decent enough little pumpkin beer, though not something I could see drinking many of, no matter how bad the Bears are doing.","TMoney2591","Aug 03, 2013"

3.28,5.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"a way overly spiced pumpkin beer in my opinion. on tap at dave and busters, this one pours a nice amber shade with a faint orange glow and a fleeting off white head. the nose is nutmeg and clove, a little vanilla, and red and caramel malts. no squash to speak of. the same is true of the flavor, where the heavy spice dose totally crowds out any real pumpkin thats in this beer. its very desserty, like a pumpkin pie, seasonally okay, but to me id like to see more of the actual pumpkin. all the spice makes it a tough beer to session, even though the body is just medium and the carbonation is good. its not a bad beer, dont get me wrong, and definitely better than some of the other blue moon seasonals, but ive come to like my pumpkin beers to showcase the vegetable, not the spice, and this one is just too spice based for me. others may disagree.","StonedTrippin","Nov 09, 2012"

3.15,1.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"O: A good, if unremarkable, seasonal beer. Certainly a solid choice to serve at an autumn gathering, though drinkability suffers somewhat on account of the spicy aftertaste. It seems to lack some of the complexity in flavor that makes other seasonal brews so enjoyable, while the flavors that do emerge can tend to be overpowering, particularly in the aftertaste. I wouldn't refuse one of these beers if handed to me, but given a cooler full of options I might dig around in the ice for a while before grabbing one of these.","maki88","Oct 06, 2012"

3.1,0,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The beer pours a water-clear amber orange with a lot of bubbles racing to the top, and some chillaxing on the side of the glass. There was a nice cream head after the pour but it dissipates quickly leaving a light fringe of lacy cream white bubbles, but a swirl of the glass does rejuvenate a fourth of a finger of head. The beer smells light pumpkin aroma, underlying with nutmeg cinnamon, and cloves. There is a ghost of a wheat malt spice and some roasted malts that oddly wet the nose at the back of the smell, but other than that this beer is all spice and pumpkin, and perhaps a touch of alcohol that burns at the nose, which I find odd for such a low alcohol beer. The beer tastes bitterly fruity with pumpkin and the flavor eating bite of the spices which leave a slight spice-burn tingle on the tongue. The taste is much like the smell in terms of spices, and there are no real surprises hear. The pumpkin tastes a little unripe on the tongue and leaves a bitter bite on the aftertaste that I associate with unripe fruit. Very faint hints of spice are found from the wheat, and a weird syrupy sweet flavor actually clotted my tongue for a brief moment. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth, with only a faint bite from the carbonation, and a dry-yet-damp feeling is left after the beer leaves. My mouth is pretty damp with saliva but my tongue feels a little dry and sandpapery. Overall this is a mediocre pumpkin beer. It is definitely a pumpkin beer, which is good, but it carries some of the hallmarks of mass-brewing, and suffers for it. The beer could have a better mouthfeel and a riper feel to the pumpkin flavor. Worth a sip if you like pumpkin beer, but I would pick-up a Shipyard Pumpkinhead over this if I was looking for an easily accessible pumpkin beer to try.","Maxwell","Aug 22, 2012"

The aroma is nice; I picked up some cloves, pumpkin spices, all spice, cinnamon, figs and raisins. It has a medium to light mouthfeel, and leans more toward light… Its crisp and sharp tasting throughout, on the tip of your tongue its mildly bitter, but the spices come out as it travels towards the back of your throat. As it hits the mid-section of your tongue, you can taste the spices and cloves; by the time it hits the back of your mouth the cloves, allspice and cinnamon are more present. This beer maintains its crispness throughout and is very pleasant overall, but the flavors could be a bit more present.","vickersspitfire","Aug 05, 2012"

Its extract can only be added as an after-flavor to a traditional beer. Hence, ginger ale. Nonetheless, this sucks!","robmorris31","Dec 03, 2011"

Poured red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pumpkin, clove, and cinnamon. The flavor was of sweet malt, pumpkin, cinnamon, wheat, and nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. You can tell what they were going for with this one based on the aroma and flavor here. However, they just seemed to fall a little short for my liking. While the flavors were okay in this one, they just seemed a little diluted. Also, the nutmeg aspect I got in this one was definitely not needed at all and might have helped this brew out if it were not present.

Since I enjoy "flavor" in my pumpkin beer, I'll stick to Dogfish Head, Weyerbacher or Smuttynose versions when I'm looking for solid rendition of the style.

Finishes on the dry side. Mouthfeel is light-medium, it is definitely a more autumn-oriented sipping beer much like an O-Fest. Overall it is very good and that's saying a lot coming from Coors.

The overall look of this beer is awesome. I love the deep orange/copper color... But I feel like it comes up short beyond that. The smell is slight, the taste is slight over all it's nothing to get very excited about.

There's also some grain there if you really swirl the glass and hunt for it. The taste is largely typical macrobrew, (grain, little to no hops, light on the malt). There is a little bit of spice (nutmeg perhaps) but it is faint. It's not a bad beer per se, just disappointing.

No pumpkin, just spice with a slight grainy malt flavors adding in. Bittterness of hops is present but doesn't do much beyond adding bitterness. This beer doesn't live up to the style at all.

Aroma is less pumpkin spices and more fruity, estery, hints of bubble gum and a nice crystal malt hint as well that would be killer if there were more spices. The flavor disappoints as well, the beer is lighter than I am looking for and thinner as well and is a little out of balance with slightly unpleasant bitterness. I tend to favor pumpkin and pumpkin spice ales that remind you of a liquid pumpkin pie and this doesn't get there at all. I feel like this is a gimmick; many people think ALL fruit/herb/spice beers are, and I disagree emphatically, but in this case I think Coors wanted a pumpkin beer and they made it very uninspiring (I actually like the white ale for what it is and their winter Belgian is OK too.)

Everything about this beer fit nicely into that description. As far as I could discern there were no distinct aromas or flavors to speak of. Lightly malted with a very tiny hint of clove and cinnamon at the end and that is only when I was trying really hard to find anything that would make this a "pumpkin ale" vs a "brown ale".

Slightly astringent grain up front. Soapy, biscuity malt follows. Semi-sweet, with a vegetal edge. Allspice and clove into the finish.

The taste is of light pumpkin with some of the pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg and allspice. The pumpkin flavors are washed away by a grainy, watery base.

A ton of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom kept it replenished enough that it had some nice side glass lace present. The aroma was very inviting, tons of spice were blowing you away from the very beginning. I was quite impressed with how strong the aroma of nutmeg and spice coming off of it was. A nice malty and bread like back was apparent as well and this translated over to the taste wonderfully. A deep rich spiced flavor came over you immediately. It had the definite pumpkin pie spiced taste, but not overblown. This was subtle enough to get the pint across without being too sweet and really making you say enough. Great feel, nice and light with a great medium body and full flavor. The carbonation stuck around until the very end and made it feel very full. I easily could have had more then one and was quite surprised with how easy of a drinker it was. Overall I really actually enjoyed this. I have had some better seasonals before, but this was a solid offering and there was no doubt about it.

It got worse as it warmed to the point that I just didn't want to try anymore. As some reviewers stated, the name is a misnomer because this is a Coors product, and had I known, I would have skipped it altogether. Coors is a weak product and this one seems to fit into their target audience. Keep going if you are in the mood for a nice pumpkin ale.

Not overly pumpkin if thats what your looking for, but quite good overall.","SPLITGRIN","Feb 11, 2007"

Along with the other, since-discontinued Blue Moon brands it was well-liked and remained fondly remembered . . . until now. I first tried this over ten years ago but don't recall it tasting like . . . this! Alcohol pervades the nose and overwhelms the malt-profile of this otherwise well-remembered brew, and that ain't a good thing, it means this brew lacks balance. Theres some spice up there in the nose but . . . booze and spice? Theres a Cap n Coke with your name on it in any bar in town, why go for this? Some pale, biscuity malt present throughout, but the weight of the spice and the booze tends to overwhelm it. Seems a bit thin, but it's on par for the style (at least considering the other commercial examples of a pumpkin beer). No real pumpkin presence/flavour to speak of, just a pale malt spice booze logjam all up in the joint. And carbonation . . . a touch overly-carbonated, like a selzer. And the sweetness: next to the booze and spice it's quite prominent. Not a pumpkin beer (let alone a fruit/vegetable beer) that I'd recommend to others, and I'd probably turn down a free one if it was offered. Still, if you haven't tasted a better-made pumpkin ale you'll love this and will call my store and be pissed-off that we're out of stock (don't blame me! The local wholesaler ordered it in a VERY limited quantity, blah blah blah) There *are* other Pumpkin Ales out there, ya know . . . branch the hell out, girls!","Chaz","Jan 16, 2007"

Definite spice presence. Tastes sharply sweet up front punctuated with a clove bite, mellows somewhat toward the middle into more of a doughy malt, but the spices remain, somewhat overwhelming the underlying malt. If nutmeg, clove, and allspice are your thing, youll likely enjoy the flavor. Id prefer a more subtle spice presence, myself. Mouth is pretty watery with little body, but short of being too thin. Decent carbonation on the tongue. Drinkability is fair; personally I wouldnt want to drink too many. It leaves an overwhelming taste of spice on my tongue.

Plenty of sweetness in the smell, as well as spice. A tiny bit of clove with a healthy dose of nutmeg. Excellent. The taste, too, is "par for the course" for autumn seasonals. A little bready/yeasty. Some spice is certainly evident in the taste. This would be really good with some honey glazed ham. Mouthfeel is nice. Not too heavy, nor too light. Very ever so slightly syrupy.

Flavors of pumpkin and Thanksgiving spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg) add to the light malty sweetness. Mouthfeel leaves much to yearn for--weak and a bit over carbonated.

It has a natural pumpkin scent, not like canned processed pumpkin. It smells like my homebrews. The taste is relatively good. It is smooth with a nice pumpkin flavor that is not overpowering and finishes creamy. It has a decent malt palate of pale and crystal malts. There are hints of nutmeg and other spices; very tastey.

This one comes across as a conservatively "safe" tasting beer when compared to others like Buffalo Bill's, New Holland's Ichabod or Lakefront's Pumpkin lager. Not sure if I'd recommend this one at all. Pretty weak interpretation of the style.","Winter","Nov 02, 2003"

I suppose there was a little pumpkin-type spiciness in the flavor, but not as much as I expected. The malts were there in the taste as well as a refreshing hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and it was easy to drink. Maybe just a little too much yeast, but I really enjoyed it.

Hmmm this is not what I expected in the taste, clean maltiness with very, very subtle pumpkin pie spice, in the aftertaste pumpkin is noticeable briefly dull hops in the background. This beer doesnt have much flavor working; Id expected much more spice flavor. It left me with a tacky, cheesy mouthfeel. Not good. Medium body. This is more like an Amber Ale with a kiss of pumpkin pie spice. Im glad I didnt buy a six-pack of this stuff because I would struggle to finish it.

It had a good smell and the apperance was definately the highlight. It was a nice amber golden color, but the head was magnificent. It was oh so thick and last a little while too.

Taste: A flavor that is based upon a bready sweet caramel tone and complemented by a swirling stint of cinnamon and mild pumpkin tones, I have sampled some pumpkin ales that just can't pull this off. Should I say Ein Prosit to Coors, for doing something solid from their brewing empire. Not outstanding but definitely not bad I enjoy this brew. Mouthfeel: Is a bit sticky but it goes down fairly well no overpowering extracts just right carbonation is a little rough making each sip just a bit more cloying than it should be.

What I like is that the spices to drown out the pumpkin and malt flavors as happens in other pumpkin beers. This one's got a juicy pumpkin pulp flavor complimented by caramel maltiness.

Aroma comprised of faint nutmeg and cinnamon layered over sweet caramel and bready malt. Trace banana esters. Smells like dilute pumpkin pie. Tame, but clean. Transient wash of dryish, biscuit like malt upfront in flavor is ensued by balmy lightly caramelized brown sugar sweetness. Understated, generic pie spices surface mid palate manage to overwhelm the vapidly bready, overly neutral base malt undertone. Soft hop bitterness, with a nearly complete dearth of hop flavor, only a token hint of earthiness is discerned. Thinnish body with an odd, oily viscosity in mouthfeel. Finishes dry and approaching bland, with an unexpected tinge of alcohol warmth. An innocuous, softly spiced brew two notches beyond bland. It's akin to a prosaic, caramel malt driven amber ale with a pinch of pie spice added directly to the glass. Quaffable, but forgettable.","marc77","Oct 01, 2003"

The flavor was also very good, it seems to combine an octoberfest malty sweetness with a seasonal twist, featuring only a hint of pumpkin that lingers on the middle of the tongue.
