4.34,6.9,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Had on tap in Hallstatt Austria. This was definitely a very unique beer. A very hazy color hits you right away with a 3 finger foam head. Very carbonated and refreshing taste. As everyone wrote, not a common beer and it struck me at first as a pilsner but I was wrong. Very florally and vibrant smell and the taste was the same. Nice yeasty taste with a mild amount of hops. I can't put my finger on this one, but something I may need to bring back to Boston. Great find.","BradMacMullin","Dec 29, 2013"

4.25,4.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy pale gold topped with a thick, creamy two finger bright white head. Superb retention and thick, splotchy lacing. Light fruit, hints of grass, floral notes, and fresh bread dough on the nose. Opens with grass and grain notes, joined by bready, yeasty malt, a touch of honey and sweet cream, apple blossoms, and apple and pearskin. Heavy light body to very light medium body. Silky mouthfeel with a touch of creaminess. This is one darn good brew and my favorite zwickl to date. Highly recommended.","chanokokoro","Jul 25, 2012"

Only a few tastes are necessary to understand the 'give' and 'take' that recent developments have caused to the brewing scene. Though I appreciate the cleaner, crisper flavors and textures of today's well made lagers, it's easy to see that this process removes some of the rich flavor that this beer exhibits very well.","BEERchitect","Jul 30, 2011"

4.06,0,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I was pleasantly surprised--pours a dark straw in an awesome glass with an impressively steady head and good lacing. Smells kind of boringly lagery with a hint of skunk but what can you expect from the style. Taste, on the other hand, is clean bready malts, light citrus/grass hops, some apple notes from the yeast, lots of yeast, as there should be, giving it a good creamy/gritty mouthfeel. Nice Zwickl and there should be more in the US.","lstokes","Nov 21, 2010"

4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It was a dark gold color, very cloudy. The taste was malty and a bit sweet, though balanced and refreshing, with a big mouth feel. On the richer side of a good sessionable beer. Very happy that I tried it.","branko7","Apr 09, 2010"
3.56,-12.3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Mellow, slightly murky flavor with decent maltiness. Rather tart. Hint of wheat beer flavors and a grainy sweetness. Hops are restrained but reasonably balanced. An unassuming, modest kind of beer but very satisfying. Good mouthfeel-- not rich but robust.","mactrail","Apr 05, 2010"
4.06,0,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Body is creamy as hell, almost to German Hefe levels. Smooth from the high quantities of unfiltered yeast, giving it a pretty full mouthfeel for a lager. Session-worthy for sure, the bigger body doesn't hinder it at all. Get it while you can, this will only be around for the season.","emerge077","Apr 04, 2010"
2.46,-39.4,4,3,2,3,2,"D - Can't stand it, get this feeling in my mouth afterwards like I've been drinking hydrogen peroxide. Couldn't drink much of it at all. My first exposure to this style, but if this is what they're like it may well be my last.","AgentZero","Dec 03, 2008"
3.96,-2.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"As far as lagers go, this is easily one of the best ones out there. Not my style of choice, but if I wanted a balanced, good tasting, session lager I'd go for this.","jrallen34","Nov 24, 2006"

4.18,3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Pleasantly surprised. After I read the basics of the Zwickl style I was somewhat tentative, not being a huge fan of overly hopped, grassy German pilsners. But this is nothing like those styles, being very, very well-balanced and complex, with a light-medium body and great taste. I would have no problem putting away a six pack of this, and as this is my only bottle, I'm sad to see it go. I sorta want some more...","InDreams","Jun 14, 2005"
