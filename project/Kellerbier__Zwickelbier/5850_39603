3.43,-5.2,4.25,3,3.5,4,3.25,"The head on this beer is amazing. Retention and lacing are very good. It's got a bit of chill haze, which seems to accentuate the dark orange colour. The smell is characteristic of a Kellerbier, but even so it's never been one of my favourite things about this type of beer. It smells quite musty, with a little grass and sour cherry. The taste is actually quite neutral - refreshing, light, grainy, but not too much emphasis on either the malts or the hops. Mouthfeel is very dry, with a medium body. It's hard to score a Kellerbier high, but this one's one of the better examples in Bavaria.","Intrinsic","May 06, 2014"
