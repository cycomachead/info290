3.76,1.9,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Gotta hand it to Off Color for brewing up a style that most brewers completely ignore.  This stuff pours a partly cloudy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet grain, sweetgrass, mild greens, and flowers.  The taste brings in more of the same, the flowery grassiness taking full root.  The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather fluid feel.  Overall, a solid zwickel, something easy to drink and unprepossessing.  Not bad at all.","TMoney2591","Feb 27, 2015"
