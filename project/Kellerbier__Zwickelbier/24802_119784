Not very well balanced, and the lager base was OK but not great. Could use more work but still tasty and enjoyable.","jlindros","Nov 28, 2014"

3.83,-0.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"This pilsner is more prickly than most. Although the hop provides some of this bite, I believe most of this comes from the very dry pale malt base. The swallow is dry and balanced. The aftertaste is relatively brief. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but this might be enhanced by the high level of effervescence.","smcolw","Jul 06, 2014"
