3.5,-5.4,,,,,,"The beer is a cloudy, pale yellow with a white cap. Ample lacing. Aromas of bread, yeast. Pilsner malt with a mild hop component. Easy drinking. Light in body. I'd have this again.","Huhzubendah","Apr 12, 2014"

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O - Nice beer, good for the style. Enjoyable to drink and easy to get down. Has some decent complexity for how low ABV it is.","AgentZero","Feb 14, 2012"
3.78,2.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"O - A really nice beer that's super-easy to drink. Lots going on, and at 4.4%, I would drink early and often. Something perfect for the summer months again. Good stuff.","Sean9689","Feb 05, 2012"

4.2,13.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Beer is light in body and grindingly earthy, nice wet finish, tastes great in my opinion a very good variant on the kolsch. Very fun. I'd have this again.","drabmuh","Jan 30, 2012"
4.17,12.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The flavor is similar. Bread and yeast come forward with the base in the background. Nice yeastiness through the finish. Moderate hop component. Crisp, but not as much so as the regular kolsch; this is probably halfway between kolsch and hefeweizen in body and feel. Really a nicely done brew. Bill and company deserve the accolades on this one.","Thorpe429","Beers"
3.63,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This was tasty and refreshing, with the unfiltered nature of this maybe taking away a bit of the crispness from the overall flavor profile but then added some unique qualities to this that more than made for it.","Kegatron","0"
