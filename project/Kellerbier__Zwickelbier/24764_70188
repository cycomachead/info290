The breadiness is definitely a yeasty character more than a melanoidin breadiness, but a little of that comes through in the aftertaste.  Overall, this beer is a very good rendition of a Bavarian lager and will stand up to the best.  I hope to be enjoying more of this over the summer months to come!","steveh","Mar 03, 2015"

The first thing that I thought of when I took my first wiff and taste of this beer was a beer that is similiar to an Octoberfest style beer.  If I would have gotten a blind pour and did not know who the brewer was... I would have guessed that Dan Carey brewed this beer. And we all know that Dan Carey is the master when it comes to brewing German lagers. This is definately a high quality german lager and it is on the same level as any of Dan's German lagers that he brews. I give this beer high regards, so get a sample of this brew from Urban Chestnut!  What a gem!","4DAloveofSTOUT","Nov 12, 2014"

The taste brings in more of the same, but everything comes through dry, listless, and strangely bitter (that isn't to say that the bitterness was necessarily unexpected, but rather it was unexpectedly expressed). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

It features blond German esque malt, slight hop character, and a bit of corn as well. It smells like a fresh helles. The flavors are a little more complex. The pale malt offers a slight sweetness off the bat. The bitterness is mellow and you get plenty of that German helles character with a touch of yeast, pretty spot on for a Zwickel. It drinks light in body with good carbonation. Overall this is pretty good for the style. The freshness is probably this beer's greatest strongpoint and it's hard to find this type of unfiltered lager fresh.","aasher","Aug 29, 2012"

4.4,15.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Served this Zwickel style Bier in a Stein at the brewery. Poured a hazy copper color, produced a excellent creamy white head, great retention and ample lacing. The aroma consists of sweet malted grain, yeast and hops. Moderate body, this traditional style beer had an off the charts mouthfeel- one of the smoothest beers I have ever had- . A base of sweet pale malt, well balanced, crisp and clean- balanced well with hops. Excellent Session beer- I really enjoyed this. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 04, 2012"

Fits the style of a Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of yeast, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, good appearance, blend, and body.","Tone","Nov 15, 2011"

Being one of the flagship brews, I think UC chose an effective way to introduce people to the brewery.","birchstick","Jul 09, 2011"
3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall Impression- This wasn't what I remember as the Zwickel style but I'll take it as it is. I looked up common attributes for this style and this beer almost everything fit every category. There are much better brews from U.C. but I enjoyed this greatly. Had no other choice since coming from a Growler.","DCon","Jun 28, 2011"

3.8,0,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a clear golden yellow with a small, delicate, white head. Grassy aroma, pale malts, and light yeast. More of the same in the taste, crisp, light, grassy, crackery pale malts; not much in the way of hops, but there was a little bit of spicy bitterness in the aftertaste. Light bodied and refreshing, and easily drinkable.","Rifugium","0"
