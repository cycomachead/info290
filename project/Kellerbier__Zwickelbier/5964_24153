3.7,3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"BB Oct-05. Great white foam that's thick as whipped cream and beautifull and very clowdy golden beer. Smell is fresh, very hopflowery( H.mittelfrueh or Saaz?). Together with litle maltarome of palemalt and some yeastesters making it a good nose. Taste is litle empty, alcoholic and malty. Still the fresh and flowery hops noticable making this one enjoyable. Hops are good but there is a litle yeastbitterness in the aftertaste. Not that disturbing though and the brew overall gives a fresh and flowery mouthfeel, but be aware of the alcohol cause it drinks like lemonade.","paterlodie","0"
