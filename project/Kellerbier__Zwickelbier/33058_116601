4.25,19.7,,,,,,"a pilsner style beer with a complexity that takes it beyond what you'd usually experience with Pilsner type brews.  it's got a mix of hoppiness and grassy flavors that keep it interesting through a session.  kudos to Ecliptic for being willing to reach out a little from the norm.","ricke49","Aug 05, 2014"

3.74,5.4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a one finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, wheat, pilsner hops, hint of sulfur and toffee, unusual, but good. Flavor is biscuit malt, mild citrus, grassy, haylike hops, finishing with grassy hops bitterness and biscuit. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A nice little hybrid between wheat and pilsner beers, and not a bad representative of a kellerbier, which is not a common style. The flavor seems a bit understated at first, but the long lingering finish is a nice balance of dry haylike and biscuit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. Nicely balanced. I like this quite a bit more than I expected to. I would consider this for a hot summer day session ale with good, offbeat flavors.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2014"
