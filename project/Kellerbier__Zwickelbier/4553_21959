4.29,13.8,3.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"This is a really nice example of the style- lots of doughy and bready malt, for sure, but it also lets the hops show through, so it's got a little zip in its step. The mid-palate is where the malt and spicy hops give way to a gentle and tasty orange marmalade fruitiness, before giving way to a touch of grassy hops and yeasty finish. Impeccable balance and harmony of flavors, too. I can't say I've had very many Zwickels, but this is by far the best of the lot- go out and get some now!","TongoRad","Jun 02, 2014"

4.26,13,5,4,4.25,4,4.5,"Poured a beautiful cloudy orange with three fingers of fluffy white head. Quite appealing to the eyes. Scents of apple juice, sweet malt, doughy bread like scents and yeast. Nothing to out of the ordinary, but pleasant. Flavors of sweet malt, bread, yeast and an undertone of German hops. It finishes with a nice dry after taste that balances the malty sweetness of the rest of the sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, like a lot of German style beers I've tried. This is a very good, very unique beer, in some ways like a cross between a pilsner and a hefeweizen. I like it a lot.","Auraan","Feb 22, 2013"

3.96,5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a hazed deep orange tinged golden with a large fluffy white crown that took its time fading into a frothy mass leaving broken rings of lace behind.Yeasty and doughy aromas with a tinge of iron,lightly sweet.The mouthfeel is coating but not heavy,just very smooth.Mildly sweet doughy flavors with a hint of anise,quite yeasty to be expected,faint iron in the finish.Iam sure this is as food friendly as all get out,although not in your face flavors this is top notch for the style.Furst brings it.","oberon","Nov 21, 2012"

2.96,-21.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Taste is musty with sulfur notes. It tastes really like an unfiltered beer with too much yeast in it. The doughy notes included. There is a slightly sweet maltiness that has some decoction notes of Maillard and caramellized products.","Absumaster","May 04, 2007"

3.08,-18.3,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Hazy golden beer with a few bubbles rising gingerly along the edges. Big foamy off-white head has a creamy top and leaves thick patches of lace. Light bready aroma with just a hint of crisp citrus. Fresh out of the fridge there is almost no flavor. Maybe a bit of malt with a bite at the end, but that's it. A light bodied beer with a good kick of fizz after you swallow. A little maltier as it warms, but a bit stale, with mildly bitter lemony finish. Fancy bottle, fancy label, mediocre beer.","HappyHourHero","Beers"
4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Nose is malty, sweet and has the typical german yeastesters with it. Taste is full malty, litle maltsweet before getting into a litle bitter but very clean( as the rest of the brew is) aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't overwelming but in a good balance. Drinkabilty is cause of the finesse of the brew more then ok. Good beer.","paterlodie","0"
