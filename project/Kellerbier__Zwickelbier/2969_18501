3.08,-9.7,4,2.25,3,3,4,"overall: Why is this brew so good. For some reason this is a great beer and I love it but it doesn't taste like much and it really isn't very filling. Its just a generally good beer. And the wife loves it.","JCBears","Jun 15, 2013"
3.8,11.4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"O - Although very light and mainly dominated by yeasty and citrusy flavours (something I'm not normally a huge fan of), something about this beer was really enjoyable. It has such a crisp, summery feel to it that it feels like you can drink it anytime. My .5L BÃ¼gelflasche was purchased at a CenterParcs in Germany, and for a bit under 2 euros, I'd say it's quite a steal.","freneticamnesic","May 30, 2013"

3.1,-9.1,3,3,3,3.5,3.25,"I was disappointed in this beer. Today I went to the speciality beer shop in Berlin, and i decided to buy 8 or so beers with the only criteria that each cost more than e2.00/ltr (or e1.00 for a standard 1/2l bottle). This approach probably weeds out 80-90% of the multitude of offerings. So tonight I've had a cracking couple of beers. But I hate to say it, this one is doing very little for me indeed, despite it's price.","JonnoWillsteed","Sep 05, 2012"

3.15,-7.6,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Taste is a light and has a raw malt smell, some straw and floury notes. The beer has yeast in it, and that comes through in the taste. A fleshy taste.","Absumaster","Jul 01, 2008"

3.2,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"I believe that it's "a genuine fresh product," as the label claims, and it's certainly interesting, but I'm just kind of underwhelmed by this one.","jenitivecase","Oct 02, 2007"
3.08,-9.7,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"The softness of the flavour and feel make it reasonably drinkable, but not incredibly so. It's not something for all occasions, either. For watching a EuroCup final, it's not unsuitable but not ideal. Slightly above average, overall.","Gamemako","Sep 03, 2007"
3.18,-6.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"The dry sourness does stay in the mouth, but the overall feel is only average, the brewer hasn't pushed any boats out. This is a run of the mill kellerbier, I was hoping for more from an old Pilsner brewery I used to support when living in Germany.","BlackHaddock","Feb 13, 2005"
3.12,-8.5,4.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This is a little chewy and well bodied, even for the lower alcohol content. The left over yeasts leave behind a unique texture.","TheSarge","Jul 04, 2004"
3.53,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Best before 30-04-05. Pours in fine and gives a nice head that stays quiet well. Golden color with a fine opalizing cloud. Nose is fine too, sweet malty, fresh and delicate yeastfruit. Taste is litle empty though; lightly malted, watery and dry. That with a poor hopping giving just a light aftertaste and mouthfeel. Only that mouthfeel is a litle tinkled by the carbon dioxide. Drinkability is ok but am a litle dissapointed in this one being a German Urtyp Unfiltriert! Nothing wrong with it though.","paterlodie","Beers"
3.23,-5.3,4,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"This beer has weizen like looks. Pours a cloudy light yellow. A thick white head meets the top of the glass but rapidly fades away. Aroma of yeast is present. Not a weizen yeast but a musty smell. Taste is more pilsner like with a yeast backing. Thin body and a watery feel kilss this beer. Overall an O.K brew to try.","Stubbie1","0"
