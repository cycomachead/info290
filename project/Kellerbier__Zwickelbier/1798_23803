3.46,-10.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium body; fairly pronounced carbonation. Drinkability: Yes! Refreshing besides the rather “oily” (and perhaps even spicey) aftertaste.","patra7","Apr 29, 2012"
3.18,-17.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Golden colour, clear medium thin head which disappeared. Typical grassy, malty smell with hints of red cabbage. Tasted fairly bitter, hsd notes of sour apples but was reasonably balanced. Smoothish mouthfull, moderate carbonation. Not bad, wasn't sure if it was a Keller/Zwickel or a Märzen, not that interesting, probably won't revisit.","jonb5","Nov 14, 2011"

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkablity is near perfect. Light, refreshing and easy to drink. Great tradional style slightly above the normal flavor profile. Personally I find this every bit a good as the more famous Tegernsee or Augustiner examples. Zum Wohl!","czfreeman","Nov 07, 2005"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle, bought in Bier Spezi Hoheluft, Hamburg. Some sediment in the bottle. Hazy golden colour, large and lingering off-white head. Pleasant aroma of aromatic hops, notes of citrus, flowers and honey, hints of oak and leather. Flavour is fairly malty and relatively sweet, well balanced with pleasant hops, some oaky and spicy elements. This is what a golden lager SHOULD taste like! Industrial junk pushers: See, smell, drink and LEARN!","Sigmund","May 21, 2005"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"BB 12-05. Nice white head and a opalising golden brew. Nose is good, showing good maltiness, lots of fresh hops with sulphuric ite. Good and fresh and a nice alcoholnose over it make nose ok. Tate is fresh, good bodied, nicely malted and well bittered though IMO could be litle higher. Overal fine, clean and inviting brew only gets alcohol litle on the front while brew warms up. Good carbonisation makes mouthfeel balanced except for maybe the alcohol but overal a very plesant and good beer that gives fresh enjoyment.","paterlodie","Beers"
