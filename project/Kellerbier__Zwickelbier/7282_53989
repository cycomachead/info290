Earthy, light roasted malt aroma with notes of dark fruit, herbal hops and yeasty tartness. Medium bodied with a lightlyp crisp finish. Light roasted malt flavors up front followed by earthy grain and yeasty notes. Herbal hop flavors from the middle to the end. This was advertised as an Octoberfest the way the German's meant it to be - which was not the case. Certainly different.","IronLover","Aug 10, 2014"

4.17,8.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The relative richness of the flavor presents an intriguing contrast with the lightness of the body and the texture of the beer.

4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is pretty nice- medium bodied, somewhat delayed moderate carbonation (at first it feels smooth and then becomes a little prickly).

3.91,2.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Not your average Octoberfest but very drinkable regardless. The smell is almost of an auld ale nature, with hints of smokiness. Yet the taste is very different: easy to drink, smooth, balanced, malty. You know you've had a pretty good sized beer when you're done. Worth trying.","Beer-A-Lot","Sep 29, 2012"

4.07,6.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a slightly cloudy medium coppery amber with an active half finger off-white head that dissipates slowle to a thin film which has good retention, no lacing. Pleasant aroma of caramel malt, light stone fruit, and aromatic herbs. Flavor of toasted and bready malts, mild dark fruit, somewhat sweet. Finishes with mild malt, apples and light hops. A quite nice flavor progression and great flavor combination. Medium bodied. First European example of this style; glad to have tried it and looking forward to drinking this again.","LiquidAmber","Jun 27, 2012"

4.52,18,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Very good beer! Poured this at a good temperature with a large, thick, foamy, cream-colored head that slowly settles and a little lace. Color is an almost clear, honey amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is a fresh, volatile mix of malt, hop, toffee, yeast, a little fruit. Flavor's like nose, on the dry side, with a little residual fruitiness; carbonic tang and yeast/hop bitter are all up front and work well together. Body is excellent - has a softness that is checked by great carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and is super drinkable. Could drink the hell outta this one.","drpimento","Jun 09, 2012"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a ruddy orange with no head beyond a thin cap of bubbles; slightly hazy. The smell is grain, something like lavender, clean well water. It tastes woody, with notes of sweet grain, some faint dandelion sourness, and has a thickly bitter finish. It's a tad thick and fairly viscous, but that's offset by a fine and sharp carbonation. A well made beer, if perhaps a little heavier than need be.","gory4d","Apr 01, 2012"

Finish is sweet toasted caramel, barley, yeasty and bready with some dark fruity flavors and lightly hopped. This brew has a nice well balanced malty character.

4.2,9.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D - Wonderful collection of flavors in this beer, and the fact that it is unfiltered is a nice touch. I've been a big fan of this brewery for a while, and this it a great addition to their lineup. It's a little cost prohibitive to be your sole beer for an Oktoberfest session of drinking, but it's a great place to start. The only thing I would personally change would be a slightly crisper finish. Still, it's hard to blend complexity and drinkability, and I feel this beer has done it better than an other Oktoberfest I've had this year.","SammyDavisJrJrJr","Jan 27, 2011"

2.8,-26.9,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Poured from bottle into dimpled mug. An interesting beer. Deep amber pour with a thick white head. A little bit hazy. Good looking beer. The nose is a little bit herbal and woody with a bit of light hoppy spiciness. There is a decent bit of bready/crusty maltiness on the back of a nice fresh continental malt flavour. There is a massive, distracting metallic flavour on the back that is brutal. It completely ruins the impression I had. It would have been pretty nice without it, but with it there it's tough to take.","CuriousMonk","Nov 05, 2010"

3.8,-0.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This was in a wooden cask that was tapped at the Bier Garden's Oktoberfest celebration. A dark auburn brown body with a two-finger tan head that died quickly and left little lace patches. Has a bitter hop smell as well as some oakiness, natch, and a touch of spicy citric notes. The beer is smooth and creamy thanks to sitting in that cask but still has a sharp twinge from carbonation. The malt base is sturdy and gives off breadiness and a touch of sweet caramel - the hops are dominant and there is a citric, spicy taste that is crisp that dominates the beer. Was enjoyable and worth a try.","clayrock81","Oct 01, 2010"
3.93,2.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Now this an odd beer,it is a zwickel/keller beer for sure but it also has some fest beer qualities to it,making for an interesting hybrid in my mind.Poured into a half liter stein a hazed copper color with a nice fluffy white crown atop that left broken rings of lace as it settled.Toasty with caramel and anise spice in the nose,not much presence but the malt qualities are distinct and nice.Quite dry and toasty at first on the palate with some of that central European iron-like quality,then some honey and caramel malt creeps in the finish.I like this beer but I cant define it,a hazed marzen/fest beer maybe?","oberon","Sep 26, 2010"

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: This is a nice beer, my first of the style. Was highly reminiscent of a pilsner but a heartier malt backbone.","Jayli","Beers"
3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is nice milder beer with a good amount of flavor and substance to make it worth drinking for a while.","TheManiacalOne","0"
