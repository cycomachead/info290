3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, floral, grass, straw, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Czech pilsner style. All around good robustness and balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 28, 2014"

The taste is heavy on the Belgian sugar and Belgian yeast, with some graham cracker malt and lots of sharp bitter hops. This beer excels in its mouthfeel, full and clean and sharp all at once.

Smell is of malt, grain, citrus zest, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is quite tasty and drinkable. Interesting to see such a beer from a brewery known for gueuze and lambic.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 22, 2012"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Cap dated 02/09/11! Served from bottle into a Drie Fonteinen ‘3’ long stemmed flute. Poured a slightly hazy yellow-orange with a one finger white head that remained throughout. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, lemon zest, lemon rine, lemon meringue, citrus, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, lemon zest, citrus, lemon rine, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The aroma on this one was definitely the highlight of this brew as the lemon meringue aspect was really quite pleasant and inviting. The flavor was fairly light, but still quite complex. Definitely a well done Czech Pilsener if I’m honest. Glad I got to try this one and it was even half-off! I suggest you do the same.","thagr81us","Mar 19, 2012"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Good pilsener, quite dry and spicy. This beer pours a mildly hazy banana yellow with a healthy white head. Big chunks of foam stick to the sides of the glass. The aroma is mostly grassy hops, clean, light malt and very mildly fruity yeast. The fruitiness is reminiscent of peppercorns and dried lemon rind. The taste is rather dry for the style. The peppercorn spice is much stronger on the tongue, and the grassy hops pack a pretty good punch in the finish. This is not really an easy drinking pils, but it's interesting without straying too much from the style. Mouthfeel is light and a bit slick. The dry and bitter finish is just this side of harsh. Price was a bit high, but I'm glad to have tried it.","popery","Aug 08, 2010"
4.28,9.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Nice hazy straw color. Big puffy head that lifts out of my glass like a meringue. The amount of head retention left me in awe actually. Smells like crisp light malt and grassy hops. Light sweet taste and a balanced earthy bitterness. I would like a touch more sweetness and hop flavor though. Finish ends with a small amount of acidity. Completely refreshing. Crisp carbonation. One of the best german style lagers I've had. Left me wanting more.","BearsOnAcid","Jul 29, 2010"
4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"wow. very impressive and true to what it claims to be... a lager with a drie fonteinen personality. dark, burnt gold with a white head that holds and goes to collar. nose is floral and bready like a lager should be with some citrus and honey notes popping up, but what i think is really cool is that there seems to be a faint, rustic, musty, earthy and almost sour thing going on in the background (especially when it is colder, which was strange to me) that really gives it an authentic taste and original personality. good balance, nice, light body that was a tad overcarbonated for my taste, and that is just barely. really a fun beer to try, and quite refreshing. too bad this carried a 5.99 price tag for an 11.2oz bottle!!","timtim","Jun 09, 2010"
3.71,-4.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Beersels Lager has a favorable impression overall but it is very minerally (salty) and has a lot of sulfury and acidic notes that compete with the softer malty compounds and pure floral hop notes. These may hurt the beer as much as they help.","BEERchitect","May 07, 2010"

The smell is faint but pleasant: notes of wheat, corn, light citrus, and a vague sense of red berries. The taste follows the smell, berries included (again, there is no direct berry flavor, but rather a general impression thereof hiding somewhere in the distance). The bitterness of the hops comes through very well, but the finish is overly dry and chalky. The body as a whole is quite moderate, with the right amount of carbonation and the right amount of smoothness, creating a highly drinkable pils.","TMoney2591","Nov 03, 2009"

3.93,0.8,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"pour is golden with a nice white soapy head. about 2 fingers which fade to a wonderful lace. smell at first is grass but that is over powered with a distinct lemon. there is an subtle aroma of straw in the backbone. which comes through in the palate as the dry ending. beer is honey malt sweet and has a belgian blond like volume of pollen. somewhere in between those styles really. pilsner and belgian blonde, single or whatever name BA has for it. the dough is absolute belgian, the predominate lemon zest nature has a mild apple and caramel not to it. and the finish is a very slight bitter. excellent for the abv. would rate it as a 'drinkable' pilsner though. somewhat unconventional... somewhere between beligian and plzen. don't think its a czech pils though. more so a lemony belgian blond with a bitter pilsner finish.","rtepiak","Apr 16, 2009"

Minor dough kicks in. Flavor is definitely interesting. Very unique for the style, but very well done. Crisp with some apple on there and a defined sweetness. But really it is fairly dry and hits smoothly and then falls off, but in a good way. Feel is smooth on liquid and has a full carbonation.

The beer pours a slightly cloudy golden color with not a whole lot of carbonation. There is a white head and some lacing. The smell has the nice musty, wet grass aromas of a pilsner with some sweeter malts in the background. The taste is not as sharp, a little creamier, a bit more floral than is typical of the style. There is some breadiness to the beer along with noticeable clean pale malts. There is a bit of waterishness to the beer in the finish and less the peppery bite I was expecting. There is some lemony florals in the finish as well, and only the slightest puckerishness in the aftertaste. As the beer settles, there is more pungent lemony flavors, and a bit more dry tartness in the finish. This is a decent drinking beer, but not the best pilsner as advertised.","albern","Feb 12, 2008"

The most attractive small-bubbled, crisp carbonation and texture enhance the soft mineral aspects that pair with the hay-like pils malts to create an ultimate tool for refreshment. The perfect flavorful quaffer. Good base malt also ensures a certain roundness, medium bodied lets say, slightly honeyed though not biscuity. It escapes the usual oiliness of many czech pils to capture the essence of fresh hops, the vibrant spiciness, highly leafy and floral, yet intense in a way that cant but remind of citrus. An elegant creation that speaks a whole book about the no compromise approach of those 2 legendary lambic brewers. Full on quality, great ingredients, yet open-minded and creative. I think I do prefer Christoffel Blonde, but I consider this as my 2nd favorite pils for now. Competent punchy bitterness, dry and crisp. A grand hoppy beer like I enjoy them.","Rastacouere","Beers"

Taste full bodied without being sweet and has clean malttaste. Aftertaste is only hops as bitterness is well dosed and stays on the tongue for quiet a while. Remembers of great bavarian vollbier taste and can keep up with them( minus presentation) aswell as with the XX bitter and Hexapoda.","paterlodie","0"
