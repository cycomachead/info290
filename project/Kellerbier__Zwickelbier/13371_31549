Not a strong smell to it, but the hop flavors are definitely in there. Very crisp and refreshing with a little hop aftertaste.

This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice balance of citrus and grassy qualities.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 30, 2013"

The smell was modest but with a sweet malt aroma and light aromatic hops. The taste was sweet up front followed by some aromatic noble hops flavors. Modest bitterness as it is overpower somewhat by the sweet maltiness. The flavor of alcohol could also be discerned. The finish left the taste of hops together with some grainy malt. The body was medium to medium-full with low overall carbonation feel and a sweetness throughout. Hops lingered in the finish. This was not an unpleasant beer, but unlike any German Kellerbier I have had in Germany, and too strong and sweet to be a Pils, though it could fit into the Imperial Pilsner category. I had this beer on my Wants list for over 5 years, and I am glad I finally got to drink a bottle.","UncleJimbo","Jun 07, 2013"

Softly sweet, doughy flavor upfront. Citrus, honey, and plenty of floral hops quickly balance the malt. Drying, bitter, and crisp which increases the drinkability, despite the heavier-than-usual mouthfeel. Not quite as good as I hoped it would be, but still pretty tasty and interesting.

I get a very clean lager yeast and bread/biscuit malt flavor with a nice array of hops behind it. The hops stray towards the herbal, spicy spectrum and complement the clean malt aroma. The taste is okay. Both of the elements of the aroma are still present but I just didn't feel like they integrated very well. Still good, just not as integrated as I was hoping for. The mouthfeel was good, like a good lager it was very drinkable.

Drinks like a few double pilsners that I've had, on the less dry side of that spectrum. The pour creates a sculptable head and laces the glass like crazy as you drink it down. Heavy on the saaz hops. Alcohol content is very well hidden for the strength. Anyone who likes the pale lager style and wants some deeper, richer, toastier flavors should have a fine time with this beer.","ommegangpbr","Oct 20, 2011"

Big, fluffy head, with a hazy, golden body underneath. Has a bit of floral, spicy scent. Hmm. This is an interesting taste, unlike any beer I've ever had. Kind of an earthy, pungent grassy taste. Not sure what kind of hops bring that to the table. There's a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is standard. Not too thick, slightly carbonated. This is pretty tasty, but probably not my favorite type of beer. I might have one every now and then. I'd like to try more of Voodoo's beers.","DrStiffington","Jul 24, 2011"

It is not an unenjoyable beer, it is about what you'd expect from a keller but there is something about that that makes it not measure up in my mind.

Taste is immediately bitter hops. Herbal hop finish. A very subtle cakey sweetness rounds it out although it's really just a background note to the hops. Still it adds a really nice unique note to this beer that I really like. Full bodied and well carbonated. Very easily drinkable. I really love a good pils (or keller bier). And I've enjoyed some other American takes on some of these German styles (like Victory's Prima Pils). This is perhaps the best example of this- really great stuffl.","burnstar","Mar 24, 2011"

Malty flavor in the beginning that leads to lemon citrus hop flavors, a hint of yeast and pine hop finish. A very unique lager that went down very smoothly and easily. Glad I bought more than one.","IronLover","Nov 08, 2010"

Dry qualities from the malt with some lemon and pepper in the finish. It has good flavor, just wish a little more hop flavor from the 50 IBUs.

It's crisp, with a good, light, refreshing taste of grain, which will please the pilsner fan, but a sneaky tingle on the back edges of the tongue that will please the hophead. Unexpected and delicious all around. I look forward to trying this beer again (and seeing of I can come even close to replicating it in my home brew tanks).","Seanibus","Jan 29, 2008"

3.98,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Holy head, Batman. Pours a slightly hazed gold with a massive creme head. Nose is clean and mild. Flavor is heavier on dough than anything with a decent earthy edge and too noticeable a sweet tone on the start. Feel is typical. It is easy to drink and certainly over-carbonated. A bit more hoppy than I would expect, but it's nice enough.","RblWthACoz","Jan 11, 2008"
4.2,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability is good. An interesting beer that reminds me a bit of a strong Pilsner. I like it, and will enjoy this bomber a lot. My only complaint is that I paid way too much money for this bottle. But with that said, will someone else buy me another?","flexabull","Dec 28, 2007"
4.45,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a foggy bronze with a huge fluffy two finger white head that never seems to die down. Stickiness is a thick layer that stays forever. Lots of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell is a spicey yeast aroma with a nice blend of noble hops. Pepper and lemongrass tickle the nose as well. Some buttery biscuit scents make an appearance too. Very complex smell, fresh and clean. Floral hops up front with an underlying yeast flavor. A white bread like taste as well as some citric hop flow over the tongue. A honey sweetness emerges as well as a bit of malt which helps balance this monster quite well. Aftertaste is spicey noble hops, very enjoyable. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a strong carbonation that leaves a dry feeling. I can't say I've ever had a beer like this before. I had New Glarus' Yokel, but Pilzilla has way more flavor. Definitely seek this one out.","BeerTruth","Dec 13, 2007"
4.45,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a very light yellow and slightly watery looking at first, but then some of the sediment falls in and makes it look cool and exciting. Patchy white head, not very Godzilla-like, but a lot like a pils. Odor is soft, of light malfs and lightly spiced hops. Some sweetness on the nose as well, but not detectable alcohol. ooh, but the taste is great. I was expecting a massive, overhopped high alcohol mess of a lager, one of those "American's are awesome because they can make beer styles CRAZY" type of beers. But this is not really that at all. Here, you have a fantastically crafted and tremendously tasty spin on your classic European Pils. Sure, is slightly hoppier and slightly higher in alcohol than your average pilsner, but that's what it claims to be. What it's not is over the top, and i like it. Nicely spiced malt backbone melds supremely well with the hops. Creamy quality and somewhat lemony. Hops linger, but not harshly. Medium bodied. Very drinkable and and extremely pleasant surprize.","aforbes10","Dec 04, 2007"
4.47,12,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very refreshing in the mouth with an aftertaste of just a bit of white pepper to go with the citrus peel hop.","IntriqKen","Dec 01, 2007"
4.45,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: Easily would have enjoyed a second 22 oz. Easily would have enjoyed buying a six pack. Easily would have enjoyed paying less, but certainly worth it. (5.0)","BWH3","Nov 08, 2007"
4.5,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appears an unfiltered golden haze beautiful thick white head chunk even lacing with each sip. Aromatics contain lucious layers of grassy hop bursts mild pine with upfront citrus hops mild skunk but not in an off way. Pale biscuit soft malt tones bring mild sweetness to the party but the hops are shining, a touch of perfume mild honey flow. Flavor mild sweetness flows nicely with a touch honey, sturdy hop bitterness fresh cut grass with citrus peel accents such a well structured pils bigger than most I welcome the kellerbier style this beer brings adding both flavor and texture. Mouthfeel carbonation is adequate flows nicely hop crispness leaves a dryness on the palate, slightly sticky with hops oils. Drinkability by the bomber for sure something that I would love to imbibe on in number, and I plan to.","WVbeergeek","Oct 13, 2007"
4.18,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall, a great pilsner-type beer; in fact, the label calls it a "bastardizded German, Czech, Polish Pils." Highly recommended.","LeftyBWS","Oct 11, 2007"
4.51,13,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"D - Near perfection. The 6.7%abv not noticeable at all. I would call this beer dangerous as I could easily finish this bomber and reach for another. Highly recommend beer and another winner from Voodoo.","jasonm","Sep 30, 2007"
