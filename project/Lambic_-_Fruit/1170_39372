It is nicely balanced with a hint of vinegar, acidic sourness, and bready yeast.  This is my second upland sour, and after years of reading that upland sours are overrated, I did not know what to expect.  I think this brew competes with the best of them.  I would now love to seek out and try more upland sours. The blueberry was kind of a disappointment  but this one is great!","PittBeerGirl","Nov 21, 2014"

4.46,10.1,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"O. An excellent lambic and an impressive strawberry fruit beer. This fruit tends to fail in beer more than it succeeds, making this brew even more impressive. What I most like about this one is that it combines sweet, refreshing notes of strawberry with very tart, acidic, funky notes typical of the lambic style. Upland can chalk up another success in its lambic series.","siege06nd","Jul 06, 2014"

The funk and the sour eclipse the fruit, leaving the namesake strawberry to play a secondary role. If the balance of the fruit and funk were reversed, and the fruit played top bill while the funk was underlying with highlights, this would be a world-class brew, but as it is I'm not sure I'd seek this one out again.","Tsar_Riga","Jun 02, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, strawberry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with super sour malt, strawberry, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great strawberry aroma and super sour flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 01, 2014"

Its really hard to make a sour carry that strawberry flavor really well, but Upland has this one dialed in very well with this new batch of Strawberry Lambic. It really exceeded my expectations, the new batch of Strawberry Lambic will be getting some well deserved attention. My advice on this sour is not to age it at all. This beer is a drink it fresh if you got a bottle of sour beer; I dont see this sour improving with age.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Nov 14, 2013"
4.73,16.8,5,5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Pours a hazy pink/reddish blonde with some offwhite head. The body looks just like a strawberry. Beautiful hue. This beer smells like fresh picked strawberries. The nose jumps out of the glass with some tartness but loads of fruit. The "$6 of strawberries per bottle" pays off. This beer tastes like fresh picked strawberries that are slightly unripe. Great tartness is completely in balance with the fruit and they play well together. Worthy of a second glass at an event with other great sours. Highly recommend this beer. I can't speak to the other batches, but the current batch is fantastic.","PHBoiler","Nov 09, 2013"

This one was shared during the big Upland sour tasting amongst a large group of BAs! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a hazy orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, strawberry, funk, tart, and diaper (NOW THAT’S SOME FUNK!). The flavor was of sweet malt, strawberry, funk, sour, tart, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. Upon smelling this one and picking up on a note of diaper with others in the group agreeing I knew this brew was going to bring the funk. Sure enough, it was rather funky with a nice sweetness from the strawberry to balance it out. A really well put together brew that I would love to drink everyday if possible.","thagr81us","May 30, 2012"

It eventually poured a murky, dark orange in color with a one finger head that laced the glass. It smells of both sweet and tart strawberries. I like it and I'm almost impressed that it doesn't drink like I've heard it to. Perhaps, like the peach that I know was different from bottle to bottle, that this drinks like a solid independent sour. It's actually pretty good. It has ALOT of barnyard funk and a good amount of both sweet and sour strawberry. I'm surprised I like it so much. So did the puppy, who licked it off the floor. This drinks rather dry and tart, appealingly so. It is rather acidic but it's good in the manner it presents itself. Good beer. If only there were more than 450 bottles of it.

And, that being said, a lot of these notes weren't strawberry-esque - the yeast (in conjunction with generic fructose, I imagine) contributes lots of other stone fruits.

Easy flavor with a sugary strawberry finish but not what I would call sweet, funky and tart but not sour. I would love to try a bottle of the base lambic used for these beers or maybe one day an Upland gueuze. The carbonation is a little low but still has a nice feel to it.","ArrogantB","Dec 15, 2008"
4.06,0.2,3,4.5,4,4,4,"My second pour had quite a bit of sediment mixed in by the carbonation as it sat in the bottle. This adds a touch of a yeasty bite to the flavor and a raw, yeasted dough not to the aroma, both of which are not a major player, but contribute to the overall effect of both the nose and flavor. The funkiness of the aroma is much reduced in the flavor (the tartness is much more noticeable in the flavor), but there are some light notes of phenolics, some cotton mouthed mustiness and just a hint of musk. The strawberry character is much more enjoyable than I expected it to be. I am not a big strawberry person, but it definitely adds a nice touch here, especially since it has a fairly soft influence overall.","Gueuzedude","Dec 13, 2008"
3.47,-14.3,2.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Not bad I guess. However, at $16 a bottle, there are much better examples of lambics, with or without strawberries. Based on reviews, this one let me down pretty hard.","SaCkErZ9","Dec 01, 2008"

4.07,0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured from a corked 750ml bottle and served in a tumbler. This beer poured a cloudy, bright orange with some gold highlights and a bubbly head of foam that quickly faded into a ring. The aroma included strong oak and tart strawberries. The flavor was a bit on the sweet side. It was made up of macerated strawberries, oak, and some mild funky notes. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and refreshing. Lightly carbonated. I would have prefered a little more funky sourness, but this was still pretty nice.","mdm46410","Nov 17, 2008"
4.07,0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a very fizzy pale yellow with a lot of carbonation and head (near champagne). Good scent, hints of strawberry with a nice sour aroma. Good taste, nice and sour, not overly malty or hoppy, good traces of strawberry, I just wish there was more fruit in both the taste and the aroma. Goes down fine, if a little rough from the carbonation.","JamesS","Nov 11, 2008"

3.8,-6.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Huber Orchard produces some good strawberries by the looks of this brew, Upland was lucky enough to use some of their fruit in this lambic, nice tart lambic that will probably improve even more on that end because of bottle conditioning, would like to drink again once it gets some age under its belt, recommended","Floydster","0"
4.48,10.6,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a hazy golden red color with a medium sized, pinkish white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of brett, wood, light vanilla, and strawberries. Taste was wild yeast, sour, light vanilla, wood, and a pleasant berry finish. Thanks for sharing John!","egajdzis","Nov 07, 2008"
3.95,-2.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"My first from this brewery, thanks Jon for bringing. It was a great changeup in a series of barleywines. In a word, nice. Fruity cloudy colour with significant white head and lace. The nose is decidely strawberry. Easy drinking, medium mouthfeel. Balanced, with oak and a bit of wild yeast notes.","Sammy","Nov 06, 2008"

4.25,4.9,4,4,4,4.5,5,"This is another great lambic from Upland. The strawberry taste comes in along with the oak and lays on you tongue nicely as it goes down. These Lambics almost leave you wanting more and more after you drink it. I'm not sure if it's the sour tartness or the funk from it. GREAT none the less. It's a shame the total run is only 50 cases a year of each flavor if you're luck enough to get some. The Peach is less it's only 25 cases but this one is worth seeking out and a treat for sure! I had this fresh at the release review is taken from fresh batch!","hrking","Mar 18, 2008"

4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The brewery produced 300 gallons using top fermentation with wild yeast. Conditioned in American white oak casks. Secondary fermentation using whole fruit from Huber Orchards in Starlight, Indiana. This 750 ml corked and capped bottle came from The Keg in Clarksville, Indiana. This brew disembarks from the bottle a slightly hazed golden colored body with a small white head. Active carbonation is apparent in the goblet. A few flecks of spotty lace are left behind. Aroma is sour and acidic with some funky must and strong oak wood tones. Light medium body with a crisp carbonation. Taste is tart and sour, somewhat acidic. Musty oak tones throughout, but the wood is more assertive as it warms. Just a hint of tart strawberries. No added sugars here. Very well done for the style. Rivals many of the better Belgian fruit lambics.","merlin48","0"
