But the taste finishes with a slight tartness, vinegar and a oaky red wine. But overall this is way too sweet for me. Finishes surprisingly clean from the sweetness. I feel like I'm supposed to love this because I love belgian beer, but I just don't. However, if you mix framboise with Hoegaarden you get what's called a "dirty hoe" and that is a nice refreshing beer cocktail.","constantine_272","Feb 15, 2015"
4.24,9.8,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"On tap at the Homegrown Brewhouse in Summerville, SC for Valentines Day. The perfect after-dinner drink for my wife and I, and an excellent companion to the chocolaty Russian Imperial Stout that I've been sipping. Pours in to a 6 oz snifter with an opaque, beet-red hue and 2 fingers of cranberry-cream foam. Quite a sexy looking drink. The soapy lacing and foamy collar add to the allure. The intense fresh raspberry aroma is sweet and tart. A little floral too, with a bit of sour citric character. The flavor is packed with a potent raspberry-candy fruit tartness. The delicious raspberry sugar sweetness is backed by a nice yeasty, malted grain base, reminding you that it is indeed a beer. Suggestions of clove make a subtle appearance, but ultimately the aftertaste is reminiscent of tart raspberry preserves. With a medium body and tame carbonation, it's easy and light, but not thin. Indeed it's a great complimentary texture to the distinct flavors. Personally, I'm not much of a "fruit" beer guy, but this one has always had a place in my repertoire. I enjoy this experience from time to time, and there isn't much I would change about Lindemans Framboise. Excellent dessert beer, or compliment to a host of savory dishes. Split a bottle with your lady instead of wine or champagne. It's delicious!","JohnnyI","Feb 15, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense dark pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart and sweet raspberry, raspberry skin, candi sugar, hay, grass, light pepper, light oak/funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with big authentic raspberry fruit presence, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big sweet and tart raspberry, raspberry skin, candi sugar, hay, grass, light pepper, light oak/funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart/sweet raspberries, raspberry skin, candi sugar, hay, grass, light pepper, light oak/funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness and balance of big authentic raspberry fruit presence, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly syrupy/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 2.5%. Overall this is an excellent sweetened fruit lambic style. All around great robustness and balance of authentic raspberries, candi sugar, and light earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable and flavorful sessionable offering.","superspak","Jan 02, 2015"

3.98,3.1,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of a raspberry Lambic, it had all the aspects that I expect from the style and there were no off flavors.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little cloying, a little sticky, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think the sweetness would start to wear on me after more than one glass, so I think one glass would be a prefect amount for me and it makes for a great dessert beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it's just what i expect from a raspberry lambic.  What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, I think it could be toned just a little.  I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the style.  All in all i was happy with this beer,  it makes a nice dessert beer and I enjoy drinking it.  So far it's my favorite Raspberry Lamic, but it isn't my favorite from Lindemans, I still prefer the Kriek.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Oct 25, 2014"

Smell is full of sweet, fruity raspberry, lightly funky, a bit of cheese rind as well, mix of sugary and tart berry juice is a pretty good description of this. Taste is of sweet berry up front, sugar coated raspberry and raspberry candy, mid palate of jammy berry flavours with a tart fruity aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium bodied and lightly syrupy. A bit too sweet for my tastes perhaps but still quite good for a sweeter lambic something I could drink again easily.","peensteen","Aug 18, 2014"

While my experience with lambics is rather limited, this stands up as the best and most enjoyable one I've had something I could go to time and again.","DenisKolkin","Aug 16, 2014"

Had started off as 3 fingers, quickly faded to just lacings with decent side cling. Aroma was somewhat one note, primarily raspberries, very sweet sugary ripe ones. Very small hint of malt hiding in the back. Flavor was slightly sour that shifted to a very sweet ripe berry flavor. Definitely beneficial to consume at the suggested temperature, would be a bit to sweet at warmer temps. Coated nicely, a bit of carbonation that tingled the tongue. Not overly thick, but boarding on being so. A nice change up beer.","mountdew1","Jun 16, 2014"

4.01,3.9,4.5,4,4,3.75,4,"This is probably the framboise or fruit beer for that matter with which all others within the style are compared. It was served on tap with a giant head that fell quickly. The color is magnificent--a pinkish ruby color. The smell is only about the raspberry and is almost medicinal. The taste has a good balance of sweetness and tartness, but it has very much of both and has a cough syrup quality to it. The carbonation makes it similar to drinking Champaign. The mouthfeel is smooth but the pounding sweetness makes this one a little difficult. As someone who loves raspberries, I can say I love drinking this beer, but it's too sweet to have more than one, and it doesn't taste much like beer at all. I didn't notice any hop flavors. It can work as a dessert beer but is probably not something to have with a meal as it's going to distract from the flavors of the food.","DeFaz","Sep 01, 2013"

3.89,0.8,4,3.75,4,4,3.75,"the standard of fruited beers here really. this is the best of fresh raspberries, Belgian yeast, and drinkability. it pours a bright red almost medicinal color, with a foamy pink head and a lot of bubbles. the nose is decidedly berry heavy, fresh and tart as they are sweet. Belgian yeast completes the fermentation of most of the sugar here, leaving a beer that is brightly summery and plenty drinkable, without being overdosed on sugar. all of the lindemans stuff is very authentic and tasty, but this might be their most classic and best put together offering. a great brew for a celebratory toast, weddings for example. the champagne carbonation makes it sing, I like this a lot, but the low abv makes it hard to cop a buzz on this alone. its also nice in a beer blend with a nice Belgian wit in just under 50/50 proportions.","StonedTrippin","Aug 05, 2013"

As this is my first go with the style, my scores are somewhat arbitrary. The whole concoction on the surface really reminds me of a flavored cider or sparkling wine, but with much more tartness. This is nothing at all like any other beer I have tried, and I would have to be in a certain mood to go for all these sweet and sour notes over the bitter and roasted notes found in traditional beers: all the well as this beer is ridiculously expensive ($6 for the bottle).

The nose, on the other hand, was very heavy with a strange syrupy sweetness that had real notes to it, but made for a strange overall blend.

Some of the bad reviews on BA may be due to how it is fermented: in open casks naturally, not in a controlled environment. Because of this, not every batch will taste the same. But I haven't had a bad one yet. After enjoying this stuff for quite some time, I was surprised to learn of its low alcohol content. One glass has always given me a buzz, and let's just say I can drink A LOT.... But anyway, it tastes like a thick, tart raspberry lemonade, with no hints of alcohol or yeast. Very sweet, but very tart. I love it. This has always been a compromise for me too, when entertaining ladies; I hate white wine, and most girls like this stuff just as much if not better, thank god.","Cerberus","Dec 10, 2012"

The mouthfeel is better and the sweetness is refreshing, rather than sickening and overwhelming. This was my first lambic and I really enjoyed it - something nice to drink early in the day or when you need something dessert-like and quenching.

The nose is the definition of a raspberry bomb. Nothing but fruit aromas coming out of the glass. It's nice and all, but it's just a little too one note for my taste. The flavor doesn't offer any more complexity, it's nothing but wave after wave of sweet raspberries. It's really missing the funky aspect to most framboises that lend them most of their depth. The initial impression is nice, but after a few sips of all that sweetness I find myself craving there to be something more to it. The body isn't dry enough as far as I'm concerned, though the carbonation has a nice effervescence to it. I don't mind Lindemans Framboise as an after dinner pairing with dessert (it goes very nicely with cheesecake), but standing on its own as a beer it just doesn't hold a candle to the more traditional interpretations of the style.","axeman9182","Oct 05, 2012"

I've had it both on tap and from the bottle, not much difference to me. I like the sweetness that doesn't taste fake but I can only drink 2 or 3 before the sweetness becomes overwhelming. Seems to have an above average amount of carbonation, which I enjoy, but doesn't feel like it's too much. Overall a very good interpretation of a sweet raspberry lambic, hence the reason it's one of the most popular and easy to find ones as well.","darktower","Oct 02, 2012"

5,29.5,5,5,5,5,5,"This is probably one of the most beautiful beers that I have ever encountered! It pours with a lovely finger of fuchsia head with great retention. Color is a pretty beet-red with NE-quality clarity. Nose smells of real raspberries, not esters developed in a laboratory. Raspberries have an inherent tartness that imparts itself well in both beer and wine. This smell reminded me of my late paternal grandmother's backyard red raspberry bush that yielded wonderful fruit when I was growing up. Mouthfeel was soft, bubbly and the fruit flavor was tremendous! I could close my eyes and imagine having pie or preserves. The tartness was a welcome treat on a hot, humid summer afternoon, quenching any existing thirst. Finish was tart, raspberry and simply delicious. I would not recommend an entire bottle by yourself, but shared or a glass on-tap is phenomenal. I have seen it used to tremendous success in foods, especially desserts. This is simply a wonderful fruit beer.","woodychandler","Aug 01, 2012"

Reminds me of sweet raspberry juice that is syrup based. That being said, I still really enjyoed it, and would definitely have it again.

It smells almost like fruit punch, with nice sour raspberry waftings. It tastes almost like a raspberry soda, very sour and tart, with the crisp bite that you get from eating a raspberry. The ‚Äúframboise‚Äù is ever present in this beer. I taste no hops, and few malts. This is mostly just raspberry. Its mouthfeel is harsh and tart, giving the mouth a cringing feeling and leaving a very sweetly tart after taste, almost as if I had eaten a Sweettart‚Ä¶ Overall it is sweet and fruity and sour, and actually easily drinkable.","Maxwell","Jun 29, 2012"

It is a beautiful dark garnet red, it smells like you crushed a bunch of raspberries in front your nose right before you put them in your mouth, and it's not watery (like most similar beverages). Very much like raspberry champagne. On top of this, there's a pleasant tartness to balance the sweetness (but it's still pretty sweet). If you appreciate fruity beers, I would strongly suggest this.","gaugebozo","May 18, 2012"

I get a grapefruit bready blend with wheat and cherry chocolate somehow hidden in the mix. It‚Äôs light bodied but has a solid, frisky feel with a magical carbonation that works overtime without suggesting soda pop. A classy, fruit brew with tasteful sweetness.

Pours a bright purple red with a nice 1 inch raspberry head, some lace. Smell all fruit raspberry, apple, and cranberry. Taste is that, raspberry being most prominent and it is surprisingly nice. Body is good, not familiar with this style, except for Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic. Lots of life and kind of bitter, but pretty easy to drink.

Enjoyed it very much with my friends and family on-tap(the ladies loved it);then bottles. Pours a light-hued wine red with red-tint head and absolute never-ending lacing. The pour and appearance indicative of malts of character integrated with the fruit; not just added. A sorbet smell and great sweet-sour taste of raspberry and the unmalted wheat comes out in the pleasant mouthfeel. An effervescent and tart finish makes dessert unnecessary.

3.59,-7,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3," This tastes more like simulated kool-aid than lambic. The fruit flavor is not artificial in fact it seems very fresh, but the sugar component takes away some of the acidity that you expect from this style. The carbonation is good for letting that go in the finish and there is some mild wood flavors which are pleasant in there too. Overall it is a poor excuse for a lambic compared to some of the finest -Cantillon for example. The acidity is so low and the yeast contributes very little to the taste.

Has a nice raspberry sweetness to it, but the amount of carbonation in this lambic balances the sweetness very nicely. Many fruit beers are so sweet and have very little carbonation to balance out the sweetness, so they just feel so heavy and the sweetness is almost unbearable. Not the case with this beer. It is very light and refreshing. Nice Job Lindemans","clint1019","Aug 20, 2011"
3.7,-4.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 2" pink head. Dark body looks pretty much like raspberry syrup. Smells mildly of raspberries but nothing else. Taste is pretty strongly of sour raspberry and it's strong enough to strike me as syrupy. Raspberry lovers must go nuts for this, but to me this is more raspberry syrup than it is a beer. It's interesting that compared to their Kriek scores in BA the Kriek scored higher among the BA management than the BA users, and the Framboise had it reversed. I'd side with the BA management. I think the Kriek is a little more interesting, whereas this example is pretty much just fruit syrup.","MoreThanWine","Aug 18, 2011"

Raspberry candy in the nose, and and the raspberry overtakes any other flavor that might be present, so basically the fruit sweetness is the only thing you get.

A small bit o' minor tartness pervades, but the sweetness beats it back down into submission. Still, I love how this stuff tastes. Oh yes. The body is a nice medium, with a light carbonation and a sticky, syrupy feel. Overall, this stuff can be very addictive. I find myself hard-pressed to stop sipping once I have begun.

The flavor is pretty much the same story. This has the taste of raspberry, it's tart like juicy juice. I really hardly consider this a beer, but it is what it is.

As for taste, what more can you say but how much raspberry can you fit into a beer? I gave it a 4.5 because it is so raspberish it almost isn't beerish.

Raspberries, raspberries and more raspberries in the nose, bracing blow of sour lemon, suggestion of watermelon as well, if you really focus there's a peat moss, lichen foresty aspect but then it's back to the raspberries. Full-bodied, the sourness and acidity are really what makes it of the high quality it is, keeps things moving at a brisk pace and shaves off excess sweetness. The raspberry flavor concentrated and ripe more than sugary for sugary's sake. Again, the lemon edge helps frame the fruit nicely. Lemongrass and alfalfa notes odd but welcome.

Taste is not as sweet as scent dictates, more tart rasperry. Still a presence of candied sugar however. Hints of funk and hay in the very back. Body is somewhat inconsitent... ample carbonation in the begining makes it medium boied and crisp. Towards the end, the carbonation thins out and its almost syrupy.

Looks like grape juice. The aroma is sweet yet tart, grape juice with the raspberry tartness; dead on fruit juice. The taste has a beautiful raspberry sweetness and tartness. This is raspberry concentrate. Like all Lindemans the fruit sweetness dominates but has a balancing tart offset. This is crazy sweet but damn delicious. The feel is that of a nice moderate body, with fizzy carbonation, very very sweet but with enough fruit tartness to prevent from being cloying.

Medicinal phenols and raspberries in the nose, also some light fruity alcohol, but thats about it. The initial taste is very sweet and very tart. Somewhat like pairing a traditional lambic with a raspberry puree; only a very faint pale malt sweetness can be found. Dry aftertaste; possibility of hop flavor but certainly lacking in bitterness and the tart lactic bite is not enough to keep the flavor in balance. I can appreciate what the brewer's were attempting here, but I would still like to detect a beer in there somewhere. High carbonation and medium to full body. This might have been more agreeable if lighter in body, but the thick, unchecked sweetness is distracting even though it dries out quickly. Finishes with a suggestion of hops and fairly dry. The drinkabilty is good if you like your beer devoid of malt and hop character, visciously tart, and dripping with raspberry marmalde sweetness.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 18, 2007"

But let me say opening this brew left no doubt what was the fruit in this Lambic! First, there's a cap, and it's on there. That off, there is the cork. Pull that, and it's the march of the raspberries. This beer pours up a nice full dimpled and frothy head, dies away to some nice lacing. I don't really know how to describe the mouth feel, it's not like I could relate it to another beer. Think raspberry soda. They were not shy on the carbonation either. I belched. Immediately. A couple of times. A desert beer, if you will. Maybe with a nice cheesecake. I think it's the first beer I ever had I might call amusing. I would not want to do a lot of this -- it's actually hard to call it beer and the alcohol content is quite light -- but I'm glad I tried it, and doubtless will do another from time to time.","mobius024","Dec 27, 2006"

Sweet raspberries throughout. Ends with lingering sweetness and raspberry goodness. The taste is not incredibly sour, but you can feel the acid the entire time and into the stomach (I took antacid beforehand). After a few sips, I manage to notice a bit of mustiness in both the smell and taste. Very likeable, although the acid definitely causes problems for me.

Hiding under the fresh raspberries is a bit of barnyard earthiness. The finish is quite short with just a little tartness lingering.

Less fresh, but more musky. More of a Flander's red flavor and texture in general. A little more dusty, woodsy, vineous, and earthy; maybe from the cork and complex cellering.

This Lambic tasted like it was bottled yesterday: fresh, bright, intense and flamboyant. At 4% ABV, there is plenty of room for more alcohol within. With the generous residual sugars onboard, a bit more Alcohol would probably help round out the flabbiness here.

Raspberry syrup again dominates the middle; some melons poke through. Feel is full and spritzy. Finish is a little tart, but is again overpowered by sugary raspberries. This is just kind of gross.

The only thing that I have against the beer is that it is a tad too sweet. It has a good tartness that balances it out, but if that was taken down a notch this beer would be incredible. It tastes like a carbonated rasberry sorbet. To be honest it is hard to pick out the malt or hops flavor, but that is to be expected in a lambic. This is worthwhile to try. It is a good beer to bring over for dessert at a dinner.","GeoffFromSJ","Nov 27, 2003"

The lambic acidity blends perfectly with that berry tartness. The feel is thin, acidic, and crisp, bringing a light puckering sensation with it.

A wine like ruby purple, very bubbly with a quickly dissipating head. A deep bitter raspberry aroma with loads of bubbles arising to tickle the nose.

Attractive, but not stunning. Nose is an inviting bouquet of raspberry essence and some sugary notes. Flavorwise, a rush of tart raspberry flavor marries well with some sweet sugar notes. Almost becomes cloying compared to other, traditionally unsweetened lambic beers. Bubbly, effervescent mouthfeel lends well to this beer, though it could be improved.

The flavor is astonishingly full of candyish sweetness and tart/sour raspberry with minimal characteristics from the lambic - some mustiness is all that really stands out. Obviously, this is geared toward the masses. The fruit is somewhat authentic in character, but it's also clearly overdone. It finishes semi-sweet with a splash of acidity and then some sticky sweetness left in the mouth. Makes a great apertif or after-dinner drink.

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Well I agree with those that have difficulty classifying it as a beer.  After having removed the cork and smell the aroma, it comes across as a cross between a beer and a dessert wine.  Has a good color and aroma.  A different drink to have that I would recommend like some wines as an after dinner drink.","Wildman","May 25, 2002"

4.24,9.8,4,5,4,4,4,"The first thing that hits you after getting through the beer's cork is the strong smell of raspberries.  The smell itself is intoxicating.  This beer is very light with a very fruity and slightly sugary character.  Nice raspberry purple/red color.  Definitely not a beer for every occasion but a good aperitif.","jreitman","Apr 09, 2002"
4.27,10.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I was always skeptical of fruit beers until I had this. At first it looked like carbonated grape juice until the aroma hit my nose. My first taste was one of suprise and delight.This beer actually is really really good. I would not drink this everyday but for an appertif  it is perfect.","Reverand","Apr 06, 2002"
2.65,-31.3,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Cool cap/cork combination. Pours like sparkling wine, with the same head. To me, at first this tastes like carbonated raspberry cough syrup.  As it warms up, and I get used to it, its better.  Its aroma is deep, very earthy, raspberry, that carries through to its taste.  Absolutely not to my taste,  but I think that's me and not the beer, and I've tweaked the numbers accordingly.","jackndan","Apr 05, 2002"
4.01,3.9,5,4,4,3.5,4,"I had this on draft at a tavern in Atlanta and it tastes more like what I would imagine a rasberry cider would taste like. There is very little of the typical beer flavor here. Maybe it's because I had it on draft, but I experienced little of the bitterness or bad smells that I have heard in complaints about this beer and other lambics. You've got to go into this beer with an open mind or it's going to catch you off-guard. Still, not as good as the La Trappe Trappist Ale I had in the same sitting.","aracauna","Apr 04, 2002"
3.8,-1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Wow...what the hell, holy raspberries batman, it smells like my Grandmom just came over with a bucket of raspberries. ( which she really does). A very good beer of this style. Very drinkable. Not really my personal taste but I can definately appreciate this. I could never drink this brew everyday, but cool change of pace. Once or twice a year sounds about right. Overall a very cool brew.","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 13, 2002"
3.5,-9.3,4,4,3,3,4,"Nice balance between sweet and tart, but the raspberry flavor was so overwhelming that I could not get much sense of what else might be going on with the underlying malt.  Not that I'm complaining that a raspberry lambic tasted too much of raspberries, but I would have liked a little more dimension.","Brent","Oct 31, 2001"
3.55,-8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Very aromatic with lots of sweet tart fruit both in the nose and on the palate. Addictively good if you like syurpy fruit flavours ... a beer I would have at a morning brunch.","Jason","Sep 06, 2001"
