There's a tiny bit of funk on the back end, but overall it's just tart acid balanced by sweet peaches.  Very nice.","mynie","Feb 23, 2015"

4.16,1.2,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy, vibrant light orange topped by a thin white head and big flocks of white sediment stirring around the bottom. The nose is vaguely funky, with light tart peach notes, a hint if puke, and some grain. It's a tart and grainy sour with fantastic peach flavor, some lemon & Granny Smith apple, a great malt backbone, and subtle fruitiness that lingers in the finish. For an upland, this is a very approachable, medium bodied, reasonably carbonated, and drinkable sour (not super acidic) that amplifies a subtle peach characteristic and maintains a great grain and yeast presence alongside. I'd highly recommend this beer and would rank it as one of my favorite uplands.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 28, 2014"

Decently harsh. Taste. Wow! Huge sour up front. Hits you in the corner of your jaw. Finished with an amazing peach flavor. One of the most fruit forward flavored lambics I've ever tried.

4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled on 10/12/10, Batch 42-90. This bottle was a slow gusher when I opened it. Served in a flute, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with some floaties, and about an inch carbonated white head that fizzled away quickly. There isn't much lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like tart and sweet peaches, lemon peel, and musty, earthy funk. I think the taste is similar to the aroma. The sour/tart flavors are stronger than the sweet peach ones, but the tartness isn't overpowering at all. As the beer warms up, the peach flavors really come out more. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and well carbonated. I think it's a good brew, I liked it. $19.79 a bottle at Liquor Barn.","bluejacket74","Dec 15, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, peaches, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. I found it quite odd that there was no sign of the peaches in the aroma on this one.

It reminds me of dried fruit through and through. The bitterness is both efficient and appealing. The flavor is between apricot and peach, which is confusing. I do like it though. It drinks very crisp. The carbonation is actually perfect, especially considering it began to foam and then that was it. This beer was good but probably not $20 a bottle good.

3.42,-16.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Definitely a bit of a disappointment, this is not bad though, it just could be so much more. The lack of sourness, much less bracing acidity, one expects in a Lambic is a glaring hole, and there isn't even any barnyard funkiness to up the complexity here. The lack of carbonation hurts a bit more, but would not really have been an issue if the other Lambic characteristics had been captured. Actually because of the lack of sourness and funk, the carbonation issue becomes all that much more of a problem.","Gueuzedude","0"

It's remarkably delicious and the Peach is so perfectly potent that I almost can't believe it. If you have a bottle of this you may want to sit on it for a couple months just to be sure it's fully carbonated. My score really doesn't reflect how good this beer is because Mouthfeel and Appearance have to take hit. Huge thanks to Matt for the opportunity!","younger35","0"
