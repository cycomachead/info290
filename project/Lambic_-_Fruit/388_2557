4.54,5.6,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Raspberry and cherry nose, wet compost, over ripe fruit and citrusy tartness. This looks like a sparkling rose with foam and combines the delicate champagne bubbles with the beer body and fluffy, rapicly dissipating pinkish white head. It is tart, lemony, fresh, funky with raspberry and cherry flavors. Very refreshing.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

4.71,9.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: It's Cantillon, so the chances of this one being a duffer were always going to be pretty low. Bear in mind, though, that this is not your typical framboise - if you're after something sweet and/or syrupy then you're most definitely in the wrong place. On the other hand, if you're a fan of gueuze or sour beers in general then this is worth the asking price and then some.","interzen","Feb 26, 2015"

4.93,14.7,4.75,4.75,5,5,5,"Poured from a 750. Pours the color of pink grapefruit super high carbonation and a large fizzy inflated head. Beautiful looking beer. Smell, tart raspberry , small amount of funk, little barnyard,  fruit esters and berry. Taste, powerful crisp tartness overwhelms  your tastebuds followed by raspberry and a hint of sweetness. Quickly swept away by mouth watering and tart bite lingering.amazing. not too sweet , an epic sour.mouthfeel , a luxury level equal to champagne.  Full luscious and almost stinging carbonation that arouses the sour flavor to no end. Overall: one of the best beers I have ever had. Best sour hands down.","Fieldzy27","Jan 24, 2015"

Smell has an interesting dynamic as the sweet raspberries intersect with that distinct Cantillon funk. A little odd, but certainly not off-putting. Some lemon zest and oak character add to the complexity. Flavor is a bunch of tart raspberries, a splendid sourness that tickles the cheeks. Oaky dryness on the finish is quite splendid. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style with some lively carbonation. I'm quite pleased with this beer.","jbwimer","Jan 21, 2015"

As with the other beers from this wonderful brewery, this stands atop all others. Very subtle, well balanced, well crafted. I would go out of my way to have this again, and again. If you could rate the label, it would get a 6.0 - there are boobs on the label.","macher0","Sep 22, 2014"

Plenty of dry tartness on the aroma with light raspberries supplementing lots of funky acidic Gueuze notes. Flavor follows very tart and funky--much more so than Kriek--with a beautiful supplement of lightly sweet and tart raspberries that don’t overwhelm. Light bodied, very dry and crisp, plus carbonation. This is exactly how a raspberry lambic should be.","BMMillsy","Sep 01, 2014"

Overall this is perhaps the best raspberry flavored lambic I have had-I prefer the way the taste is young rather than some aged versions I tried in the U.S. incredible with juicy dimension and more on the puckering extreme side of sourness yet the dry finish which is crisp from the intense carbonation is refreshing.","Slatetank","Jul 27, 2014"

On the nose, a huge wave of Raspberries, a little bit of wheat and barley and some sour Belgian Funk notes. When you taste this beer, you need to bear in mind all of the sugar has been fermented out. Just like the initial taste, a big hit of Sour Raspberries, followed by some sour and tart Brett (Belgian Funk) notes finishing with some Wheat and Malted Barley and Bready Notes. The beer is Medium Bodied and quite Highly Carbonated. It finishes like a dry white wine. I really do recommend this beer, especially if Sours are your thing! In good weather they're most definitely a treat.","Sam-VW","Jun 14, 2014"

4.54,5.6,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Thanks to Mark for the IP trade! Pours a reddish pink color, with a pretty large white head, with hues of pink in it. This head is just absolutely refusing to go down. The smell is nice, you can pick up the raspberry but it's not overhelmingly juicy. You can also pick up the sourness, lemon, white grapes, and some slightly funkiness. Taste is sour upfront, falls back to a raspberry flavor, but not real juicy, raspberry skin maybe. Also getting some green apple, lemon and a tiny bit of funk. Very nice tartness at the end. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation is great, very effervescent. This is very good, a lot more flavors than just rasberries. I recently had the framboise, which I prefer. The raspberry was so huge in that one, but this is really good, too.","Mikeypnh","May 05, 2014"

Some earthiness but not too funky. Effervescent but full carbonation with slightly viscous feel. Glad to try this fairly fresh but very curious to find out how this would develop over time.

Overall, a mouth-puckering one of a kind beer, but I think I'm still acquiring the taste of sours and lambics. An interesting slow-sipper but I was not expecting this much tartness. Any more tart and it would not be drinkable, like it is calibrated to be right at the edge of tolerance to push you to a new taste, but not push you over the edge into disgust and inability to finish it. So I'll list this one as my current high limit on tart lambics I can tolerate and finish. A good milestone in my continuing exploration of beer.","damndirtyape","Jan 26, 2014"

Fortunately, Rose de Gambrinus lives up to the hype; I thought it was a very good framboise. The sourness is balanced with the other flavors in a way that some other sours I've had haven't been - I can see why Cantillon is considered to be one of the best.","katalijne","Dec 31, 2013"

Fragrent raspberries and sour funk mix well in the aroma, hinting at the sour flavors to come. Almost puckering sourness right off the bat leads to more well blended, earthy, dry raspberry and and funky flavors. Very complex and hard to describe. The sourness lingers and puckers just a bit more as it hits the back of the tongue. I usually avoid "fruit beers" but I knew this one would be different and it was well worth the price.","ericj551","Aug 30, 2013"

Probably not, but it's an excellent treat to celebrate my 600th review.","Immortale25","Jun 23, 2013"

Cantillon never disappoints, and their most popular raspberry-centric beer is definitely a home run.","tectactoe","May 28, 2013"

Puckering though not extremely sour in the scheme of all things Cantillon. A nice aperitif to be sure, first time I had this it seemed more sour years ago... Chalk it up to a threshold shift in sour tolerance I guess, though batch variation is a possibility too. A classic framboise.","emerge077","May 11, 2013"

4.32,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/20/2011. Pours lightly hazy red-orange color with a 2 finger foamy pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry juice, sour apple, cherry, hay, straw, leather, pepper, clove, oak, funk, white vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and big complexity of tart fruit notes with barrel and yeast character; and great strength. Taste of big tart and sour raspberry, sour apple, raspberry juice, cherry, hay, straw, pepper, clove, oak, leather, oak, funk, light vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Good amount of tart fruity acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, sour apple, cherry, hay, straw, pepper, clove, funk, oak, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor balance of fruit, yeast, and barrel flavors with big complexity; good balance of acidity and sweetness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, acidic, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Acidity is moderately high, but not overwhelming. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic raspberry lambic! Great balance and big complexity of fruit, barrel, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink despite the fair amount of acidity. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Mar 18, 2013"

Poured ruby red with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, funk, diaper, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, funk, tart, sour, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I still stand by the fact that this is one of the best lambics of this genre out there. I have had this one multiple times and have just now got around to reviewing it. I have easily crushed multiple 750 mL bottles of this in the past and will likely do so any time the opportunity presents itself. An absolute must try if you have not done so before as I know you will absolutely not regret it.","thagr81us","Oct 18, 2012"

However, when made like this, they're pretty hard to turn away from. This is an extremely complex beer. Not for the faint of heart, and goes to show that you don't need to necessarily brew something with a high ABV to nail your palate to the table with oppressive and intense flavors!","magictacosinus","Nov 07, 2011"
3.75,-12.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall – I was not impressed with this lambic. I shared this with my father because his favorite fruit is raspberries and he tends to enjoy other lambic/sours/gueuzes I shared with him. We both did not care for this. It honestly had a raspberry flavored seltzer water feel to it. It wasn’t horrible, just didn’t live up to my expectations.","SpdKilz","Nov 04, 2011"

4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I have to admit, I was expecting loads of raspberries to dominate the aroma and palate here. Instead, the raspberries are certainly just part of the overall beer, something that still was very enjoyable. It's not sweet, but straight up funky and tart. I'm glad I've got more of these in the cellar.","ShanePB","Oct 27, 2011"
4.24,-1.4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours ruby with a ring of white/rose tinted frothy foam, champagne like carbonation. Looks nice. Smells like sweet funky raspberry, earth and horseblanket, and some cherry. Taste is similar raspberry, cherry, red fruit; some mineral and herbal (rosemary?) notes coming through at the back end, with a short water and tart finish. Nice tartness but not puckeringly so, and coats the mouth to leave a nice long finish. Medium-high carbonation, medium-light body, nice crispness. Overall, this is a refreshing, bright beer with an intermediate tartness which makes this pretty drinkable. Great palate cleaner between, say, bites of greasy pizza.","pmarlowe","Oct 26, 2011"
4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a beautiful orange/ruby color with a finger of pink foam. No lacing. The nose is rasberries and sweet, acetic funk. Taste opens with notes of ripe red berries. A pucsourness tartness follows bringing barnyard funk and wet horse blanket with it. The finish is more pucker and acetic tartness with a lingering sour berry aftertaste. Feel is light and super carbonated which adds to the experience. I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap at Pizza Port this afternoon. Overall a very enjoyable brew from Cantillon. Great berry flavor with a nice funkiness and satisfying sour characteristics. Wish this was more easily attainable here in SoCal. Recommended.","Sideswipe","Oct 25, 2011"

4.08,-5.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall - My first fruit lambic, so my opinion may be skewed. The raspberries integrated nicely, but brought a strong tartness to the drink.

4.15,-3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Rose de Gambrinus pours red, a shade or two lighter than raspberry, and opaque. There are about two fingers of very cool looking pink tinted foam capping the beer and displaying solid head retention. Lacing is left in thick rings around the edge of the glass, and all in all it's a very good looking beer. The nose is very barnyard funky, though it also packs a solid raspberry punch. A bit of sour twang is very much left as a background/ancillary note.The flavor turns up the sour, reins in the funk, and dials the raspberry back almost to zero. It's still pretty tasty, I just wish the raspberries had a little bit more presence in the beer. The body was very dry/light, with a nice carbonation that stopped just a bit short of spritzy. Aside from the relative lack of fruit I really enjoyed Rose de Gambrinus. I don't know how old the keg was, I'll probably try to get my hands on a relatively fresh bottle sometime to see how pronounced the raspberry is there.","axeman9182","Sep 26, 2011"

Light acetic acid, some sweetness and hints of lactic in there too. Taste is dominated by sour raspberries, mild acetic as well. Hints to some phenols and funkiness. Puckering mouthfeel from start to finish, but not overwhelmingly so. High carbonation, and raspberries linger on the palate. Some acetic acid lingers in the back of the throat. Overall some great raspberry taste, quite nice through and through - an easily re-visitable lambic.","liamt07","Aug 30, 2011"
3.85,-10.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Medium bodied and firm. Quite highly carbonated, spritzy. Long and dry fruity and earthy finish.

Cantillon never brews a beer without tons of complexity and the most DOMINANT characteristics of which fruit, flower, or ingredient they are trying to promote in their beer.

Tastes like sour berries - tart like mad! some musty / even medicinal qualities in the finish. The acidity and sourness makes the mouthfeel unique - not a tom of carbonation - but seems right. This is a cool drink - I waited a long time to try it and I am very happy with it. Not sure what I would pair with it but it is very good stuff on its own.","MUSHROOMCLOUD","Aug 06, 2011"

4.18,-2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O: When you add everything together and add in the fact that this is a 5% ABV beer, it's tough to find much fault in this beer. It is session-able and delicious and the perfect accompaniment for a hot summer day (or night).","cccarson","Jul 26, 2011"
4,-7,4,4,4,4,4,"The mouth needn't terry long before it is slammed by raspberry tartness. Incredibly sour, Rosé De Gambrinus soaks itself into the palate and at the same time causes it to implode in a puckering, funky vinous burst (surprisingly it doesn't tear away at the enamel like some sour beers). Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and the thin body does well to support the flavor. Overall, a great Lambic, but a bit too bracingly tart to drink much of it.","wagenvolks","Jul 18, 2011"

Overall, this is a sweeter Cantillon and enjoyable just like the rest. Less funk and all that "horseblanket" jive, but that does not detract from this great beer. I only wish the carbonation would hold.","Blanco","Jun 25, 2011"
4.11,-4.4,5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"O: very good and fun beer. Not too sour, and very approachable for the noob to sours. Although I cited many of the things I think are nuanced here overall it is like a gueuze of hi order with raspberries mashed up in it. Good stuff.","harrymel","Jun 22, 2011"
4.52,5.1,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"750ml bottled June 17, 2010. Pours a GORGEOUS ruby pink color with a large light pink head that disappears very quickly. The carbonation to this lambic is fizzing very loudly like soda. Scent is straight up funky as all hell with amazing raspberry aromas and vinegar. The funkiness in the aroma is just amazing on this one. Taste is initially barnyard funk with some hay. Then immediately, I get sour lacto flavors with some nice Brett character. Then comes the fist full of raspberries right to the face. This raspberry flavor is amazing how it takes over the pallet without being too sweet. The sourness reigns throughout. Finishes with some lovely oak flavors and more raspberry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and soda-like carbonation. Could be a little less carbonated. Finishes nice and dry. Drinkability is very high.

The raspberries are big on the aroma, dominating the smell. A little bit of funk backing it up but still the sweet berries dominate. Nice. The flavor is not nearly as sweet, the berries are there, but a big mouth puckering tartness takes over and just stays. Pretty much forever. Not super sour but very tart.

The raspberry taste is pleasant but not at all like that in many fruit beers or in wine; instead of a deep, jammy taste there's a taste more like a tea made from dried raspberries. This should help it match with any kind of food that goes with a young geuze rather than with food that goes with raspberries. Overall, it's quite refreshing and the acidity cleanses the palate effectively.","Hachiman","Apr 07, 2011"

Tightly woven brett, just wonderful fruit integration as I expect from these guys. Mouth is way more full on the fruit than I expected, not particularly subtle, though of course dry. Very heavy mineral quality on this, especially on the finish. Raspberries are green and seedy. Not quite as tight in the mouth as I hoped, as the fruit and mineral just kind of linger on. Of course fairly sour and moderately acidic. Still one of the best raspberry beers around, at this point on par with Hommage I believe. In my opinion Bullfrog Frambozen is superior to this (at this age) in it's wonderful, dry subtlety and seedy vanilla quality.","JAXSON","Mar 11, 2011"

The pour of this beer is ridiculously pretty. The head swelled up quickly in a rush of red juices, it quickly rose to a climax then sadly resided, ruining the moment for everyone involved. A thin layer of head stayed around my glass the entire time, but there wasn't any lacing. The look of the beer itself is a bright, gorgeous rosemary; it looks very wine like. The scent is rather faint, but once you really stick your nose in it you get this flowery, raspberry scent that's quite lovely. I also get some sort of 'muskiness' in the scent, a slightly earthy note of contrast. The taste is good, but to be honest I was expecting more, considering this is a real lambic, unlike what I've previously had. I like it, this raspberry, citrusy, tart flavor, but for the ten dollars - I dunno. It drinks easily, however the alcohol is noticeable, so I'm drinking it in gulps. I appreciate the presence of the alcohol in this as it adds another flavor to accompany the raspberry and keep it from being overwhelming. I enjoyed the beer, but for ten dollars I don't know if I'd pick it up again. If you like lambics, buy it drink it, maybe call it again.","FernMaster","Jul 29, 2010"

4.6,7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Rose de Gambrinus expresses great ( i think near perfect) balance between sweet and sour. Rustic barnyardiness dances with sweet raspberry and tart raspberry with a touch of earth and spice in the nose. Taste is acetic at first, which seems to open up my taste buds to receive the essence of the place it was made and the fruit it was made with. A wonderfully expressive beer with a medium body that is supremely refreshing. The balance here seems to be natural as well. Lambics can be too sweet (especially when they are targeted at the American market) and sometimes too sour. This is a gentle and elegant example of one of the most intriguing styles of beer available. Highly recommended.","timtim","Jul 03, 2010"

Very nice mouth puckering sour flavors which consisted of acidic citrus, slight vinegar, oak barrel, barnyard funk and very faint raspberries peep through the sour ingredients. The beer was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation that had a great sweet but very sour and dry finish. lovely sour cantillon signature beer that always makes me happy to have it.

Aroma is of straight moldy basement, rubber band, tart raspberry vinegar, and some unpasteurized funka dunka bunk French cheese. Oh dear, that is sour! Extremely acidic and tart with quite noticeable vinegar. Raspberries have definately dwindled out and the fruit is subtle. I absolutely adore aged lambic and this is a perfect reason why. The 1000 different flavors just reach every corner of my mouth and the sourness is like a bag of raspberry Sour Punch Kids taking over.

This beer tastes fabulous. A great blend of sweet raspberry with a heavy barnyard funk. This beer, like all Cantillon brews, is much more sour than sweet, which I find preferable.

I've had some other lambics (06 Cantillon Kriek) that were far too sour for my taste, but this brew hits the mark for me. Dark pink, salmon-colored brew, very opaque, doesn't have much head at first before it explodes with a billowy light pink head. Aroma is tart and full of raspberries. Sour taste takes over at first before a carbonated fruitiness takes over from the raspberries. Finishes a with a mouth-puckering tart sweetness. A damn sour brew, but it's not so overwhelming that it makes the beer a chore. If this brew were any older, it would probably be too far gone for me.","saintwarrick","Apr 27, 2010"

The taste is similar to the smell, first the sourness comes in kicking and screaming, which is followed by this funky cheesiness and finishes with a nice raspberry sweetness.

Head retention is very good, lacing is decent. Aroma is mostly tart and sweet raspberries, but there's some funk in there too. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, except that the tart and sweet raspberries and funk are all pretty balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. There's also a nice lingering tartness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit thick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, it's refreshing and it's very easy and enjoyable to drink.

The taste of the beer also has a mild sour tartness with is very nice. If the idea of a sour beer sounds unappealing, you should still try this one, as the tartness is not overpowering.

Hard to get many complexities off of it. Acidic, funky, minor fruit edges (barely.) Liquid feel is thicker and slick. Carbonation is minimal as you'd expect with a bit of a bite. This is a rough one to drink. This was the first lambic I ever tried and I am re-reviewing it for the heck of it. I certainly would not suggest a newbie to start with this.

The aroma is unquestionably funky, suprisingly not sour, and has only a hint of raspberries, and surprisingly strawberries. Describing the taste is difficult. The raspberry presense is quite assertive, but so is the brett funk and the acidity, it tastes beautiful. The mouthfeel is pleasent, fizzy and on the thin side, tannic on the sides of my tounge.

Immediately assaulted by scent of fresh sweet raspberry. Overwhelmingly pleasant, and no indicator of the tart monster within. Pour is a light copper, no sediment chunks, and a slight quickly dissipating head. A bit cloudy. Tart. No getting around it. This was my second beer from this brewery. Either my taste for sours has grown, or this is nowhere near the sour potency of their straight lambics. Regardless, it is still plenty sour, to the point of obscuring the raspberry, which continues to strongly assert itself in the aroma. A very pleasant combination. Hard to describe the mouthfeel as the sour taste is quite mouthwatering. Little carbonation and smooth body. Drinkability - not super high, but not a fault of the beer, and certainly good for the style. It is a sipper to be sure, but I had no difficulty finishing a the bottle.

Smells very tart and fruity. Bitter cherries and raspberries. First sip is overwhelmingly sour, with a tart kick of raspberries, stale hay and cherries. Ensuing sips lose the super-sour quality and allow the tart fruits and earthy Brett flavors to come through more. More raspberries, also sweat, sour malt. A very nice and complex mix.

Puckering tartness throughout that really lingered, balanced by berry sweetness and earthy seeds towards the finish. Funk and vinegar filled the rest of the flavour out, but never overpowered things.

Not like juice at all, as some have commented. Did not pour much of a head, and I didn't care. The aroma is not suffering at all. I know exactly what I'm in for. The first sip will be extremely tart. Yep. Puckered me up to the point that I felt like I could send a stream of gleak a good 20 feet across the room. Definitely getting the Raspberry flavor, and it definitely belongs. It's just one component in a world class orchestra of sour funkiness. Like I said, there is nothing fruit-juicy about this. It is what I've come to expect from Cantillon. Nothing but the finest. I can only imagine all the hard work that goes into crafting such a great beer. IMO, it is well worth the price. I can't stop staring at the color of it. It's literally glowing in the glass. This beer is extremely refreshing. I found myself wondering what I could create in the kitchen with some of this. The possibilities seem endless. I wish I had a few cases to experiment with.

4.79,11.4,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"After having a time trying to uncork this (and having the cork partially break with each attempt) I finally poured it into my New Belgium bowl. Looks a mildly hazed and ruddied rosé wine with a whipped egg white head that quickly diminishes. Aroma is a little softer than I would imagine from Cantillon, but that's not to say this is some Lindemans product. Smells acidic and dry with musty, mossy attic. The character of a good lambic is all there, but the acidity is a little stage-shy, which works to allow the subtle fruit to come through in the nose. I taste a lot of acidity at first, but it is not very long-lasting. Wheat comes out a lot in the middle with lemon rind. Finishes very dry, but not completely so, as I get a far-away hint of sweet that accompanies the tart raspberry, which doesn't fully show itself until now. Although I know neither of these fruits were involved in this beer, but I can't help thinking I taste something resembling a mix of strawberry and banana. Mouthfeel feels slightly heavier than most lambics I've had, but that is not to say this is heavy. I think what I perceived as faint sweet in the flavor is what is giving this a little weight in the body. Carbonation is lively and effervescent. Very drinkable. Not a cloying sweet pseudo-lambic, nor is it absolutely bone-dry. Very interesting flavor.","goochpunch","Jun 23, 2007"

4.22,-1.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"A wonderful fruit lambic. Served from bottle into a small water goblet. Amber-pink color owing to use of fruit. White fizzy head that mounds up quickly then drops fast. Aroma is full of lambic "funk" and raspberry-vinegar sharpness, cherry flavor seems less dominant. Flavor is intense -- sour/tart, more "funk", quite puckering & nearly bone dry with some of the fruit flavors remaining. Perhaps a touch of "oak"? Body is light and fizzy. High carbonation levels wash across the tongue as a spray of bubbles on each sip. Refreshing in its way, but I think it unlikely that most people would drink too many of these in a row before the tartness would become overwhelming. Still far more accessible with the fruit flavors than a straight lambic.","jsbrendle","Apr 23, 2007"

Pours a nice hazy rose tinted amber with an extremely modest, yet dense bubbled creamy white head that maintains a stout collar. Smells sour, musty, banana pudding (that i often get from brett) with a touch of vinegar. Very slight sweetness on the entry to the palate, then builds a massive wave of raspberry tinged sourness. This gradually subsides, though never fully, revealing bready slightly nutty undertones beneath the surface. Tremendously complex and difficult to really pin down much of anything. Enormously dry through the finish, just sucking every bit of moisture off my tongue. I suck on each sip like a jolly rancher. Delicious. Very creamy, fine bubbled, light carbonation. Feels medium bodied at the start, but finishes feathery. Drinkability when dealing with a lambic kinda does not apply as it normally would.

Because again, this beer turns out to be among the leaders in it's style. An impressive, thin, savory pink grapefruit juice looking brew with subtle, but persistent head retention. The aromas unleash a juicy, tart scent of grapefruit, red wine, vinegar, and strong lactic acids. Mouth watering and drying at the same time. Faint flavors of pilsner malts are quickly overcome by strong, tart flavors of fruits (berries and cherries) in an almost sweetheart candy powderyness. The airy feel is followed with a sharp tartness (sourness) and a moderate astringency and bitterness. The mouthfeel is as complex as the flavor profile.

The beer poured very smoothe and created a light amber color with hints of pink and a nice pinkish foamy head around the top. A very unique and beautiful pour.

Persistent mousy scent, underscored with bretty, aspirin bitterness. The flavor opens with basement-like funk, layered masterfully with sweetish raspberry fruitiness. Moldy, with horsey, mouse den notes. A hint of stilton and swiss cheese, moving into a raspberry and funky tart finish with restrained brett chewing-on-an-aspirin bitterness. Not quite as sour as some of the real punishing lambics from these fine folks, more of a juicy study on artisanal fruit lambic, without the sugary fruit syrup crap you get in some "lambics". Raspberry keeps presence throughout, transforming with the wandering flavors. Medium bodied, mellower carbonation, very dry in the finish with plenty of acidity in the stomach. Excellent again.","UnionMade","Jul 03, 2006"

Taste begins with a subtle floral flavor and soon carries a nice sourness. Sour cherry, apple, raspberry, are all present, though each not that distinctly as it's hard to distinguish any dominant flavor. The finish yields a dry tang with an earthy flavor.

Wet hay and funky fruit. You can smell the acidity, which wakes up your nose just a bit. Its definitely raspberry. The taste is unabashedly dry. Dry with mouth-puckering sourness and lots of fruit flavor. Drinking this is an adventure. The bottle holds lots of different flavors and experiences.

This fades to a nice raspberry fruity tone with just hints of modest graineyness. Very nice sourness that does not linger at all. Exceptionally tasty brew. I enjoy. Feel is moderate, with a lack of carbonation, leaving some sticky spit in my mouth as it disappears. Very enjoyable. Overall, this is another nice lambic from Cantillon.

For the most part I agree with the general consensus that the fruit addition could be a little more substancial and the sourness is a bit much. Ive had bottles that were so dry and sour that they were bordering on unpleasant. But the past few experiences have been enjoyable and it seems like this has gotten increasingly more "fruit forward" the past year.

The taste is a combination of a very dry chardonnay mixed with raspberry. This beer is not sweet at all. The chardonnay character comes with a bit of pineapple and lemon grass. Very tart.

It tastes great, don't get me wrong, but almost too fruity for my conception of beer, but I'm trying to challenge my palate. Zingy rasperries pretty much take over, though there's a tartness of lemmon and a dusty taste, with a funky sock aftertaste. Dry mouthfeel and despite the sourness this is a fairly drinkable beer. Something still doesn't quite sit right with me concerning this much of a fruit characteristic in beer. There is no hop or malt profile, which I find odd.

Light sweet fruit notes balance out the tartness some but it is very strong. Taste is similar with a punch of tartness up front dominating it. As it warmed and aired out the tartness let some fruity notes creep though as well as a light sweetness. Dry tart finish that took a few sips to get used to. I am still fairly new to the style but I enjoyed the flavor after it warmed and aired out a bit. Mouthfeel was very lively with carbonation and it went down fairly easy.

Tastes of fresh, plump raspberry and blackberries, good oakines, and bite. Tingling, almost feel a bit of numbing to the tip of my tongue. Can feel the tang of it!

Another tart Cantillon aroma, yeasty and cheesy with underlying fruit. Raspberry is underscored but very real, like the woody seeds of wild berries on a bush. Other than that, the Lambic nature is pure and cutting, puckering and gathering in astringency front to back. Like a Habenero pepper, this beer just asks you to wrestle with it. Just slightly softer than the Kriek with a superior overall mouthfeel, flavor not quite as bright. Nice oak and more apparent raspberry peeks out on warming.

Maybe the nudie version is the keeper. In an event, this is a raspberry lambic that bears little if any resemblace to Lindeman's. Poured into a champagne flute, it just explodes into the glass with a billowy white head that dismishes slowly, leaving large beautiful lace patterns all the way down the glass. Raspberry is in the nose, but it's hidden behind funky sour smell and barnyard aromas. The first few sips are almost overwhelmingly puckering. If it doesn't work at first, give it a little time to catch you. You'll be rewarded with an array of flavors: tart raspberry, tangy herbal flavors, and characteristic Belgian yeast. Despite the initial rush of sour flavors, it's surprisingly drinkable: not an everyday beer but certainly worth seeking out for a change every now and then. I'm really getting hooked on Cantillon.

Smell is from another planet. I cannot compare it to many things that I know. It is musty, but with a citric quality that livens it up. Acidic and dangerous-smelling, it dares you to drink it. So I do. A colony of little creatures and their excrement enters my mouth, and it is rather nice. Extremely tart, pretty dry, barn-yardy. Should I be drinking this? Spritzy, big grapefruit and raspberries. Finishes very well, it coates the mouth with just enough tartness to draw you back in for another sip.","waughbrew","Jan 02, 2004"

Well rounded and somewhat soft with some sweetish sour tones of grapfruit, lemon, and raspberry with touches of fresh blooming flowers and there's a mild yeasty mustyness giving off the familiar Cantillon barnyard musk underneath. Taste is souring sweet fruit juices with some nice little puckering of grapefruity acids and light lemon zest. Pretty sharp and quick with a grabbing tartness. There's lots of quick layers of fruity tartness and citrusy souring with some hints to raspberry gaining as it warms and thats when this lambic really did it for me. The raspberry flavors are so well rounded and beautifully done with a great naturalness wrapped in light earthy tones. Very nice. Touches of the yeast add some incredible acidicness along with some oaky tinges too. It has a very pleasant drying finish of raspberry and grapefruit. Feel is beyond lambic fullness, this stuff reaches a new level of quick tart acids and bittering, whew, its a mouth lifter, this stuff will wake you up in a hurry with its full on sourness. It does become much more manageable however as it warms.

Vibrant, acuate waft of fresh, overripe, sugary raspberry with a rounded, blooming floral edge hits the nose at first. Quickly complementing are understated notes of cork and hay, which add a surprisingly subtle barnyard contrast. Bright, appetizing and unexpectedly sweet aromawise. Flavorwise, this brew is a sharp contrast from its nose. Acid, in several forms, dominates. Acerbic, barbed acetic acid grips the palate initially, and slowly tapers. Emerging after a deliberation are mild, grainy soured barley lactic tones and wild yeast must. Tartness continues unhindered late, with ripe, bile like, mixed acid enteric notes mingling with ghostly notes of fruit skin like bitter tannins. Spritzy in mouthfeel and very well attenuated, with a mouthfeel akin to a full bodied Champagne. Finishes arid, with a parching crab apple like nappy bitterness. A complex, challengingly tart brew. Delicious, but not quite as soft on the palate as some other Lambics. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for sending this snappish treat.","marc77","Dec 19, 2003"

The raspberry flavor and notes of oak are incredibly well-integrated in this acidic, sour and truly traditional fruit lambic. Mouth-puckeringly sour and dry to the unenlightened palate, but absolute nirvana for traditional lambic mongers. Lively, bubbly mouthfeel leads to an incredibly drinkable and refreshing fruit lambic for all seasons. No doubt a world classic. Thanks to beerdawg, this led off a fantastic evening of tasting.

I can see my self learning to love this style in time as the acidity is that of say, a loire muscadet and, I can see it performing magic with a plate of mussels and fries, cutting the fat of the fries and making the mussels sing.

4.82,12.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5," Had at the Kulminator in Antwerp. Absolutely stunning. This beer single handedly changed my view of what an aged beer could be. No noticeable hints of oxidation what so ever, I could not even tell that this was a 17 year old beer. I wish now in retrospect that I had a fresh bottle to compare it to. It poured with a lively carbonation, and was still quite cloudy after all this time. It appeared to have a reddish tint to it. The raspberry in the nose was still quite evident, and there was a bit of a musty smell mixed in with the fruitiness. Tasted very complex, dry, quite sour, though perhaps a bit mellowed with age, with a pleasing acidity. A woodiness, funky mushroom character, some tannin, and some slight vegetal flavors to go along with the fruitiness in it. The fruity taste was pretty non-specific, and could not be directly associated with raspberries that was still evident in the aroma. Other than the acidity the fruitiness was definitely the dominating flavor.","Gueuzedude","Aug 20, 2003"

The densely foamy white head rises up above the lip of the glass, and then slowly settles back to a solid inch or more. Tartness dominates the nose with some dry, fruit following, and the hallmark gueuze characteristics right behind it (musty, sweaty, barnyard, leather, citrus). The body is light and airy with it's lively, effervescent carbonation releasing itself as it hits the tongue - foaming up in the mouth, and then fading away on a wave of drying astringency. The flavor overwhelms the palate with intense sourness, hiding its delicate raspberry and cherry flavors, and veiling it's lambic flavors. It finishes astonishingly dry with a wash of astringency that slowly receeds. It has a great depth of flavor (especially within it's tartness), yet it remains surprisingly drinkable once the palate adjusts. The raspberry and cherry add a subtle character that softens it greatly in comparison to a straight gueuze where the more abrasive lambic characteristics stand out; but it's far from fruity.

Taste is tart, tart, tart. I really wasn't ready for this classic lambic characteristic. A bit of spiceyness in the finish, but tart all the way til eternity. Actual raspberry flavor is subdued but there somewhere. That unidentifiable aroma is also present in the flavor, maybe some byproduct produced by the variety of microflora found in this style. Fairly effervescent which make for a decent mouthfeel but somehow amplifies the tartness of this beer. On par for the style, but not for me.

Smelled very dirty, like an extremely dusty attic. Delightfully puckering tartness with a little bit of sweetness after your tongue get accustomed to the attack. I admit I was a bit disappointed because the only fruit I picked up on was while sniffing the empty bottle. From TheLongBeachBum's blending breakdown of this beer I expected a bit of fruit.

It was a little darker in color than that of a bottle that I had in the states and it was much sweeter and less tart. Brewer explained that over time in the bottle it becomes lighter in color and very tart.
