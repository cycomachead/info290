Awesome aroma of big lush blackberry, lots of vinegar and funk, oak, sour. Flavor is big fruity blackberries, sharp sourness, some vinegar notes, oak, dry but not super dry, definite jamminess here. Light to medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, juicy berries yet dry finish. Whoah. This is really excellent. Have heard it is overly sour but I'm not getting that at all. This is just right and on par with some of the best sours I've had, including fruited Cantillon.","BMMillsy","Nov 24, 2014"

Poured a dark purplish-brown color, lively carbonation, with about an inch of rocky off-white head, loaded with chunky bits of blackberry. All right! Sour fruits in the nose, blackberry, apple, a little acetic and lactic. The first thing that jumped out at me was the carbonation. It seemed way too high, and almost made this more soda-like than beer-like. Blackberry was the main player in the flavor department, as would be guessed, tart and tangy, though not overly puckering, lactic, drying. One-dimensional, but what else would you expect from this particular beer? Not a complaint, just an observation. Mouthfeel was light and spritzy, and I feel it lost a bit by being too carbonated, but overall that was just a minor setback. It was a nice beer, and quite enjoyable overall.","Rifugium","Mar 24, 2013"

The aroma smelled of sour fruits with a variety of berry notes observable. In the initial taste, one notes this is incredibly sour. While I was able to enjoy it, I almost thought it was too sour. As it moves to the aftertaste, it becomes progressively more tart and acidic. I had difficulty appreciating blackberries, since I believe them to be sweeter than they are here. The aftertaste further displays quite a bit of natural seedy blackberry flavor. It is easy to tell his is made with real berries.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 26, 2013"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, blackberry, slight sour, and slight tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, blackberry, bitter blackberry seeds, and slight sour. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was quite good to say the least. The flavor really only had one flaw in that the blackberry seed flavor was very apparent throughout and left a bitter taste on your palate after each sip.

I have been on a Lambic tasting spree and have to say I have thourghly enjoyed taste of the Cherry and Blackberry form this brewery. The acidic bite and flavor was there but extremly minimal for me as the funk and blackberry were in the front row. The blackbery and sourness were dull and mixed very well.

It's currently really fruit-forward, but I don't like the berry flavor as much in this one. On the other hand, it does have some funk and acidity.

3.92,-8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle and served in a tumbler. This beer poured a clear, red-tinged orange hue with a one-finger thin head of off-white foam that slightly lasted. A small amount of slippery lacing was left around the glass. The aroma included sweetened berries, wet hay, oak, and a faint sourness. The flavor was also lightly sour, and fruity sweet. Just enough acidity to cut through the sweetness. A hint of oak and clean wheat are also present. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate carbonation. Crisp and aggressive on the tongue. This was by far the best carbonation out of all the Upland lambics I have tried. All in all, another solid beer. Not the funkiest, or most interesting lambic, but still enjoyable.","mdm46410","Jan 01, 2009"
3.62,-15,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Enjoyable in small amounts, the acidity is a bit more than I'd like.","DefenCorps","Dec 27, 2008"
3.26,-23.5,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Taste & mouthfeel: Up front berry flavor, light on the sourness but not sweet either. Balsamic vinegar flavors are pretty prevalent, and I could see the acetic acid doing some bad things to the stomach if large quantities of this were consumed. Fairly simple and straightforward on the whole, very light on the funk and a bit too heavy on the acetic acid. The finish is semi-dry, leaving a trace of berry-like sweetness on the back of the tongue.","largadeer","Nov 23, 2008"
3.68,-13.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"750ml bottle, it bubbled through the cork when I pried off the cap. nice orange-red-pinkish color. Nice fruity, funky, sour smell, butter? The flavor is quite interesting, some fruitiness a hint of sour but barely and a strange buttery flavor. Carbonation is fine and this is easy to drink but this isn't as good as the strawberry or cherry upland lambics.","ArrogantB","Nov 22, 2008"
4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I believe I got these in trade with Travisd13, but I may be wrong- I lost my notes on this one. In any case, I love lambics and for that matter blackberries and I'm very interested in trying this. Pours a reddish brown, maybe even with a splash of purple somewhere in the depths, or is that my imagination? Capped and corked bottle opens with a pop and there is plenty off carbonation but no spewing and the head is slight. Somewhat murky with sediment, and there is a lot of yeasty gunk in the bottom of the bottle. Smells nicly sour with just the barest hint of sweetness, a bit of briney creaminesss, and some acidic blackberry aromas. No real funk, but clean, tart, and nice. The taste has more blackberry up front and a lingering sourness, and more of that creamy salinity that adds a savor to the whole package, but still no real funk. It drops away a bit after the initial hit of sour and becomes more tart and fizzy than sour. The blacberry is restrained, but more noticeable than in the aroma. Quite fizzy and fairly soft in the mouth but with a nice lingering tartness. I like this quite a bit, but I'd like to see it again in a few years and see what it's done.","Georgiabeer","Nov 17, 2008"
4.25,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D_An interesting take on the style. Fairly well balanced in its sour and sweet tones it also manages to be fairly nuanced as well. It lacks the funk of some of the great Belgian examples though which I would like. The overall prodcut however is quite tasty and is perhaps a different animal all together","sleazo","Nov 15, 2008"

4.2,-1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste is pretty much right on point. Berries come through slightly stronger in flavor, but this is mostly a tart, vinegary, earthy, oaky beer. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Mouthfeel is lively and well carbonated.","Overlord","Nov 04, 2008"

3.87,-9.2,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Not the best appearance on these lambics. Bright orange color and the heads of these lambics never take on any of the color from the fruit. Sour blackberry aromaFlavor has a nice balance of mostly sweet, but also sour elements. Pie-like, with notes of vanilla, cream, as well as some fairly authentic blackberry notes. Really nice ale.","Crosling","Nov 04, 2008"
4.35,2.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Tonight is a special night, so why not try a special beer. Pours a cloudy light pinkish red with a thin off- white head. Aroma of tart blackberries, a touch of wood, and a bit of funk. Begins sweet, finishes tart. Acidic. A very nice example of a fruit lambic. Thanks Josh.","grimreeser","Oct 31, 2008"
4.43,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Paired with a cheese plate of Morbier, Cowgirl Creamery Mt. Tam triple-cream, and Jasper Hill's Constant Bliss. The Lambic went best with the buttery triple cream, and the raw cow's milk Constant Bliss, cutting through the light saltiness and creamy texture.","emerge077","Oct 25, 2008"
3.68,-13.6,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"This was the first of the Upland lambics I have tried, it was pretty darn good and quite tart already for being so young, I originally expected a much sweeter and fruitier beer but was pleasantly surprised, first blackberry lambic I can remember having too, hope to drink again in upcoming years, recommended","Floydster","Oct 09, 2008"
3.88,-8.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This is much better than I anticipated, though it is not really a Lambic in character; it has a much softer sourness and does not have the complexity & funkiness of a well made Lambic (in fact that is the glaring flaw here, it really needs some Brett character to be a great example of a Lambic). This is definitely quite tasty and drinkable and the fruit expression is almost perfect right now; any more and it could get cloying, les and it wouldn't have the requisite fruit levels.","Gueuzedude","Oct 02, 2008"
4.41,3.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- I've been super excited to try these for about the last couple months and I wasn't let down in the least! The first couple drinks are pretty intense but as you acclimate yourself it's terribly drinkable. Cool to know that such great Belgian Style sours are being created right here in the heart of America (take that Cali!). Big thanks again to Matt for his generosity!","younger35","Oct 13, 2007"
4.77,12,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Had this one with all the others last night and this was one of the better ones. Lots of flavor and a very nice pleasant oak presence. The after taste was a treat leaving a very pleasant almost barn yard effect on the palette. Blueberry flavor and the oak barrel blended nicely to give this beer great flavor and exceptionally pleasant treat ..If you're after the Upland Lambic this one is one worth seeking out. I'm going to age one of these in the celler and try it again in a year or 2..MMMHHH I guraentee ya it's going to only get better as the Brett does it's thing!","hrking","Beers"
3.8,-10.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Not as colorful as most lambics I've tried, this still has a nice copper belgian ale appearance, with a nice hit of carbonation. Smells good, like a nice belgian ale, but again, not as fruity as I expected. Nice taste, a great mix of ale with a nice hit of blackberry, with a bit of cask aging. Goes down nice and smooth, with a bit of pop from the carbonation. This seems more like a blackberry wine in a lot of aspects, such as taste and smell, but is worth it if you can find it. An excellent lambic that felt like a cross between a fruit champagne and ale (in a good sense). It's only out for a short time, so get it while you can, but be prepared for the rubbery cork to be a bit of a pain.","JamesS","0"
