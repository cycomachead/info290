4.71,1.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Fou' Foune (2014) - Brasserie Cantillon - Brussels, Belgium - Lambic - 5.00% ABV - This decadent lambic style sour poured a murky, golden-straw color, with a white head that dissipates immediately. The nose featured aromas of puréed apricots, funky Belgian yeast, and tart acidic notes that are quite pleasant to the nostrils. The mouth was outstanding; flavors of ripe apricots are prevalent up front, followed by hints of lemon peel, musty earth, white wine, and funky yeast that create a memorable taste. The mouthfeel was light bodied, with enamel eroding acidity and a bright, apricot finish. This was my first time having Fou', and wow, it was quite delightful. Thanks again for the bottle, @ehrenblanche! 98/100","thebeerfrontier","Jan 24, 2015"

4.65,0.2,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy golden amber with a ton of head that dissipates quickly into an outer lace. The smell is full of apricots, perfectly identifiable, and sweet. There is also a faint musky funk that compliments the apricots. The taste is very similar to the nose. A ton of sweet apricots followed by a nice funk. The feel is light but full bodied. Heavy carbonated but sweet and juicy. I feel like i am taking a big bite of an apricot when i drink this beer. Very solid.","mlhyatt","Oct 25, 2014"

The aroma and taste have all the Cantillon goodness, though as usual this holds not true for every palate. The aroma is sublime like smelling a crate of ripe apricots. Later also the typical Cantillon lambic aromas kick in. Taste is a little more tart and less fruity than the aroma but still very much apricot. This is a great Cantillon with sublime fruitiness, if you can get this fresh.","safaricook","Oct 06, 2014"

I can't remember the last time I had a beer this sour that I enjoyed so much. I can see why BAs seek it out, but at this price I probably won't ever buy it again (or if I do, I'll trade it to someone who's never been able to find it). Not recommended for those new to sours. If you're new to sours and you happen to stumble upon a bottle of this, do yourself a favor. Stash it somewhere and explore several other sours before drinking it, otherwise you may not enjoy it and could possibly waste your money (and the beer).","deadonhisfeet","Jul 25, 2014"

This is a world class beer, but I am surprised at how closely this compares to other American sours I have had. I do think this beer is slightly over-hyped after trying it, there are many American Wilds that rival this that aren't in the top 50 IMHO.","Chibeerguy1","Jun 28, 2014"

You get caught up with the American sour beer scene that you almost forget the superiority of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen when it comes to "sours", "wilds", or whatever you want to call it. On top of those two you also have Rodenbach, De Cam, and Boon also putting out some top notch stuff. Give me an Apricot Mariage Parfait and I just may come in my pants. But babble aside, Fou Foune continues to be that gracious creation it's always been, and a beer by which all other sours should be measured against.","MarcWP","May 25, 2014"

Tart, acidic, funky, unripe fruits on the nose. You can tell it's going to be delicious. It tastes similar to the nose with a slightly sharper carbonation than I'm used to with other Cantillon beers. You could close your eyes and take a sip and feel like someone liquified the skin of a peach. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. I would like it just a tad more creamy, and a tad less sharp.

Essentially, I just want to re-reconfirm that fresh Fou' Foune is delicious, and this year's Fou' Foune is not lacking in apricots. The best advice I have to anyone who's opening up a bottle soon is to serve it at cellar temperature, aerate it and let it warm up a bit- the apricots truly come out as clean, crisp stone fruits in the nose that dance along your palate as you sip it. Great mouthfeel, soft, velvety but with a nice crisp, dry and thirst-quenching finish. There is no defect to be found in this beer- it is still my favorite beer after all this time, and worthy of its status.","Stevedore","Mar 22, 2014"

Pours into my tulip hazy apricot yellow with a very large fluffy and fizzy white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma of apricots, lacto, yeast funk, dusty dryness. This smells both mouthpuckeringly dry and sour. Flavor is apricots up front and tart lemons, with another punch of sour in the middle. Finishes dry but soft with oak and apricots lingering with an extra lacto sour punch. Light bodied with medium to high carbonation. A yummy sour beer with lots to like. The fruit really comes out as this warms a bit so make sure not to drink it too cold. Keeps improving as I go here. very nice. Looking forward to trying my Kriek now.","BMMillsy","Feb 09, 2014"

Smells so fresh and vibrant. The taste its very apricot forward, with some funk on the backend. There's a decent amount of sourness here, but it doesnt take away from the fruit too much. Delicious. The mouthfeel is so creamy, coats the whole mouth with a fair amount of carbonation. The apricot and funk lingers for days. As it warms you get a few more flavors. Some green apple in there. Really glad I got to try this.","Mikeypnh","Jan 29, 2014"

The nose here is just insane, juicy apricots, fruity, funky and acidic, musty barnyard notes, fruity-lemon as well, but the apricot on this is just out of this world, top 3 if not the best smelling beers of all time for me. Taste is good but a step down from the nose, that being said it still is fantastic, big puckering sour upfront, apricot and fruit, lemony, tart all the way through, acidity is fairly restrained, but the fruity funk here is just crazy, apricot aftertaste. Dry puckering mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body. This blew me away, I thought it would be good but this was near perfect, drinking the whole bottle alone was a pleasure and would love to do it again sometime.","peensteen","Jan 02, 2014"

I'm betting the fruit character is much more intense and vibrant, and I look forward to this beer being released next month. Hopefully I get another bottle, after which I will update or add on this review to reflect that.","Clonies720","Sep 13, 2013"

4.81,3.7,4.25,4.5,5,4.75,5,"the great and mighty fou foune, I finally found one. at a hole in the wall called novare res in downtown Portland, maine. this was on the last page of an incredible beer list. I ordered one and was told they were out. I threw a fit like a baby, said id driven 600 hundred miles to get one, and she said she would be right back. she offered me a 2005 lou pepe instead, but I just couldn't switch gears that quick. after sitting there debating what to do for a few minutes, the manager or owner emerged with a bottle of fou foune for me, all dusty and looking very much like something special. they chilled it for a few minutes, before serving it up in a very cool old mail bin with two cantillon wine glass type containers. the beer pours faded orange in color, rustic looking, cloudy, with a white head like fine champagne, rising and receding to about an inch. the smell is just mental, lots and lots of acid here, a fine lambic is the base. lacto and lemon, tart and funky. the apricots seem to add a floral element, a fruity sweetness to balance the sour, but I don't distinctly get apricots just by smelling it. it has the interesting effect of making my mouth water for every tasty treat ive ever had all at once. im watering like blue razz blowpops, sour nerds rope, lemon shaved ice, and porterhouse steak all at once. this sensation alone makes this beer a 5 out of 5 overall. nothing in the beer or culinary world has ever had this effect on my palate, and ive been around both a few times. the taste is very impressive, again, a mellow but distinct lambic as its base, I start to taste the apricots. they have a gentle fuzzy feel and flavor, like licking the outside of one. there is a sweetness there, but the juicy character of the fruit and pulpy morning time flavor profile are not dominant. what is dominant is the yeast. the best of lambic, tart and dry as any beer ive consumed. its acidic, and the lower the bottle gets and the warmer it gets, the more this is pronounced. my last yeasty sip is impossibly sour, putting hair on my chest to say the least. its dry on the palate after an insanely effervescent carbonation experience, but I taste the beer for miles and miles after the swallow. not sure ill have another beer again for awhile (yeah right). this is a one of a kind brew, an art form really, and worth all of the accolades its received and then some. nothing like it on the planet, and easily the best 50 bucks I have spent in awhile. not sure lambic will ever be the same...","StonedTrippin","Aug 22, 2013"

The fruit is there, but it's not as intense as I would have imagined. Still... I'm grasping at straws to find a flaw with this beer. Wonderful. I can't wait to try this beer with a few years in it to really make the sourness intensify.","trxxpaxxs","Apr 29, 2013"

Juicy apricots are contrasted with a touch of leather, barnyard and funk on top of a nice integrated and gradual sourness. The fruit is what shines here though and it makes for an incredible lambic.","TallSaint","Apr 21, 2013"

The beer is definitely typical of Cantillon and carries the Cantillon musty funkiness that is so unique from they're brewery. The funkiness balances terrifically with a nice peach presence and is highly drinkable for a sour.

Definitely had the signature cantillon bretty barnyard funk upfront on the nose with fresh peach apricot fruit notes, good citrusy notes with oak wood and nice acidcy for sure. The peachy apricot fruits came acroos more on the palate alongside great sour acidic notes with oaky wood accents which brought out more flavors, a touch of vanilla and plenty of brett barnyard horse blanket character to go around. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a fruity, semi sweet, bretty funky, woody, acidic sour and dry finish. I definitely dig this beer all around but I thought the 09 vintage was way better.","Gobzilla","Mar 03, 2013"

The flavor is fruity with apricots with a lemony tartness and hints of sour cherries and plums. A solid hit of horsey funk round out the flavor nicely. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. I think I'm going to go against the grain on this one a little bit here.

Distant, dry aroma, citrus zest, musty, touch of apricot. Tartness hits you up front on the palate, very drying, more citrus pith than anything, lemon juice, afterthoughts of candied apricot and grassy funk. Don't drink this if you have chapped lips.

Nose is acetic with a typical Cantillon funk, light oak and a generally piercing acidity all around. Apricots are a bit hidden intially, but begin to reveal themselves more as this moves closer to room temp. Taste wasn't as sour as I had anticipated (7-8/10 sourness?), but still quite acidic in its own right. More white balsamic vinegar, Cantillon funk, only a sliver of oak, and similar to the aroma, warmth aids the revealing of the apricots. Some sweetness in there as well. Lighter medium body and sourness carries well into the finish. Fairly exquisite, and had my nose on this one for a better part of the time. Definitely a sipper, took me and the girlfriend over 2 and a half hours to get through this 750ml.

Bottom line, if you have even a remote interest in this style, you owe it to yourself to seek this out. Even if you don't like the style, if you find it, drink it, odds are your mind will be changed. The price tag was hefty but zero regrets. Drinking it at Moeder just added the cherry (or apricot) on top.","Momar42","Apr 25, 2012"

4.52,-2.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Cantillon Fou' Foune pours a hazy tangerine, with about two fingers of white foam. The head retention is surprisingly good for a lambic, but there's not a speck of lacing left behind. The nose is an absolute apricot bomb, loads of fresh fruit jumping out of the glass. Lurking behind it is some wet hay brett funk and a light lactic sourness. It's a beautiful aroma, but a little bit more balance in terms of more funk and sour to compete with the fruit would really make this perfect. My thoughts on the flavor profile are fairly similar. The big blast of apricot up front is great, but the wild aspects of the beer almost seem like they're just sneaking into the picture on the back end. I really like this beer now, but I think with another 6 months on it, it would be absolutely sublime. One thing that doesn't need time to improve though is the mouthfeel. THe body i crisp and light and paired with a wonderfully bubbly, almost champagne-like carbonation. Fou' Foune is another absolutely killer beer from Cantillon, quite possibly my favorite that I've had from them. It's a shame it's relatively hard to get your hands on, because I'd love to see what a little age does to this beer.","axeman9182","Mar 21, 2012"

I heard fresh is the best way to go with this beer. Pours a very hazy, straw yellow-orange color with a large white head. Very fizzy. Scent is just as funky as I was hoping it would be...quite funky. Sweet apricots in the aroma with some grass and funky cheese. Definitely some sharp cheese aromas. Lots of barnyard funk with a bit of stinky gym socks. Considering this is a fresh bottle, the aroma was much more funky than I was expecting...which is great! Taste is tart at first...not sour. Switches to sweet apricots, funky/strong cheese flavors with a ton of barnyard flavor. Then the apricots come back in, but more sour this time. Finishes even more sour than it started. Great finish to this beer...scratch that, THE BEST FINISH. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some puckering notes and very highly carbonated...could use a little less carbonation. Drinkability is high as it could get. Overall, another AMAZING beer from Cantillon. Now that I've tried this gem, I will be seeking out more.","DovaliHops","Mar 10, 2012"

On the tongue it follows suit, sour apricots, dry, yeasty, in the middle thru the end Im reminded of an easy saison. Finishes with a dry champange feel. Although not very heady, lots of carb bubbles come thru in the mouth. No bite. Not overly sour, only slightly puckering. I am very excited to have tried this.

The flavor is spot on apricots. Underneath is lambic funk. Old closets with damp earth. Citrus pith with crab oranges. All wrapped up with fresh apricot. The mouthfeel is spot on.

This beer pours a slightly cloudy dingy tangerine orange in color with a slight white head that turns into a lacing around the edges of the glass. The aromas are of fresh, lightly sweet, and tart, juicy, mouthwatering candied apricots witha slight acidic sour. It has to be one of the most impressive noses of any lambic. The flavor features tart and juicy fresh apricot, plenty of sharp citric acidity, light oaking, must, and light funk. It has great flavor and finishes light and dry, which makes it even more drinkable. Overall this is one of the finest lambics I've had to date.

4.97,7.1,4.5,5,5,5,5," Fou'Foune has a totally complex amount of flavor with the apricot taste mixing sweet fruit with a tart and mild floral quality while at the same time mild spice and a woody tinge is blended in with slight lactic acidity which never seems to outdo the fruit, just augments it with a seriously intense amount of tropical notes. The apricot skin sour flavor comes out with slight lemony lactic tinges and hints of bitter tannin at times. The woody toastiness works very well alongside the floral and mild sweet flavors from the fruit. with a jammy apricot flavor the sour and complex amount of sweet tangy fruit notes linger until the last sip. The yeast at the end seems to give a more oaky quality that wasn't as evident in the first pour but even that is seriously tasty in its own way. The expectations for this beer were met and completely exceeded. A less aggressive sour than some cantillon beers but it impressed me even more with its balance. I am totally won over by this beer and the drinkability is ultra high to me.","Slatetank","Nov 13, 2011"

4.57,-1.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"2010 bottle, shared with my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend. I have had older bottles of this, but never one nearly so fresh as this. The brew pours a turbid orange hue and is capped with a nice, albeit short-lived, white cap of froth. Wow. It smells so strongly tart, fruity and funky. It tastes like a tart Gueuze macerated in copious amounts of the juicy and tart flesh of apricot and peach - first and foremost - but it also suggests hefty doses of nectarine, Alphonso mango, Mandarin orange supremes, papaya, and loquat. Very very tart. One of the most puckering beers I've had, sip after sip. Many standard nuances of a Cantillon brew (ex.: grassy, woody-tannic and/or bright lemon-y) are obfuscated by the brutal funkiness of this heavily fruit-laden Lambic. Strong acidity here, from the sharply tart malic-tartaric-citric acid notes (akin to sour candy), to the heavy malt vinegar nuance, and finally rounded out by the pungent overipe-rotten orchard fruit notes and a musky hay-straw-barn funk. Overall, this beer is a stunner. Relatively fresh, like this bottle is, the brew is as intensely fruity as any you're likely to encounter. Give it 5 years or so, such as the bottle urwithdave shared with me recently, and the brew is equally stunning, but radically different. The fruit is a ghostly nuance after 5 years, and all of the elements are expressed in a divinely sublime manner, as opposed to the shocking intensity of the fresh brew.","ktrillionaire","Aug 09, 2011"

I realized later that beers should pull their greatness from natural ingredients and not added sugar. Cantillon really shows that natural ingredients can come together to make a beer that really puts the fruit it was aged with in the forefront.","ajcobb24","Jun 21, 2011"

Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, peaches, apricot, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, peaches, apricot, and a slight tart note. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is nothing short of excellent. Everyone at the tasting (including myself) agreed that this was one of the Top 5 beers (out of 45) that we tasted during the night. The aroma was quite inviting and pleasant on the nose. The flavor was very complex and smooth at the same time making this one really easy to drink. This one even looked quite nice as well for a lambic. Really glad I have a bottle of this sitting in my cellar to see how it develops over time. Definitely get this on your palate if you have not before. It is definitely worth trading for without a doubt.","thagr81us","Jun 16, 2011"

First scent brings a definite tart and sour profile, fruit punches through quite aggressively with appricot being backed by peach, a fresh malted grain profile peeks through along with some musty earthyness. Taste is quite impressive - sour and tart without becoming overly puckering, strong fruit notes without being too sweet. Apricot supported by notes of peach and even a touch of berry. grains are musty and lightly damp but freshly dried. Medium bodied, great carbonation level. Great great beer from Cantillon.

The sour and funk are so complimentary to the fruit that it's hard to discern the flavors from one another. It marries so well as to make them indistinguishable nearly as separate flavors. Damn!

4.62,-0.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served slightly chilled, a huge head appeared on a fast pour decanted into one glass to share between the three of us. Hard to tell how much sediment was left, but I would guess 1-2 ounces. Color was a light yellow with a gold hue up to the light with a couple tiny bits of sediment swimming around. Smell was sharp fruit and some vinegar. Described by Ari as "smelling a peach pit." Notes of peach and apricot skin were very evident. The taste was an intense combination of resiny sour apricot and fruity acidity, while much funk was almost nowhere to be found. Unnoticeable alcohol on the palate and finish, but a slight burn from the acidity was present. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and I'm sure it would have been a cinch for any of us to drink over a liter of this. I've had Fou'foune a few times (many courtesy of Weisguy), including a fresh 750 of the 2010 bottling, but this bottle stood out as nearly a whole nother beer than what I tasted before. Much more fruit on the nose and tongue, while the balanced acidity made for a very enjoyable lambic.","sarro","May 11, 2011"

I waited until I had a better trained pallet and understanding of beer, so enough about me lets talk about this wonderful delight known as Fou Foune. I shared a 2010 with Shades Of Gray who so graciously opened my eyes to many Cantillons. First the look of this beer was very appetizing. Its an burnt orange-ish color and leaves a very nice head, full of lacing. Smell is very fruity, definitely strong apricot notes and some funk. Taste, WOW, I'm blown away. Very tart (as to be expected). Just a perfect mesh of carbonation, tart, apricot, and some what earthy in a very good way. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is it left me wanting more.

The aroma is lots of barn-yardiness, but with a lot of apricot fruitiness in there as well with some both clean and dirty laundry. The flavor smacks you in the face right away with apricot, fresh, delicious apricots. The beer is very very sour. It's also really dry with a dryness akin to say a brut. The fruitiness continues with some lemon rind earthy on sour notes. Dominantly this beer is packed with sourness and apricot flavor. The palate is fizzy but remarkably full and easy to drink.

Tons of complexity here with new flavors being discovered throughout the bottle. Matches my experience with other Cantillons I've had. Very good cold/cool, but they turn into simply amazing with a little bit of warmth. Too hard to wait for them to warm up from the start for me (can't wait to dig in), but definitely worth it...although discovering new aspects as the temperature changes has something to say for it too.","portia99","Jul 24, 2010"

Even though the sour is so mouth puckering its really tasty and quite drinkable, each sip just makes you want more and more of it. Super dry finish. The '09 had the most fruit flavor as you'd expect, and the '01 was the most sour beer I've ever had, it was crazy. No way you could drink a whole bottle yourself but amazing for a tasting.","kingcrowing","Jun 26, 2010"
4.32,-6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"As I admitted to my bartender when I ordered it, I have no idea how to truly properly pronounce this beer's name, let alone attempt to define it. I was just excited to see such a touted lambic on draught in my neck o' the woods. It pours a hazy orange straw with a tall head of deeply longevitous (yeah, I said it...now, if only more people would use it...) white froth. As it died away, lingering on as the worst people tend to, it left some nebulous lacing behind. The smell wafting to me is of banana, peach, funk, flowers (pretty ones, I do believe), and a surprisingly healthy amount of vanilla. It's like brewer's potpourri. The taste doesn't bring this high esteem down any, either. Tart berries; sour peach, apple, and grape; a tiny bit of bitterness; and a slight hint of oak (or some kind o' wood, anyway) round out the puckering flavor profile. So this is a true Belgian lambic, eh? I'm impressed. The body is on the lightest end of the medium sub-spectrum, with a sharp, moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. I may not be able to guzzle this tart monster, but I sure as hell want to. Get some!","TMoney2591","Jun 12, 2010"
4.8,3.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"750ml bottle, 2008 version...The beer pours dark peacy with a much darker center. The head is white, rises about a finger and is gone pretty quickly...The aroma is on the lighter side, light tart fruits, mixed with sourness. Not overpowering in either regard so its balanced giving some of what you look for in a fruit lambic...Holy moses, that's one sour beer. Didn't think it would be that tart from the aroma. Its got a huge tart bite sour, not a mucky horse blanker leather like a lot of Cantillon's. Here you get a lot more of the fruit not sweetness but the actual taste of apricots on the finish. Super balanced and flavorful...The feel is great, sticks to the mouth, very tannic...Drinkability is off the charts. It gives me everything I love about a lambic, sourness funk, but balanced enough that you can drink this all day, while at the same time not being such a fruit beer that's its super sweet or dominated by the apricot...Overall one of my favorite lambics, right up there with Blabear.","jrallen34","Jun 11, 2010"

Extremely sharp, acidic and funky with mild apricot fruit sweetness and cheesy funk. It's hard to stop smelling this and actually taste it. Flavor starts initially apricot and oak sweet before becoming overwhelmed by acidic and vinegary sweetness which actually finds a way to become even sharper and more nasty funky in the finish. Not for the faint of heart or novice to the style, and maybe not the best bottle to represent this particular beer, but for a complex fruity and sour lambic this is near impeccable.","yourefragile","May 22, 2010"

The HUGE funkiness comes in after a couple seconds and has a long lasting aftertaste. Leaves a sweet and enjoyable flavor on the lips for a few minutes as well.

Aroma is an immediate signature Cantillon sour yeast element, but ripe fresh apricots are blended beautifully into this one. The sour lemony acetic quality of the lambic is divine paired with the apricots in this. A joy to inahale. The taste is a blast of the sourness I adore from Cantillon paired with a complex fruitiness. What is biting into a fresh lemon at one moment tastes like sour apricots the next moment, or orange zest. If I dare sayso, this is one of the best authentic authentic fruit lambics I have tasted. Body is light, with tight medium carbonatioon that leaves me puckered. As sour as this is, the fruit really enhances everything from aroma to drinkability.

Why again am I trading rare beers for sours produced here when this stuff is readily available? A treasure. Pours a slightly hazy golden with the barest head. Glows in the glass. Smells very sour and acetic with some savory/salty notes, and pure, zingy apricot on the finish. The taste is awesome. Sour, salty, and with absolutely vibrant apricot flavors. Tangy and sweet notes with some light funk/barnyard right at the end. Wonderfully blanced and laser like in flavor.

4.67,0.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Popped the cork on this bottle to find out that it was from early 2006. Poured this one into a Cantillon glass to a bright golden color similar to what you would get in a pilsner with a small white head that dissipates after about a minute to just cover the top of the beer. The smell is quite exceptional with a slight funk fading into a great apricot sweetness, almost exactly what I expected it to be. The flavor of this beer was even better than the aroma. Right up front you get a great dryness that quickly fades into a mouth puckering sourness. This eventually turns tart and the after taste gives you the apricot sweetness. The mouthfeel is quite full considering the beers color with lively carbonation. This beer is a pleasure to drink and a geueze/lambic that would please connoisseurs and novices alike. Although the price was a bit high, this was well worth it.","jastack","Mar 16, 2008"

Bone-dry as we expect from the real lambic makers; very refreshing and drinkable, complements food wonderfully...some of the best brewing art on the planet. Lowish lambic ABVs are a plus for drinakbility in my book. Stirring some yeast into the final pours intensified and added more yeasty notes...I recommend trying it.

Other aromatic Cantillon lambic qualities are also present, but in a subtle way. Unbelievably harsh citric acid flavor, with very little character besides an extreme amount of sourness. This is an unbelievably intense lambic, probably the most sour lambic ever. Its so strange, because I adore the three year old Grand Cru, but that beer has so much more depth and character, besides the sourness. This is just cutting, with very little fruit character.","Crosling","Mar 15, 2006"

The drinkability of this elixir was strongly debated amongst those who were kind enough to share it with me, and as usual concensus was not achieved. I was on the "yes" side, because I already dusted off a 750 by myself in Brussels, however I didn't enjoy the bottle I had at Delirium Café as much as this one.

The aroma is pretty funky: apricot is notable right off the bat, followed by a grassiness, horseblanket, musty earth, wood, and a serious vinousness. The first taste is a powerful, mouth-pckering, roll-up-your tongue, wrinkle-your-face sourness. Lots of acid. This lambic sure isnt sweetened. After the first few sips, and your mouth is prepared, a lot of funkly, fruity flavors come out. The apricot hides, and I could only pick it out as a faint effect of the finish. The musty, horse flavor is present through the taste. This is an extremely dry, extremely astringent brew. Theres a high level of carbonation. Pretty much no hop flavors at all. This is one sour, but subtle beer. The more I drank, the more it grew on me. I wouldnt drink it on its own againbut I think it would be fantastic with food.

The pungent smell reminded me of black earth and turned milk in the Russian River Supplication sort of sense. Im guessing there are a lot of strange bacteria at work here forming this beer into something very unique. Tastes of powerfully sour nectarines, oranges and raspberries. The flavor is so intense, its hard to identify just what fruits were used here. It nearly tastes like vinegar its so tough. Theres also a sour milk flavor here as well. Fortunately, theres a creamy apricot in the finish. Wow. When the waitress said its very sour she wasnt kidding. The mouth feel is thick and the sourness really puckers the mouth quite a bit.

Some oaknotes in the back and dry but this sourness is just too much and think this one needs many years to get for me to an acceptable and balanced taste.

This certainly is not for everyone in any way shape or form but damn I gotta give props to Cantillon for producing something so amazingly original and hard to really describe till you experience this beer. I guess that is the point after all, you need to "experience" this beer if you like non fruity lambics.

Although the kreik is more robust, and stands to lend more flavor, this is still a real treat. The beer is a murky yellow tan color with high carbonation and no head. The smell is unmistakeably Cantillon; as the lambic base and its sharp acidity sting the nostrils. Once sipped, the fresh apricot flavor comes through, but when paired with the lambic it falls a bit flat, and really can't hold its own. I like the weeds, the musty flavor imparted by the Brett, even the way in which the fruit lends a slight sweetness and a bit of a foil to the uncompromising sourness. Make no mistake, this aint some US fruit beer. This is unabashedly raw and I love it. A great one to try.","99bottles","Jun 12, 2005"

It definitely has a sweet connotation, honey-like blended with the horsey fruits (apricot, orange, pink grapefruit). Yep, this is a lambic, very fruity, limey, citric, lactic and funky. Yet, its aggressiveness is rather limited in mouth. Its tart of course, but pretty mellowed out. I assume the bottles are far more authentic in that regard, here, the mouthfeel is so lightly carbonated that it feels a bit lifeless. I wish I had an explanation for the name though!

It was a very mouth-puckering mouthfeel that dries out the mouth.

Yeasty barnyard funk aromas as well as some fuzzy subdued apricot/peach aromas. It is really a culmination of those fruits that have fuzzy skin, like peaches, apricots and kumquats. Some would debate, but only domestic, Belgian apricots are only used in this brew, and it takes on aspects of all fuzzy-skinned fruits. It has a barnyard, wet-dog funk to it not unlike other quality lambics. Quite leathery and earthy. Really hits the sour portions of the tastebuds. Once again Cantillon delivers. Predominant taste is of tannins of unripened apricot skins. Rather acrid, yet wholly enjoyable for lambic lovers everywhere. Just make sure you drink within it's window of oppurtunity when fresh fruit is in it's character. Other unfruited lambics stay longer and are better aged.","crookedhalo","Jul 31, 2004"

The mouthfeel is slightly prickly and more than slightly puckering. Not quite as mouth puckering as some of the other Cantillon selections I've had though. This one is held in check somewhat. It's pretty refreshing. The horse blanket is there. And the acidity is definitely there. Very slight apricot. Grape skin and unripe green apple. Nicely put together.

The fruitiness is very toned down. A pinch of apricot but burried beneath all of the acidity and tartness. Some light earthy notes and fresh grassy layers. Nice acidity although not to the degree of the gueze for example. For me this is a great beer for a starter or even a night cap. The perfect summer beer.

The aroma gives the impression that this beer is going to be sour, which is the case for lambics especially from this brewer. At first, the beer almost puckers the mouth, but you are rewarded for continuing. The apricot flavor is soft and subtle amid the complexity of a wood aged lambic.

The beer is a cloudy orange copper and looks amazing in my flute. A thin layer of foam formed across the top. It smells like most lambics. The first sip begins mellow and then its tartness expands to its full potential. My cheeks puckered a little before the fruity apricot aftertaste filled my throat. Man the aftertaste is refreshing. The funk is sour, yet not overbearing, and adds some zest and zing every step of the way (hints of lemon, apricots, and of course yeast).

If I did not know this beer I would have no idea that it was made with apricots. The lambic beasties have completely obliterated all signs of the apricots. As a lambic type beer this is quite good, though seems a bit simplistic compared to some of the other offerings. Tastes more of a citrus type fruit, which comes from the acidity.

The sweetness of the fruit is squelched in the flavor, although there is definite apricot character.
