Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, berry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour berry and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a fairly one dimensional aspect with the sourness.","UCLABrewN84","May 23, 2014"

4.12,5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This one was shared during the big Upland sour tasting amongst a large group of BAs! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a purplish red with a half finger pink head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, blueberries, funk, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, blueberries, funk, tart, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This was my second favorite from this tasting which included all of the Upland fruit lambics and Sour Reserve Batch 1 (which took #1). We figured no one had brought Blåbær so this would make a decent substitute. We were right on that aspect. While not as funky like most Cantillons, this one definitely carried a similar flavor profile. With this one being MUCH easier to obtain I would not think twice about pick as many of these up as possible based on my two experiences with this brew. A definite must try for anyone who calls themselves a sour fan. If you haven’t tried it before, you need to do so…","thagr81us","May 30, 2012"

Beer looks flat. Smell is of fresh blueberries and a earthy funk. You can smell a good mixture of tartness from the blueberries. Taste is semi fresh blueberries with a decent tartness. A small hint of funk is present, but this isn't as sour as I would like for a Lambic. Carbonation is very low and this beer is almost flat. Overall a disappointing Lambic offering.

CO2 also makes the beer seem brighter and more lively. Overall this was a delicious beer, but I think more lambic aroma and taste would really take this over the top. Perhaps what this beer is more time in barrels to give the critters a chance to break down even more of the sugars, as I tasted a tiny bit of residual sweetness. I think that more time before fruit addition would help get more wildness and sourness in the beer.","Soonami","0"

Kind of a sweet batter aroma to this. Andy said it kind of reminds him of blueberry pancake batter and I think that is spot on. It's slightly tart in the aroma with a decent balance of sweetness. The taste is a bit on the subtle side. Barely tart and barely sweet. It's kind of the Switzerland of beers. I really like the nice light body but I think the carbonation is a bit much.

Smell is full of blueberries with a slight lactic sourness. As other reviews state, it does remind me of blueberry cobbler. Taste is actually a good balance of sweet and sour. I would prefer it to be more sour, but the taste of tart blueberries is excellent. This is definitely not in the same league as most belgian lambics... but if you take it for what it is, it's damn tasty. Mouthfeel is a little lacking, pretty thin. Drinkability is high, I had no trouble finishing the whole 750 myself over the course of an hour or two. Not sure how long I'll hold onto my other bottle, I enjoyed this one a lot.","khumbard","Jan 27, 2011"

This was brought in by my buddy, 'Lil Bear who was given this beer by my brother & myself as a "Thank You" for driving down to Bloomington with us to pick up our reserved lambics last December. We all agreed it was a little premature to open this bottle so early in the aging process, but it was a grand symbolic gesture we all enjoyed. Poured a fizzy pink/purple. There was a very surface souring that just kinda teased my taste buds. Like I mentioned this may have been too fresh, but that worked well with the fresh Michigan blueberries used in making this drink. My overall impression was of Greek yogurt with unripened blueberries on top. I can't wait to open my second bottle of this in a few more years.","burnheartsMKE","Jan 09, 2011"
4.21,7.4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall - I was a little bit let down with the Strawberry lambic last night, but the Blueberry got me back on track.

Recommended, and I may be trying to obtain more bottles.","mrandypandy","Jan 08, 2011"

While this was quite nice, I was immediately distractive by the overpoweringly-assertive nature of the blueberries in the nose. It was a symphony of blueberry breakfast items with loads of blueberry syrup and pancakes plus a slight amount of tartness. Really well done. The taste nails the fresh blueberry as well and adds in a touch of sourness. The mouthfeel is a bit tart and a bit sweet. Drinks incredibly well. I think the blueberries are the highlight of this one and I won't be waiting long to drink my other bottle. I think the fruit character that really makes this beer will be gone well before this really sours up, if that happens.","Thorpe429","Jan 01, 2011"

Aroma is reminiscent of blueberry maple syrup but with more sharpness to it. Tastes like overripe blueberries, the kind that if you eat they're a little too soft and mushy and don't taste as bright and sharp as ripe ones. Pretty tart but the acidity/sourness is toned down here compared to any expectations one might have for a 'lambic.'","illidurit","Aug 10, 2009"

Relatively low acidity- especially compared to a lot of the other beers we sampled.

It smells tart, like oak, blueberries, and some funk and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, I can taste vinegar, blueberries, oak, and some vanilla. However, the taste is subtle, and I wish it had a little more kick to it. Mouthfeel is thin, seems a bit watery to me. Not much carbonation either, however there is some slickness which is nice. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. I think it's an OK enough beer, but there's definitely some room for improvement with this.

Stemmy blueberries on the nose with quite an impact. The aroma fades on the finish. Not quite as lush as I'd like. A little thin and sour to start as far as the taste goes, but the blueberries make an appearance toward the finish as nice, clean fruit. The mouthfeel is thin and a little sour. A little perfumy overall, and a bit stemmy. Could be lush, or could be bracingly sour, but it straddles those lines without really deciding which direction it would like to go and without making a statement. Somewhat pleasant, but could be so much more.","Georgiabeer","Mar 19, 2009"
2.3,-41.3,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,3,"750 ml bottle acquired in a trade a few months back, opened last night with my girlfriend, poured into my Belle Vue flute glass, pretty much flat with a miniscule head that disappers immediately, no lacing or anything, just a still body that looks like the cranberry juice I had with breakfast, would have thought it would have been darker with it being a blueberry lambic, smell consists of mild tartiness, soft berries, vanilla, light oak, and funk, taste is quite weak and I kept thinking over and over to myself, where is the fruit, very light tart at the beginning, then it turned into pretty much juice without a sweet or sour fruit flavor, just bland and starightforward, did not change once it warmed, too mild for a lambic, just dry in the finish with no taste to go along with it, it is like barely flavored juice with a tonic water finish, not much of a mouthfeel, dry and once in a while mildy tarty, low level of carbonation was one of its main problems, for something that was both corked and capped, you would expect the contrary, taste did not linger at all, taste more like it was aged in a ziploc bag than a wooden barrel, could drink more of this stuff because of how light it is but would not want to, no complexity and is not anything close to other interpretations of this style, this was the worst of the Upland lambics I have had so far, almost half the bottle ended up being poured down the drain, very limited fruit flavor and the lack of carbonation pretty much ruined it, would not drink again, this was the second time I had it and it was the same each time, so can eliminate the idea of it being a bad bottle, certainly not worth what I traded for it, not recommended","Floydster","Mar 18, 2009"

A small amount of slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma consisted of oak, sugary blueberries, and a hint of funkiness. The flavor was made up of muted blueberry notes, wet wood, and a very light brettiness. Finished mostly dry, but was not very acidic or puckering. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and minimally carbonated. Almost still. Goes down like uncarbonated fruit juice.
