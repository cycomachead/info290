4,1.3,4.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Very aggressively sour like most/all Upland lambic-style beers. The color is distinctly cherry, which is quite impressive. Looks like well carbed cherry juice. The smell is mostly tart but not overtly yogurty or too strong. I do get the cherry flavor despite the aggressive tartness from this beer. The flavor is actually quite good for how overtly tart this beer is. Unfortunately, 2 ounces was enough to give me that stomach burn feeling. I just don't understand why these Uplands have to be so aggressive in the sour/tartness. This is the second best I've had after Strawberry.","PHBoiler","Jul 07, 2014"

Heavy cherry aroma, acidic, lots of lacto tartness, vinegar, red wine. There seem to be mixed reports on this beer, especially in the sourness department, but this bottle at least was VERY sour. Intense blast of tartness in the taste, sour cherries, acetic acid, lemon, tannins, notes of leather, red licorice, and I even picked up a subtle touch of cocoa, strange as it seems. Tart up front, tart in the finish. Medium body, crisp, prickly mouthfeel, and if I didn't say it before: very tart. No problems with this bottle, it's a very good sour overall, though I'm on duty to conquer this whole bottle myself tonight, so I'd better break out the Tums.","Rifugium","Feb 23, 2014"

The fruits are not the focus, some berries and cherry in back. The taste follows the nose, more musky mushroom and some earthy cheese. The cherries are in back, very nice sourness, assertive but not puckering. The body is rather full, moderate carb, probably a touch low, and semi dry finish.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, tart, sour, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was pretty good, but not very complex. This was okay as it was still quite nice. The flavor on this one was quite good though.

Served in a flute, the beer pours a pinkish/orange color with about an inch light pink head that stayed around a little while. There's also some sediment floaties that I can see in the glass. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is tart cherries, oak, funk and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some lemon peel noticable. The cherry flavor is weak at first, but it does get somewhat stronger as the beer warms up more. With that being said, the cherry flavor still wasn't strong overall. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with high carbonation. I think it's a decent enough brew, I'd like to try Upland's other fruit lambics to see how they compare with this one.","bluejacket74","Jun 01, 2011"
2.02,-48.9,2,2.5,2,1,2,"(D)- Thus far, easily the most disappointing from the Upland Lambic lineup. The fruit is muted despite how fresh it is yet and there really isnt much else going on aside from some damp oak and very minute tartness. I literally almost had to chew this since there was so much "gunk" in this beer. I am sorry to say that this was a fail in my opinion.","sweemzander","May 29, 2011"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer is a cloudy, hazy pink hue with a small head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma brings some light funk with a healthy dose of tart cherries. The taste follows suit. This isn't among my favorite Upland lambics, but is enjoyable nonetheless. Oak barrel notes emerge more as the beer warms. The finish brings moderate acidity. Overall, a solid fruit lambic, and one I would certainly have again.","Huhzubendah","May 29, 2011"

Still, worth trying once.","Verecund","May 20, 2011"
3.7,-6.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Beer is pretty funky and sour with a mild tartness from the cherries. The beer is less cherry than I expected more acetic and stronger oakiness and Brett character than I expected. I liked it enough but it is not my favorite lambic of theirs.","drabmuh","May 13, 2011"
4.02,1.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: This was a tasty enough cherry sour, but it paled in comparison to both of the other ones I sampled at the same release (Cisco Monomoy Kriek and 3F Oude Kriek '06). Nothing bad about it at all (I was afraid from the aroma that it would be too sweet overall, but the acidity in the flavor was terrific), but nothing really stood out, either. Worth trying if you're even slightly interested, but not something I'd go out of my way to have again.","woosterbill","May 13, 2011"
4.07,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a hearty red color with a light pink head that forms and quickly disapears. Aroma is acidic with funk and a strong presence of cherries. Taste is a bit more acidic then its brother brew the blackberry. The acidic flavor is accompanied by the funk and cherries, which in this case the cherries stand out a bit more. Again with the mouthfeel as in the blackberry this brew felt great! My taste buds were left intack for the rest of the tasting which is greatly appreciated. Really enjoyed this brew and will purchase in the future.","BZero007","May 12, 2011"

I thought the flavor of the cherries really saved this beer.","cpmichael","May 08, 2011"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This lambic poured a light bodied spritzer like, faded rose in color with a one finger white head. The head quickly dissipated to lace the glass. It didn't look like the other lambics that I've had from Upland to date. It was a lot lighter in color and looks to be more carbonated. Also, this bottle didn't gush like some of the others have. The aroma is a nice, tart cherry upfront with little funk. The flavor too is all business. You get tart cherry with just the lightest touch of Upland's house yeast. It also has a nice dry finish. This seems to be one of Upland's more forward lambics, meaning it's closest in flavor to the fruit they are featuring (the Peach is probably the second closest). Like I said, this beer is more carbonated than their others. It's a fine drink and a pretty good sour. Is it great? Probably not, but it's worth trying and they only make between 400 and 450 bottles per batch.","aasher","Beers"
3.46,-12.4,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, a decent effort - nowhere near as good as blackberry or blueberry, in my opinion. Will be interesting to see how this develops at the fruit character dies down a little. Should improve as the brett dries this out.","kundog18","0"
3.48,-11.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I'm a little disappointed by this as cherry is usually my favorite lambic flavor. The "cherry" was a little hard to point out in this beer, however the fruity sweetness was not. These beers are pricey and a pain to obtain which knocks this as well. I've had the blackberry from this same batch and I thought that was MUCH better than this.","cetherid","Mar 05, 2011"

This is just not a good beer, and having two similar bottles takes out the chance of a bad 1st bottle.","weatherdog","Mar 01, 2011"
3.08,-22,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D: Its surprising that the Upland lambics have been so hit-or-miss for me at this point. The strawberry and raspberry were amazing but the blueberry and now cherry have been pedestrian at best.

The nose brings some muted cherry characteristics along with a bit of earth and maybe some light, light oak. The taste is again mild cherries with a bit of sourness and light grain.

Woodiness, and cherries are there all right, and sourness is malted away. A good drinking ale, nice summer drinker but neither outstanding as far as a kriek goes, better than average for a fruit beer. Active carbonation that aids digestion through burping. Sourness builds up, men drink up. Being traditional lambic cherry, it may be that the strawberry was superior and more unique.","Sammy","Jun 09, 2009"

I pick up a light fruitiness on the nose, but can't really describe it. Taste is tart up front with a mild barnyard and a dry oak finish. Theres a lot less funk in the taste than the nose lead me to believe. Mouthfeel is acidic and slightly syrupy, carbonation is medium to high, body is medium. This is a light refreshing fruity funky brew for sure. Very easy to drink, but I would have liked a bit more lactic and definitely a bit more cherries.","johnnnniee","May 25, 2009"

A sour scent of cherries is strong and very dominant, with a slight hint of a malt, with a yeasty funkiness at the end. A very tart and tanginess of cherries, the blending to a mild maltiness, though the cherries stay with you till the end. It finishes with a yeasty souriness. Very evervesant, much like champagne, the carbonation stays with each taste. A thin to medium bodied feel, ending with a mild dryness. It is truly nice to see american brewers venturing into the world of lambics. Kudos to Upland, for making a truly a very good beer.","cameraman","Dec 14, 2008"

Not much lacing. The aroma included sour cherry skins, oak, a hint of wheat, and cobwebs. The flavor consisted of a big burst of dry, sour cherries on top of a delicate wheat base. Mildly funky and tart. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and had crisp, aggressive carbonation. A pretty nice beer, but I would have prefered a little more funkiness.","mdm46410","Dec 13, 2008"

Calms down over time, or perhaps my palate is acclimating. Feel has a typical carbonation; liquid is typical. This is a good lambic. For an American producer to release a lambic that doesn't absolutely suck says something. Now all we have to do is work on the complexities and iron out the wrinkles and we can start getting cocky against Cantillon.","RblWthACoz","Nov 12, 2008"
