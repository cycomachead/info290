4.24,1.7,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Has a lively carbonation, bready soft malts, which interact well with the huge, but gentle cherry fruitiness. At no point does the sourness of this beer roll over the fruity cherry impression, which comes along with red vinous grapes and a subtle oak defined maltiness. Bretts stay in the background of the composition, they only support the cherries with an enjoyable tartness in the end, accompanying the fermented fruits. Oakiness goes incredibly well with the bursting cherries print, exposing their full-bodied, smooth fruitiness. Wine and oak define the body of this beer, leading to a well balanced, superior cherry fruitiness.","aleigator","Mar 14, 2015"

4.41,5.8,4,4.75,4.5,3.75,4.25,"The palate opens quite pronouncedly sour, lactic and lemony with a leathery sour cherry character being most noticeable up front. This then yields to a fruity mid-palate with plenty of cherry flavor ranging from the bright tartness of sour cherries to the floral and fruity complexities of the sweeter varietals. Funk in the form of earth and barnyard are present. Drying, faintly sweet and very tart on the finish, this is very enjoyable. A faint oiliness is present, a heft from the cherries that isn't present in a regular kriek (including the Lou Pepe) adds a unique dimension to this beer. It does, however, get in the way of the lemony base lambic and the tannins from firming up on the finish , leaving it just a little watery instead. All said, though, this is a marvelous beer, though maybe not worth the $24 or so it goes for retail.","DefenCorps","Mar 10, 2015"

3.64,-12.7,3,4,3.5,3,4,"12.7 oz bottle poured into shaker. Clear red to purple with no head or lacing. Aroma is tart cherries, cherry cough syrup, sour cherry, breadcrumb malt, and some oak. Taste is moderately sour with lactic acidity under cherry skin flavors, lightly sweet cherry juice, and if you focus there’s a little wood and leather bitterness; the medicinal flavor is prominent, which I find unfortunate. Light to medium body, sticky texture, low carbonation, and a lip-puckering dry finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 08, 2015"

A ruby red color like a fire truck, true to its name, an intensity and vibrancy not seen since atrial. Not much head on it, but it doesn't need one. Aromas of exploding pie cherries and cherry jam, funky as anything I've had from these guys, and quite heavy in the lacto. It's mature and my mouth is watering hard. The cherry flavor is so robust and sour, like candy almost, brilliantly alluring, sexy, oh man. It's even more cherry forward than their other krieks, although I don't know by how much. Sour too, I thought it might be cloying, but it's just perfect. Oak mellows it's feel a lot, it's really dry too for what it is. I wouldn't change a thing here, but it would be so sick to line all these krieks up for one tasting. You can taste it for miles, more depth with every sip, and a pungency uncommon even in the wild ale world here on the yeast. Up there with any I've ever had, I'm in love!","StonedTrippin","Nov 20, 2014"

Not as dry and effervescent as I expected, with only low to medium carbonation. Lingering cherry malt left on the palate. Very much on the lambic and wheat flavor more so than the cherry overall, which is good and keeps it from being medicinal like I get from some krieks.

Beautiful, bright berry aroma - cherries of course, but so much more - raspberry and even blueberry notes, really fruity, very subdued lambic character. Taste is also very fruity without being overly sweet - low lambic character but mostly because of its young age rather than too much sugar. Palate is smooth and silky, med-dry with medium carbonation. Delicious.","Noyt","Jul 02, 2013"

Only a ring of bubbles lasts more than a minute or two. Smells strongly of cherries. Good acidity. Solid lambic funk. There are some deeper berry and red wine flavors. Taste is actually sweeter than expected. There's a ton of cherry juice in the beer. Some light horse blanket funk. Mild to medium sour pucker in the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty normal. There's some body to the beer. I really enjoyed this one, but it wasn't quite what I expected. Lots more juicy cherry sweetness.","popery","Jun 22, 2013"

More cherry-pie fruit, some apple pie spice, deep sourness, an oak quality, less complex than a traditional kriek. Mildly cloying in the mouth, which works itself out. While it's supposed to be billed as an aperitif, I would suggest only a small serving to let the acidity open up the mouth for other things.","ManforallSaisons","Jun 08, 2013"

The nose is quite potent with booming notes of cherry (not cough-syrupy) and funk. The taste presents even more aspects of the cherry including the leaves, pit, and twig, mixed with some funk...interesting. The mouthfeel isn't nearly as tart as expected with bold cherry sweetness upfront and a semi-dry, lingering tartness. I expected something that was a lot more tart and dry, possibly just a bit underdeveloped. I think this is definitely a potent kriek that highlights the cherry in a unique way. I'd let it hang out in your cellar a bit before opening.","ThePorterSorter","May 26, 2013"

Aroma is pure cherry flesh, slightly tart, light vanilla, graham cracker by cherry pie association; sweet and fruity but not particularly "lambic"-y. Flavor is fairly sweet to start; fresh cherry pulp and skin with a light sour finish. Some acidic and doughy notes linger in finish. Medium thick body with very soft carbonation. From the color and aroma I'd guess this almost has too much fruit? I'd expect trying this again in event just a few months might be a much different/enjoyable experience, but fresh this is disappointment lacking much depth, complexity, acidity or just all around, good ol' lambic ness.","yourefragile","May 11, 2013"
