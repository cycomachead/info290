4.19,0.7,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Tastes of sweet cherries, very intense, goes along with a decent bitterness, which is for a very long time not as present as the cherries themselves. The supporting tartness brings out the cherries realy good. In the end, bitterness gets stronger and takes over. Overall when you drink this beer, you feel like chewing on ripe cherries, which grow younger and more sour the longer they linger on my tongue. Fruits are present nearly to the very end. As the beer warms up, it reminds me of summer, because of its somehow warm smell. Carbonation grows more present in the end, revealing the bitterness of this beer.","aleigator","Mar 16, 2015"

4.1,-1.4,,,,,,"Deep red pour with creamy pink head; smells like sweet cherry pie filling and lemon with a touch of bready malt. The cherry tastes surprisingly dry and intense. It steals the show and overshadows the base lambic. However what is there is really tasty. Moderately sour. There is some lemon and apple on the taste and an oakiness that adds some astringent medicinal quality. There is also an earthiness throughout but not very funky. The mouthfeel is great. Tiny bubbles and creamy head work as a perfect delivery system for this cherry pie in a glass. I really like this beer and glad I finally found it on the shelf at my local shop. It's nicely balanced and a pleasure to drink. Perhaps the base lambic would develop a little bit more with some age - but I'm not sure how the intense cherry flavor would fare. I'll just have to put one away for awhile and find out.","brianmandell","Oct 28, 2014"

Pours the color and clarity of cranberry juice with a rocky, three inch, pink-colored head.  Nose expresses citrus, cork, horse blanket and a hint of cherries.   Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a suggestion of cinnamon and cherry sucrets.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just shy of lively and a mild acidity.

Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky pink head with insane retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Beautiful. Aromas of big sour cherry, cherry skin, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, pepper, musty wet basement funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of funky/earthy yeast, sour cherries, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, cherry skin, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, pepper, musty wet basement funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cherry skin, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, pepper, wet basement funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity and balance of funky/earthy yeast, sour cherries, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an oudstanding kriek lambic style. All around awesome complexity and balance of funky/earthy yeast, sour cherries, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the modest acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 30, 2014"

4.5,8.2,,,,,,"awesome brew here, as good as any of the 3F stuff I think, and one of the funkier more mature krieks I have had, up there with the best of the Belgians. great rose colored liquid, rather clear for the style, with a pink quartz colored head, thick as whipped cream and rising up like this thing has been ready to burst through the cork and cage for an eternity. so happy to be free, it emits aromas of tart cherries, baking pies, and of course funky oaky lactic lambic that's well blended and especially sour. the cherries sweeten it up only slightly in the taste, and the vinegar smelling salt intensity of the nose is better integrated in the flavor. cherries are enormous, not a faint accent but a dominant flavor, I could have predicted that from the jammy red color. head never settles, and the carbonation on it is effervescent and super bright. tart and sour both from the fruit, sour from the lambic and downright woody from its time in oak. mature as they come, dynamic and never getting too sweet. a lightness hangs in this one, making a small bottle not quite enough for me, its interesting enough that I will likely buy another one because I don't feel done with it. top notch stuff, super fairly priced, and as good as any kriek out there. trust me.","StonedTrippin","Aug 14, 2014"

It does have a nice acidity, especially in the finish, pure sour cherry flavors, and a long moderately refreshing finish just touched by some wood notes that help round things out. Very pleasurable in any case, and probably the best that can be found over here on any sort of regular basis these days- though even that's a spotty proposition.","Georgiabeer","Oct 17, 2013"

No it's not hyped like other beers, but it definitely deserves the highest praise. The problems with most other krieks ranges anywhere from a bold bitterness which results from the cherry pits to cloyingly sweet. The aging in the oak really rounded out and mellowed that flavor and this beer is fully attenuated so there is virtually no residual sweetness. The body is almost like velvet but still thin enough to make this beer insanely drinkable. Such a dark rich red color, its almost like a fine rose champagne, with the bubbles to match. The smell of vanilla oak and cherries hit. You drink in and are intoxicated with fresh juicy cherry essence. There is absolutely no trace of hotness in this beverage, you would think its alcohol free! the aftertaste is pleasant and sings of cherries. Perfection! I will be keeping this on stock as often as possible! Such a fine beverage.","devlishdamsel","Jun 10, 2013"

We also note the presence of bitterness due to the nuclei of cherry that gives a taste of almonds, but it really does not persist in the palace. A place we find ourselves with a touch of red fruit jam style and I must say that this is successful, even very well in this beer.","ThaCreep","Aug 26, 2011"

Best before date says 10/03/2030. Wow. Some musty (in a good way) earthy and barnyard aromas along with that ever present cherry. Sharp tartness upfront that hits your tongue in a wave and the acidity moves to the side of your tongue and to the back of your palate. Next comes the cherry flavor to give you a bit of a break from that acidity. A little maltiness to remind you that you are in fact drinking a beer. Followed by a long dry finish that leaves the palate cleansed and ready for another sip. This is one of my favorite Lambics and a great example of its particular style. I only wish I could afford to drink it more often.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 27, 2011"

Overall a very earthy brew that was a pleasure to drink. This brew finishes quite crisp and dry leaving you wanting more. My only gripe about this brew is how much the oak comes through in the aftertaste, it is a little over the top even for someone who loves oak inclusion in a brew.","stakem","Jul 13, 2011"

It's definitely not as tart as it could be but it's a fine drink. It drinks very well and has good flavor.

The tartness comes first, followed by the sweetness. I also get great wooden flavors and acidic fruit juice. This beer is delicious. All the Cantillon heads must have reviewed this beer, because they made it seem like it wasn't sour at all. Although this lambic finishes with a sweet cherry flavor, it definitely has a sour taste.

The funk doesn't overpower the cherries and the light grains (first time mentioned...I know) really provide that hay-ish bed for nesting of the yeast and ripe cherries. I do like the almost "solera" blending of young and old - having read and thinking of it depth is certainly enhanced.

Looks like a glass of blood with some sediment mixed in. The smell is largely barnyard, must, and tart cherry. Definite lacto character. Sour cherry taste, but the tartness is rather restrained compared to offerings from some other traditional producers. A certain "funk" and woody earthiness to it. Overall quite dry, as it should be. Medium body with heavy carbonation. Nice, traditional kriek that makes for an easy drinker (as far as lambics go).","philipquarles","Jun 06, 2009"

The fine and soft carbonation supports a medium body that in turn shows the moderately tart fruitiness treading light on a mature and rounded lambic platform - maybe the secret lies in the "old" lambic base? As pointed out by many previous reviewers, I also share the opinion that, although this is not the most "distinctive" Kriek beer, it's nonetheless a harmonious and superbly-crafted one.

On the tongue, the fruit flavor is much more pronounced and complex, largely sour but with a very subtle hint of sweetness. Acidity is moderate to high, making for a slow sipper, but a highly enjoyable one. A touch of grain and esters appear in the dry finish, but the cherry flavor dominates here.

Sour funk and assertive brett aromas with a distinctly cherry character throughout. The taste is tart, indeed, but not nearly as mouth-puckering as offerings from Cantillon or De Ranke. Tannic sour cherry skin flavors ride along a dense and driving bretty funk train. Vinous and terribly refreshing, with an appropriate and satisfying dryness to the finish that provokes the next sip.

Excellent carbonation keeps coming for quite a while. Aroma is a bit musty, with sour cherries and lambic yeast battling it out for supremacy, ultimately fiighting to a draw. Palate strikes a balance between the ultra-sour gueuze lambics and the syrup-sweetened fruit lambics. Sour cherries blend with a tarter, more vinegary base from the gueuze. A fairly sharp astringency seizes the tongue at first, but subsides a bit after a few more sips. Body is smooth, lightly creamy, and beautifully sparkling.

Smell is a little oak and vinegar in the back dominated by an overpowering sourness. There is some mustiness that perks up at one point bringing to mind an old cobwebby barn. Very subtle though. Taste is shockingly sour! This is possibly the sourest thing ever. Very acidic. And yet behind it all, there is a little bit of bread, and of course the cherry flavor, though it is purely tart and not sweet at all as others have mentioned. The cherry comes out more as it warms, making this taste juicier, but I prefer it served very cold. The finish is extremely dry and never ending!

The sour and acidic flavor intensifies as I swallow the beer, but fading as quickly as they assaulted my taste buds. It leaves a residual cherry flavor and gives nice sweet cherry burps.

Merely taking the cage off caused the cork to fly out, hit my 9 foot ceiling than land about 6 feet away. That certainly made a nice first impression. Pours a deep ruby red with an immense (obviously) pinkish head that is very soft and cloud like. Aroma is very sour with just a little hint of mustiness, if you strain (or imagine) a faint note of cherry is perceivable. Taste is intense. Very tart. Definetely causes some pucker.

4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Vaguely hazy, amazingly scarlet in hue with a tint of magenta, it has great color depth. A massive amount of bubbles raced towards the largely white but noticeably pink influenced head. I was very impressed with the head retention; it reached a modest half finger in height and held that size for a long time. The subsequent lacing was lacking, as in none. This is a beautiful beer visually. The nose screams real deal lambic! There is a big, all encompassing airiness about the bouquet that somehow captures the essence of Belgium, it seems bigger than the beer itself; it wraps the other aromas in a nice little parcel. This package contains notes of hay, cherries that are largely tart, barnyard funk, a box of nails, wine, stray sourness, lemon, two-week-old wheat bread, wood, and a sack of old barley. The potency is a little shy for me, I worked hard for the subtle aromas, I am glad I found them as this is one inviting beer. The palate is very refined, there is no bullshiting here, it is straightforward, pedal to the metal tart; it is puckering tart. That is damn nice and very refreshing. After a few shocking sips I could notice more cherry flavor, wood too, hay, funk, a bit of white wine, lemon zest, some bready notes, grape skins, and more cherries. Damn this is tart! If you missed the point Ill summarize, this is complex. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant, medium in body with big carbonation, as wanted. I have no complaints about the mouthfeel but Id like a touch more bulk, thats just me. The drinkability is excellent. There is a whole lot of flavor and it jived perfectly with my tastebuds. I found it amazingly refreshing; I know this would be killer on a humid summer day. I hope the next time I visit Johns Grocery in Iowa City they will still have some more to purchase. That is where I bought my 12.7-ounce bottle. Recommend.","bditty187","Apr 28, 2004"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance: Ruby red body pink finely carbonated head leaves behind thick patches of lace nice appearance. Aroma: Black tart cherries very acidic in nature with some cherry sweetness as well, pleasant yeast note as well brings a bready subtle tone to the table. Taste: Extremely tart blend of cherries, touch of cask aged notes excellent traditional lambic, not as lip puckering as a Cantillon but tart nonetheless. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied effervescent bubbly texture. Drinkability: Nice all around traditional fruit lambi, excellent stuff and damn affordable around 4 dollars not bad at all. This is a drinkable lambic I love the complexity of a Cantillon and the candy like sweetness of a Lindemann's but this one has a balance that I just find more palatable and consumeable for session drinking.","WVbeergeek","Mar 21, 2004"

4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a deep red almost maroon color and formed a pink salmon bubbly head that retained itself, only slowly subsiding leaving trace lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of cherries, yeast, plus wine aspects with a hint of wood/pine. A flavor of cherries, with a vinous quality not found in the sweet types. The finish is sour and astrigent in wine style that is not present in Lindemans and others.","Wildman","Mar 06, 2004"
3.86,-7.2,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall Impression: A quite high quality kriek, though a bit too sour without much overt fruitiness to compensate. Beautiful color, foam and clarity. Quite a clean flavor.","GreenCard","Feb 20, 2004"
4.8,15.4,5,5,5,4,4.5,"Served from a corked and caged 375 ml green bottle with a best before date of 2022. The smallish cork popped with little effort. When the geuze-kriek was poured into a glass chalice, an ample fizzy pinkish white head formed and gradually settled into a fine, rich blanket with thicker edges and fantastic lacing. It was quite effervescent...like champagne. This pink-ruby hued beauty was very pleasing to the eye! The complex nose was beaming with fresh cherries, accompanied by sour-tinged oak, earth, and must. The first sip was very puckering, in a lemon juice kind of way. With the second sip, the puckering was gone, and in its place was a fantastically complex array of sour/tart notes that danced on my palate. This delightful celebration of flavor was infused with juicy cherry essence and earthy tones. The kriek finished dry and alive with long-lingering cherry tartness. The flavors were big but masterfully balanced, resulting in an extremely satisfying experience. The carbonation was just right, and the body was appropriate. The Vandervelden family made a fine product here, and it is sad that they are no longer going to produce fine ales such as this again. They don't much better than this!","HiroProtagonist","Jan 31, 2004"

4.73,13.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The taste was of tart cherries, and an excellent tasty yeast 'bite'. The lingering effect of the tart taste was very nice, and it certainly made me want more. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, chock full of the various malts used in this beer. This is one beer that is highly drinkable, but must be done so with considerable respect--there simply aren't many beers in the world like this one. Although I'm not a huge fan of the lambic/gueze/faro family, I know a classic when I taste one, and this is certainly one of them. Happy New Year!","RedBaron","Jan 01, 2004"

4.48,7.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I am not very fond of Lambics-Fruit style beers, but this one I truly enjoyed drinking and rating. It poured an average sized ivory head with fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was clear with very lively carbonation with a red-ruby hue. The nose was that of cherries with a sweet, cherry, sour, tart and tangy flavor. It had a tingly and dry mouthfeel and was light bodied. This beer left a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass. This is a Lambic-Fruit beer that I would definitely drink again if given the opportunity.","hotstuff","Oct 27, 2003"
4.73,13.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Deep dark red with tons of bubbles. Champagne-like large wispy head that fades to form a quarter inch that stays for the rest of the session. Smell is sour cherry with hints of horse blanket and raw earthy yeast. Taste is sweet for a brief second and then overwhelmingly sour. Sour but dry cherry dominates with more hints of gueze. Dry champagne-like finish. Cherries are real and raw, and the flavors here are amazingly complex and satisfying. An amazing beer!","chaduvel","Oct 27, 2003"
4.82,15.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I recommend drinking this beer at cellar temperature. Cold, it is needlessly dry and only faintly aromatic. Warm, it bursts with rich aromas of giant clods of pressed cherry pulp and baked cheese. On the palate it has the noble richness of aged vinegar and oak barrels combined with vitamin C, sour cherry and dough flavors. There is a distant Luxardo-like cherry pit dimension that shares bitter almond and almond paste nuances, something that adds sweetness as it warms. Extremely persistent, complex and balanced on the finish. I would serve this next time with fish in sauce made from this beer.","putnam","Sep 25, 2003"
4.63,11.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer is a beauty, it pours like a perfectly clear ruby in liquid form. There is perhaps a hint of haze, but you really have to try to see it. This bottle was not highly carbonated, the head is almost non-existent when carefully poured into my glass, it is well carbonated though because when I agitated and swirled the beer it quickly shows a nice pink head. There are notes of sharp acidity in the aroma, musty old barn, a hint of cherry there too. This beer is bone dry, as any authentic lambic should be, and sharply acidic at the front of my mouth, yet it finishes with a mellow acidity and a bit of tannin. In the finish I also find a bit of an astringent cherry pit flavor perhaps (definitely astringent, but is it cherry pit derived). I did not detect this astringency in the Gueuze though. The color and clarity of this beer is stupendous. This is definitely a hard lambic, it does not have much of the soft acidity of some. A hint of cherry at the front of this beer but other than the color, one would be hard pressed to identify this as a fruit beer, much less one made with cherries. Citric acid seems to be the most dominant acid flavor, and I do not detect much in the way of ascetic acid. As this beer warms up the acidity becomes a bit softer, more round, the malt seems to be clamoring for attention a bit more. This beer is still bone dry but the cherry seems to express itself a bit more, in a cherry fruit sweetness sort of way.","Gueuzedude","Sep 24, 2003"
3.31,-20.4,4.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Incredibly shrill and sour in the mouth. Some support from the cherry, but this is really a one note beer right now. Very long, but not very complex. I hope this just needs time in the cellar, as its not up to the level of the gueuze from this fine brewery.","Realale","Sep 22, 2003"

4.55,9.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Oud Beersel's Kriek, packaged in a caged cork 375 ml bottle, pours a brilliant, ruby red grapefruit juice-like hue with a monstrous, bubbly pink colored head that settles into almost nothing. Subtle trails of lace are left down the flute glass. The nose features a musty, extremely sour lambic profile (and rightfully so) that will almost make your eyes water after a long whiff. The taste, after one gets past the tart, sour acidity, is quite nice. Notes of sour cherries, an almost chewy graininess, and hints of oak are evident. The finish is bone dry. This is a complex and refined traditional kriek, to be most certain. The mouthfeel is outstanding, as it coats the palate with a huge effervescence. The acidity, not to be forgotten, cuts right through the palate, as well, leaving its mark. As far as drinkability is concerned, this is quite drinkable for a gueuze lambic veteran. If you can stand the sourness, this is very refreshing, almost like a fresh squeezed lemonade. Highly suggested for fans of traditional lambic.","Jon","Aug 12, 2003"
4.26,2.4,5,4,4,5,4.5,"Red color, cloudy. Head is pinkish and medium. Aroma is wood, old basement mustiness, some fruit and some yeast. WOW Big sour kriek. Cherry flavor is sweet and sour and tart and fruity. Vinegary, woody and earthy. Complex taste. Sweet and sour flavors are well balanced. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a lingering cherry tartness. Very nice beer. It nearly a crime that its not being made any more.","beerguy101","Jun 26, 2003"
3.58,-13.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear brilliant red, with a smallish pink head. Aroma is sweet, lot's of tart cherries, some other fruitiness, and a bit of the barnyard.

4.48,7.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Golden amber hue with excellent clarity when decanted off the sediment. Mountainous, pitted head slowly erodes into persistently frothy, muddled fluff. Waft of vibrantly tart, fresh, but prematurely picked cherries and red currants hit the nose at first. A superceding melange of cheesy old hops, pungent lactic notes and sweaty, enteric ammonification lend an impression of savory, mild blue cheese, which contrasts and offsets the initial brightly tart fruit well. Sharp, acetic tartness a notch shy of pucker inducing bathes the palate at first, then yields to rounder notes of oak aged, still vinegary, young balsamic. Damp, earthy mildew mid palate widens in an agreeably musty suggestions of rain soaked horse and wet cork. A vague grainy, wheat like presence surfaces late along with a resurgence of underripe fruit of a red grape like nature, only to be superceded by an enveloping, yet bone dry, dessicated hay impression. Very well attenuated, superbly crisp and soft on the palate. Finishes expectedly dry, yet complex and oddly lingering, with hints of porous flora laden oak and sour sop. A fabulously balanced, immensely quaffable, well crafted kriek. It has the depth of character of a fine gueuze, and although a kriek, cherry wasn't a dominant flavor component. The microbial community steals the show. Best before March 2022. It's young and will only continue to improve. Delicious!","marc77","Jun 09, 2003"
4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"After a 10 minute reflective period that also served as an acclimation session for my palate, I was able to taste the fruit more clearly. The cherries really did take on sort of a cranberry character. Ive never eaten a sour Belgian cherry, but I assume they dont taste like Bings or Maraschinos ;). Still, the tartness is more reminiscent of the native swamp berry of the Northeastern US. The soft carbonation is very reminiscent of any other Belgian style beer (dubbel or tripel especially) and the licorice-like flavor that emerged late reminded me instantly of Orval. A bit of warmth resulted in very little dulling of Oude Krieks intensity. I was still shaking my head at the end of the bottle","TXHops","May 30, 2003"

4.15,-0.2,5,5,4,4.5,3,"The aroma of this authentic Kreik makes my spine and teeth tingle with anticipation or is that just the tartness I know I'm going to experience? Great lambic aromas of horse blanket, hay, and other barnyard smells. Its deep pink/maroon body contrasts the light pink head. This is very dry, acidic, and tart. A slight cherry flavor is somewhat noticeable. But for me it was a little hard to drink since there was barely any sweetness to balance. Reminded me of the Cantillon Kreik I sampled at the brewery. Very nice, but I'm not quite there yet with my appreciation for the tartness of the authentic lambics.","Longstaff","Apr 03, 2003"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had at the Taste of Belgium event at Celtic Bayou in Redmond, WA... Nice cherry aroma and taste backed up by a surprisingly strong sourness.

4.77,14.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I've had so many sweet semi-lambics lately (ie. Lindemann's) that I was quite relieved when I popped the cork on this and could smell the tartness of the lambic immediately! It's been refrigerated upright for some time, and carefully poured, but the body is still quite hazy. I guess the high level of carbonation pulled it up as soon as the cork was released. The color is a reddish-orange-brown. The head is magnificent, however, with a glowing pink foam that continually holds a densely creamy 3/4" head. The aroma is blessedly sour - it even smells astringent (can it be? Or is that the hay/straw suggesting it to me?!) - and vinous with just a hint of the fruitiness below. The body is thin but the extremely fine & effervescent carbonation (which starts crisp) warms to give it a creaminess that helps it to appear fuller. A mouth-puckering lactic sourness welcomes you to this exquisite gem before warming to reveal all of the standard lambic qualities: woody with loads of oak and and a touch of pine, horseblanket, barn, sweat, leather, earthy, powdery, soapy... an amazing array of flavors. It's surprisingly bone-dry with the cherries lending only a very minor thread to the cloth; and appearing quite vinous, even more like grapes in the finish. An authentic kriek lambic! An astonishingly complex beer that is meant to be mulled over and enjoyed for a good part of the evening. Highly recommended to those who understand geuze and lambic!","NeroFiddled","Nov 30, 2002"
4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Along with the Beersel Oude Gueuze, this is great for its style (in this case a fruit- cherry- lambic). Gets it spot on. Stinky barnyard nose (which i like) Earthy, dry, acidic, sour, grassy, refreshing and just the right amount of cherry flavour to keep you interested, and it ain't sweet which is good, world class kriek-lambic, a must try.","rastaman","Aug 23, 2002"
4.4,5.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Notes: Some like their fruit lambics sweet, this lambic is brewed with sugar but it seems virtually all of the sugars were fermented out leaving it tart and dry. This is the way I like my lambics.","Jason","Jun 26, 2002"
