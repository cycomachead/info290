The nose is powerful and delicious, big, ripe raspberries, jammy with some tart notes in the background.  On the palate, the fruit is much drier and the sour and acid comes through nicely with a nice, yet subtle, dose of funk as well as some spicey, peppery notes.  Clean and refreshing.  A really tasty brew.","mtomlins","Feb 08, 2015"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some lemon and a little bit of grape and vanilla. Lots of tartness in this one!

Stronger than other lambics so it's a little boozy in the finish but other than that a pretty good beer and textbook lambic. Has a strong raspberry taste that is sour/funky but not too strong and has a minor bit of razzy sweetness but not sugary/over sweetened. The tartness is just right for me as I can keep drinking this beer without getting sickened by being over tart/puckering or over sweetened/cloying and a great dessert beer.","clayrock81","Jul 13, 2013"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, fruit, raspberry, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, funk, raspberry, fruit, and very subtle tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Upon taking the first smell on this one I was quite excited as it really reminded me of Rose de Gambrinus minus the usual Cantillon funk. It was also quite a nice looking brew as well. The flavor however had a earthy note to it that cut into some of the sweetness which definitely hurt it slightly for me. I really wish that would not have been the case as besides that this was a really good brew that could have received very high marks from me. Havenâ€™t had it before?
