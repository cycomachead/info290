3.97,7.9,4.25,4,4,4,3.75,"Overall: This brew is pretty enjoyable, considering the ABV. It's a very good lambic that is open to all crowds in the Lambic field. It's not too adventurous and yet it's drinkable beyond repair. I guess what people are looking for nowadays is acidity that will burn both your tastes buds and enamel off your teeth. All in all, this brew is worthy.","Shroud0fdoom","Sep 18, 2014"

Boon Framboise makes for a nice summer treat, occupying a comfortable middle ground between sweet, fruity flavoured lambics and the funky, sour ones at the opposite end of the spectrum. While this is a good beer with a pleasant, tart, vinous flavour, it's not exactly wowing me. I'd be lying if I said I planned to buy it again any time soon, mostly because it's a little pricy in this market, but given the lack of good lambics around here it's still worth a pick-up or two.","thehyperduck","Jun 22, 2014"

There is a bit of oak but otherwise pretty jammy and slightly acetic. Has a slight musty quality and ever so faint bitterness about it but overall this reminds me of a wild raspberry champagne, not that Ive had one to compare. It is not as sweet as other berry lambics, which is refreshing here. I prefer this to the overly sweeter versions. This is a nice, balanced, lambic.","Stinkypuss","May 14, 2014"

High carbonation and relatively light mouthfeel. Always love more raspberry, but overall a refreshing sour here. Not bad, but after a bit there is a strange unpleasant funk left in my mouth.

3.67,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"( 33/50, 5% alc/vol, Home, from 1st Rochester trip) At the top of the glass, the beer becomes a bright and powerful red, but at bottom, it swims a pinkish orange hue. The head of white-orangeish bubbles starts low and stays at a healthy disc of dense bubbles. Good strong aromas of sweet raspberries. Though I would suspect their natural origin. Sour, acidic lambic aromas, well displaying the oak maturation. Smells creamy, sorbetlike. Like a raspberry yogourt. Slightly sulfurous, acrid raspberry flavours. Dry, oaky, old lambic acids come up with a metallic, odd bile-like acrid flavour. They smells right, but they don’t taste fresh at all. Still, as you finish the bottle, it gets easier and easier to handle. Great natural raspberry sediment. Acidic and sour, but the sourness is at an odds with something in the beer. The raspberry bitterness seems like raisin tannins. Acrid and powerful. Leaves a dry impression and robs a bit from the fruitiness. Sample is a year old, from the shelf of Beers of the world! So handling might have been an issue. This lambic would be much, much better served fresh in a barrel. This sample is a far ways from the coasts of Belgium. Would warrant another try. Otherwise, fresh red fruit-seeds, raw lambic acidity and a sulfurous, bile bitterness that puts us at odds with nice fruity flavours, oaked and aged.","iguenard","Apr 02, 2011"

2.86,-22.3,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Smells lightly funky with lots of sweet raspberry aromas. Lightly sweet with a bit of raspberry seed taste to go along with the raspberry fruit flavor. A bit of sour acidity as well as a faintly musty taste. Fairly simple for a lambic type beer. A light red color that shows brilliantly clear.","Gueuzedude","May 23, 2003"
2.9,-21.2,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2,"The mouthfeel is thin, but leaves a fruity residual taste behind, again, very wine-like. I guess if you're into this sort of thing, this would be drinkable for you, but it's not my cup of tea. It's not unpleasant, but perhaps it's more an acquired taste I'll work on. I have some Lindeman's Kriek, Geuze, and Framboise in the mini-fridge, we'll see what happens...","brewdlyhooked13","Feb 26, 2003"
4.35,18.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pink/red, cloudy brew with a pink top. Aroma of raspberries and lambic sour/mustiness that's expected out of the glass. There may be even a hint of woodiness in the aroma. The body starts out med/light with a good wheat/malt base to balance the slightly sweet but potently sour raspberry flavor. It finishes dry and lemony and the carbonation seems to add complexity to the flavors on the tongue. I do like the sweet/sourness of this one and generally like all the Boon beers, highly recommended for the lambic explorers.","jeffboo","Feb 26, 2003"
3.48,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Got this for my girlfriend and she liked it alot,poured a raberry-red with a bg fluffy head.Had kind of a musty smell wich was more preverlant to me than the rasberry smell.Started off very sweet like rasberry syrup almost but finished with some nice tartness.Almost sticky sweet,a little too fufu I guess for me,seemed real drinkable though.","oberon","Feb 24, 2003"
3.87,5.2,3.5,4,4,3,4,"As Im in a bit of a sour mood, I thought this evenings samplings should all be Lambics, so here goes number two. A deep sanguineous color on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy in its consistency, the color a winsome raspberry red, as it evanesces quite quickly, the resultant lace a bit thin and clumpy. As one would expect the nose is like smelling a Raspberry tart, sweet and sour, crisp and clean, and a real treat for the beezeer. Start is ambrosial, chased quickly by the tartness, top is slender in feel, with the finish astringent, raspberry sweet, tart and quite dry, once again a quite good lambic, not great just quite pleasant to the palate","Gusler","Jan 11, 2003"
3.78,2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Hazy ruby raspberry red. Purple tinged white head recedes steadily into a thin, spotty layer that leaves sparse foam aggregates. Vibrant, freshly pressed ripe raspberries hit the nose at first, then are ceded by mellow lactic tartness and subdued hints of damp wool and must. A mildly tart lactic wash initially in flavor fades into a sweet and sour melange of ripe, sweet raspberry and sour, citric kumquats. Understated, ghostly wisps of dryish, bready grain emerge late. Light in body, but with a pleasantly smooth, coating mouthfeel. Finishes with a snap of fruity fructose sweetness that yields to drying, clean tartness. Quite an enjoyable lambic. It's not overly complex and seems intermediate in character between the cloyingly sweet Lindemans and the puckeringly deeply tart classics. Boon Framboise nonetheless retains an elegant quaffability.","marc77","Dec 28, 2002"
3.55,-3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Smellability is high, but drinkability is pretty low due to so-so taste, and disappointing mouthfeel. Certainly not up to Boon Kriek or Marriage Parfait in my book.","Realale","May 23, 2002"
3.23,-12.2,3.5,3,3,3,4,"Compared to the Lindemans this frambroise is a little thin in body and flavor. A really nice red color with a sweet reapberry nose. I thought that the taste was a little thin not much fruit more of a champagney taste to it. Worth a try but only once.","Reverand","Apr 22, 2002"
3.97,7.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"You think its gonna be sweet when you smell it, but its only slightly sweet at the start, then tart, slightly sour and lots of fruit, very nice and refreshing.","rastaman","Beers"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Raspberry and astringent nose (wild yeast).  amber in color with a white lace.  Malty slight raspberry taste followed by slight bitter finish.  Not as sweet or as tart as lindemans.","frank4sail","0"
