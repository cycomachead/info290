3.11,-24.3,4.5,3.5,2.75,3.5,2.75,"This beer is very difficult for me to rate and should probably be taken with a "grain of salt".  It hits all of the marks of the style (e.g. look, funky/fruity smell, funky/tart flavor, etc.) and is probably an extremely solid option for those who love sours.  I have enjoyed sours, but I much prefer that the sourness itself be on the milder end of the spectrum.  This beer was just a bit too much for me to handle in terms of tartness.","Gaddabble","Mar 22, 2015"

It tastes much better than the scent, a strong cherry flavor which surprises you with a strong tart bite, not a bad one though, I was just used to lindemans kriek which is a lot more sweet.

Sour and puckering, with a nice depth of aroma and a nice dry finish that entices the next sip in spite of the aggressive sourness. I don't know what this one tastes like fresh, but honestly, I don't care. It's fantastic with over a year on it, and I will have to make a point to grab bottles of this when I see it around town. It's an acceptable substitute for it's more famous Belgian sour beer making counterparts, and more readily available.","LambicPentameter","May 05, 2014"

4.1,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in February 2013. Pours fairly clear ruby red color with a 2 finger dense pink head with poor retention, that reduces to a lacing ring that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of sour cherry, cherry skin, cranberry, green apple, grape, pear, clove, pepper, oak, leather, straw, hay, red wine, vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of cherry, wild/lactic yeast, and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, cherry skin, cranberry, green apple, pear, red wine, oak, clove, straw, grass, hay, vinegar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, oak, clove, red wine, leather, vinegar, straw, hay, and musty funk on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of cherry, oak, and wild/lactic yeast flavors; with a very nice malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent sour kriek style. All around great complexity and balance of cherry, oak, and lactic/wild yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 01, 2013"

Poured this at a good temperature with an amazing roiling head that is maintained by the incredible effervescence of this wonderful brew! No lace, clear amber cherry color and loads of teeny bubble trails. Aroma is cherry, musk, yeast, oak, vinegar. Flavor is brut champagnesque with a demure cherry presence and the yeast bitterness is exactly matched by the small sharp peaks of tartness from carbonic acid and wild yeast. Finish is like flavor, gradually diminishes, and is satisfying.","drpimento","Oct 22, 2012"

The taste has a bit more cherry in it than the smell would suggest, but overall it's a pretty light beer. The sourness is pretty strong, but it ends up being a very nice refreshing beer. The carbonation helps give it a bit of lift as well.

Smell good: even though its made from cherries, I get a strong strawberry aroma. Highly acid just in the nose. Taste is tart and fruity, yet very dry. Only slightly carbonated. Flavor is darker fruitiness than smell. I believe the smell is mostly yeast and bacteria where the flavor pushes the actual fruit. Wide range of mouthfeels, lots of lactic acid.

4.27,3.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A bit of vinegar in the finish, like a flander's red. This was a bit less desirable for me. Funky cherries. The most striking part of the beer was the very strong sourness, and the very soft, round mouthfeel. Would still drink this often if I could! I do wish the cask could be kept a bit cooler somehow.","voteforgoat","Sep 18, 2011"
4.25,3.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Conclusion: This is an awesome kriek, and one that I imagine would benefit from aging. The aroma is my favorite part of this beer. The flavor seems to me to be masked by the intense tartness and sourness, but know the little know about the blenders that made this, I think that the end product is exactly what they intend it to be, so I will strive to appreciate what they produce. If you are a lover of traditional lambic or of wild ales in general, I recommend you try this as soon as possible.","allforbetterbeer","Sep 09, 2011"

4.39,6.8,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"O: This beer is a perfect example of what over a century of traditional Belgian brewing can yield. This beer is perfectly crafted not only in the way it’s spontaneously fermented and blended with cherries but how it’s aged in barrels and then bottle conditioned. After all that, it comes out nearly crystal clear, with head, great carbonation and an amazinlgy crisp, refreshing taste. I can find it locally, but it takes time. This beer is amazing. 5","julian","Aug 29, 2011"

With some carbonation I'm sure this is a much better beer, but as a flat beer it's very rough to drink. The acidity is very taxing on the back of the throat, and the tartness makes it feel like force-fed medicines. I could get this thing down if it was a magical elixir to cure all my problems, but otherwise this isn't drinking very well.

Obviously cherries, lots of barnyard funk, humid earth. Appearance: Beautiful red pour with decent white head. Flavors: Very sour but still enjoyable. Mainly wood flavors, some medicinal herbs. Cherries faded quite a bit. Something a little harsh about it. Palate: One of the driest beer I’ve had, low carbonation. Overall: Very interesting experiment.

The cherry character is about as far from bright as you can possibly get. The palate opens with a blend of funk, cherries and noticeable sulfur. Rather fart-like, the sulfur gets in the way of enjoyability of the beer. Lots of sour cherry with leather and oak. Moderate vinegar, fruity acidity, this is mildly watery on the finish.

It tastes of subtle sour cherries with a light sweet tart esque finish. It drinks kind of watery in consistency but it easy to drink. Overall this is a pretty lackluster Kriek.

This beer pours an almost-clear, bright, ruby red color with absolutely no head whatsoever...thats why I chose to do this one now. I hope the other bottle will have better carbonation. Scent is very lovely with some amazing tart cherry aromas and a ton of FUNK. Hints of oak and balsamic vinegar. Taste is just mind-blowing. So many amazing flavors. The cherry is spot-on and just makes for a perfect Kriek beer. Amazing sour, barnyard funkiness with some delightful oak and lactic acid. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with no carbonation whatsoever. The sourness I just tingling all over my mouth from the inside of my cheeks to my teeth.

Nice, but nothing super special. The flavor was very nice and refreshing and complex with good cherry and acetic and lactic acid, and some tannic red wine flavors. Pleasant and refreshing.

I'm not sure about the cherry flavor itself, however. It comes through quite pleasantly sometimes, but then it is sometimes very medicinal.

The cherries start the party off, promising a sweetness that dives down underneath the sharp, apple-like sour note that comes on. Oddly enough, subsequent sips find the sourness disappearing rapidly & just leaving the crispness. I feel like I've got a sourness hangover, somehow. The aftertaste is malty and pleasant, really taking the edge off the finish. Really, really remarkable. The mouthfeel is slippery and light but not watery. Nice carbonation.

Light-bodied and smooth, slightly creamy even, with a good cherry taste that is slightly sour and sharp due to carbonation. Smooths as it warms, although ABV is slightly noticeable as you take your time. Hints of some earthy hops in there as well and cherry gives off some sweetness, but mostly this is a more dry, sour beer that is to be sipped like a red wine.

The aroma is nice and sour, earthy, with mouth-watering sour cherry that opens my nostrils like menthol. Insanely pungent sour cherries pinch my salivary glands and tingle the back of my throat on the way down. There are hints of wildness and oak that blend well with the extreme acidity, and little, if any, residual sweetness.

Flavors are intensly cherries, vineousness, acidity, woodsy, white grapes, kiwi, and lemon zest. Mouth puckering astringency awaits in the mouthfeel, but totally expected.

The taste was very tart at first, since I was expecting a bit of mellowness since this was a 3 year aged bottle. Once it warmed up some, the tartness grew on me. I think the rookies took a liking to it, and I was glad to introduce them to a new style of beer.

Describing these wild Belgian beers can be difficult because they provide an experience beyond any other beer experience. The aroma starts with a bowl of sour cherries. Now rip a cherry sapling out of the ground and pound the cherries with the dirty roots. Then take the bowl into an old, well used horse stable and sit down next to the water trough. The stable is decorated with garlands of blooming cherry branches, and sage and bay leaves. Now breathe deep. You will smell the horses, the straw, the fruit essences, and the well water with herbal and compost overtones. This is so sour my face is twitching. I think I taste sodden old barn beams. I taste green apples and green plums, wild cherries, pineapple sage and shiso, and sour whey. Whew, this beer is a challenge. I think it cries for shellfish and seafood.

Pronounced wet horse blanket and musty hay in aroma, contrasted by a vibrantly tart impression of immature, budding cherries. Subtle sherryish oxidation notes and a bittersweet lactic presence surfaces as it breathes. Intense and enticing aromawise. Acerbic acetic acid bath incipient in flavor is ensued and offset by sweetly woody cork and hints of grainy wheat. Tartness begrimes somewhat mid palate, with enteric, bile acid notes competing with citric, fruit derived tartness for dominance. Fruit presence is surprisingly tepid in outright cherry character, and at least when combined with the microflora derived fermentation end products is more of a pucker inducing, sour citrus kuwkuat nature. Woodiness augments slightly late, and a vinous, oak aged sherry vinegar impression forms late. Quite dry overall, yet a soft viscosity is acheived in mouthfeel. Finishes with a nearly seemless tart extension, albeit with a slightly sweet balsamic tinge. Hanssens Oude Kriek is almost a great lambic. Fruit flavor and bacterial acidity haven't quite coalesced yet. Superbly tart and satiating nonetheless. With cellaring this will be top notch.","marc77","Oct 12, 2003"

Despite the impressive pop, the beer poured without a head, only a wispy ring. The body itself was hazy and pink, but it was tinted slightly brown. The beer smelled like sour, dusty cherries. Very nice. This was what a kriek should be. Tart with nice black cherry flavor. It wasnt sweet at all, but as it warmed a little bit of sugar came out. Thankfully this beer never came close to Lindemans.","yen157","Mar 30, 2003"
4.27,3.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This lambic poured a clear, reddish amber color (more towards amber than red), with a trace of white foam. The aroma was evident from the moment the bottle was uncorked: a very tart/sour smell (similar to a Gueze) with only a hint of dark cherries and some musty grapes. The taste was very tart, and cherries take a back seat. This is not a sweet Kriek. Other flavors were oak, musty grapes, wild yeast, apples, and some earthy flavors. The mouthfeel was typical for a lambic, but this one was a bit puckering, though crisp and clean. The drinkability was very good, though this one was closer to a Gueze than to a Kriek that I am familiar with. I guess I am getting to like the more tart lambics after repeated exposure.","UncleJimbo","Mar 22, 2003"
3.51,-14.6,3.5,2.5,4,4,3.5,"Sour! The scent reminds me of amishland outside of Philly close to where I grew up. It wasn't very pleasing, rather tough to breathe in. But then the taste. The flavors are very much enjoyable. Very sour cherries, smooth mouthfeel, and a dry finish. I'm amazed that something that smells this weird can taste this good. Lambics definitely need some time to grow on me. This one was rough at first, but as I drank a few more small pours, it got better.","AudioGilz","Feb 22, 2003"

4.32,5.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Clear and deep harvest orange body, with a few strong trails of CO2. Small, fizzy head. Moderate head retention, witha a thin lace continually remaining atop the brew. Richy, musky, horse-blankety aroma with strong undertones of tart cherry and light hints of spicy hops. Very sour flavor, rich in tart cherries. CO2 makes a big statement in the slightly oily mouthfeel. This seems to me to be what a true fruit lambic is all about!","Viking","Nov 29, 2002"
4.4,7.1,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Pours a hazy reddish orange color with a big, slightly red tinged, white foamy head that soon subsides down to a thin film. Classic lambic aromas of musty air, barnyard, hay, blankets, and sour aromas are accompanied by a nice tart cherry twinge. Quick sour cherry taste bites the tongue and slightly puckers the cheeks. Musty basement tastes, kind of like my parents cellar a few days after a bad rainstorm and the cellar has finally dried out, along with some great lip puckering sourness slowly work on your cheeks until they are completely shriveled up and sunk in. Barnyard and decaying hay smells are present as well but are slightly subdued by the cherry flavors. The cherrys ride through in the background before coming back to the forefront in the finish with a quick sweet tartness. Nicely medium to light bodied with great lip puckering and tongue shrivelling properties, although not quite as tart as I like it. An absolute joy to drink, Lambics by themselves are almost reason enough to move to Belgium.","Murph","Nov 23, 2002"
4.1,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very interesting stuff, really smelly barnyard/dirty nappy nose, quite balsamic acidity, with a soft cherry aroma noticed. Sour, of course, the way it should be, dry. Nice balance of kriek flavour in their, just the right amount, a very nice kriek lambic, if only i could get it down under, i miss Belgium.","rastaman","Sep 27, 2002"
