As it was poured into a pint glass, the color arranged itself into a nice, murky, hazy reddish-orangish-slightly-brownish hue. I examined its innards and saw a little bit of what looked like strawberry seeds floating. As I brought the glass to my lips, that musty aroma I first smelt became strong with force. It tickled the inside of my nose and I could almost taste the concoction on the back of my tongue. The first sip just about made me cough. In a good, exciting way. The first flavor I noticed was a green olive, acidic, vinegarish taste. I was oddly intrigued by this as I usually discern these flavors in my beer. But I LIKED it! As I got through and through this bottle, those strawberry notes became more apparent. And by the end, my throat was scorched, my palate was wrecked, and I was internally satisfied. I even let my room mate try a sip (who does not drink craft beer regularly) and it almost made him throw up.","HellSludge","Jul 22, 2014"

3.8,1.9,3,4.25,3.75,3,4,"like nothing else on the market, one of the best uses of strawberries I have ever come across. pours dense and golden, pushing brassy, with some more sediment as the bottle gets low. literally no head or bubbles at all, completely still, not totally appealing to be honest, but I trust its sourness right away. as soon as the cork is off, this beer starts emitting tartness and funky sour all over the shop. I can smell it in my jawline, a mouthwatering brew here, with unripe fruit and lacto notes, as well as some oak, complex and just so damn sour, consecration style. the taste comes in two waves. the first is a berry, but not specifically strawberry tartness, fresh and addicting, sour of course, but not as pucker as the nose. some wheat malt and long fermentation characteristics are evident, as well as an acidity that is quite intense. the second wave, after a second or so pause, is a full bore watery mouth, salivation and drool from the sourness finally catches up with me, its about as much as my palate can handle. like strawberries that are still pink and white, although if I didn't know it, im not sure I would have been able to say strawberry specifically. I hate that its still though, it needs bubbles to percolate this into my palate, and its obviously missing. it needs to move, and it stagnates. still, the acidity is enough to make it finish quickly and drink easy enough. one of the more sour beers ive had, and a great use of fresh fruit. expensive but worth it to try.","StonedTrippin","Dec 06, 2013"

Taste is light, mildly sour, and has a mellowness to it that I have not had in this style before. I'm not sure I would have identified strawberry if it weren't noted on the label, as it is not a strong, powerful flavor. However, knowing they were in the mix, you get a sense of "oh yeah, I can get a taste of them" as the sour element fades away into just a light, barely-present sour coating on your tongue and teeth.

The nose is what I expected from Hannsens, nice acidity, moderate funk, and a strawberry juice aspect that offers a touch of berry sweetness. The flavors are interested. Of course there is the acid and funky yeast but it has an odd juicy strawberry sweetness. It's kind of earthy and vinous. The mouthfeel is also a little flat. It's ok. I know there aren't many strawberry lambics out there but to me this tastes like a Geueze with Strawberry juice added. It's ok but being more expensive than their gueuze or kriek, I would prefer one of those any day.","aasher","Jul 04, 2012"

Given the aromas and flavors and some of the descriptions I read before buying it I didn’t expect to enjoy it so much, but I think that this beer suffers from the inadequacy of words alone to convey the rich complexity of a sensory experience like this. I won’t hesitate to buy another bottle of this one when I encounter it. Its not something for every night but it is definitely a treat. My overall impression is of a beer that is extraordinarily complex and that I personally am giving high marks based on that complexity and the fact that I’m enjoying this one so much.","drtth","Sep 28, 2011"

The strawberry comes in to only partially sweeten the sour. Earthy funky musty come through before once again turning tart and lingering on the palette long after every sip.

I feel like it ate everything there was to eat in the ten years in the bottle. Very very dry. Brett lends an interesting cherry flavor. Oakiness is apparent. Very sour and highly acidic. Mouthfeel is thin, like what I would expect in a Saison. Only a very slight strawberry flavor to speak of. It could be placebo and my brain wanting the berry flavor.","mlazzaro","Apr 05, 2011"

Very skunky, very sour, very musty, very funky, very salty - all in a horrible and disgusting way. This is one of the worst tasting beers I have ever had. Just layer upon layer of awful. Beer is absolutely flat, which makes the taste that much worse. It's like a big glass of flat vinegar soda mixed with fermented strawberry mold. Overall, this is an abomination of a beer.

Hard to process. I think I might be blind. This is about the most sour thing I've ever tasted. There is a shadow of woody oak that reaches out of the back of my throat and tries to strangle me. Beer is also thicker than I thought it would be but still finishes really dry. The second drink was much better than the first. Its mellowing and growing on me. Strawberries? Really? I don't think so. This is like a harsh, sour, tart, unblended, flat lambic. I like it.","drabmuh","Feb 09, 2011"

It's got that deep, refreshing tartness that you only smell in the best lambics. Flavor packs a nice sour wallop with ultra-tart strawberry notes and that dried strawberry sweetness. A little unripe stone fruit at times and a bit of hay bale as well. Once the tongue acclimates to the sourness, some honeyed malts come through to provide a touch of balance. A completely still beer, but the sourness acts in place of CO2 to refresh the palate. Very dry despite a body medium in heft.","illidurit","Jan 21, 2011"

Strong aroma of sourness mixed with fruit, in this case strawberry. Some vinegar noted in the nose. Tart and dry are the 2 words that come to mind after my first sip. Some acetone flavors as well. The zero carbonation doesn't help really although I realize that no carbonation is typical of this age and maybe style. The more I have it the more I kind of like it.

Has a nice bit of 'funk' in here as well. As the bottle drains, it becomes more tart than sour as the palate adjusts fairly quickly to the sour aspect. There is also a mild rubbery flavor that has me thinking brettomyces might be involved here. I wish I had 20 more of these around, awesome beer.

For a Hanssens lambic, this smells surprisingly mellow, and it is so on the palate as well, with a fairly oak and vanilla forward lambic base with a sourness that brings to mind rotting lemons, less some sweetness, and some lactic acid. Fairly slick on the palate. The strawberries are still fairly noticeable on the palate, lending a sweetness and acidity to complement the lemony lambic. Funk character is quite low here, apart from a mild earthiness on the mid-palate, there isn't much. This is one aspect that I wish had a little more complexity to it. Quite oaky on the finish with vanilla and tannins to add the low level of carbonation that's present. Oh, and it doesn't really need much carbonation for the flavor profile IMO.

Aromas of light, sweet strawberry up front, followed by a nice mellow sourness and some funky barnyard smells. Classic. The taste is similar- sweet strawberry turns to sour funk while in the mouth with the typical slightlt bitter taste of damp hay and horseblanket right at the end.

I am no novice to lambic, but this one is still kicking me a bit hard. After that initial taste, the buds seem used to it more and you get a less abrasively sour tone and a bit of wet wood. Very minimal fruit influence here. Barely visible to the palate. Feel is extremely low on carbonation. So much so that it might not even feel like there is some to certain people.

At least the mouth-puckering, sweaty look that I'm giving. Mildly salty, musty, and earthy with some other flavors that I detect before my tastebuds give up.

Sweaty brett funk finishes out the bouquet. Brash flavor up front. Impudently tart in a nearly cloying (but not quite) way: slight acetic twang accompanies a sour grape and underripe raspberry acidity. Paint-stripping dryness in the finish, which is quite tannin-heavy, fairly woody, and slightly peppery. Phenolic funk all the way through the swallow. This beer's weakest point is its mouthfeel. It's got the dryness I enjoy in lambics, but its complete lack of carbonation makes each sip rather heavy and slick. Very much like a brett-infected dry white wine -- to my palate, at least.

What an amazing aroma: musty and earthy with a serious acidic note. A very nice strawberry nose comes through almost immediately, and was far stronger than I expected. It smelled vaguely like small wild strawberries, not the plump farm variety. The taste is very nice: sour and earthy. Musty, funky, mouth-puckering, and dry. The strawberry flavor is very prominent in the taste as well. Medium mouthfeel, dry and tart finish. This is an interested beer. I was impressed with the strength of the strawberries and how they worked well with flavor of the brew.

The fruit is not as pronounced as some lambics I've had. It goes down slow and very tart. Usually, these brews go down like water, but this one is different. The mouthfeel is fine.

Starts off with nice fruit notes, probably strawberries (based on the label only, not my tastebuds) and segues into a graceful sourness...and then...bam! the sour comes in heavy and somewhat artificial. It's puckering, but doesn't seem natural. Mouthfeel, especially early on, is medium. The heavy duty puckering keeps this from being an easy quaff.","pentathlete","Apr 01, 2005"

Sweet to tart ratio is right on with lots of bittersweet strawberry. I detect a slight bit of woody smokiness well into the aftertaste. A little syrupy, the carbonation is really low so it doesn't hide it very well. The strawberry seems to be a niche kind of flavor for people. I like strawberries, but this beer seems to posess some bubblegummy sweetness. Rather enjoyable, overall. A must-have for lovers of the strawberry and lambic beers.","crookedhalo","Dec 23, 2004"
3.94,5.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a flat deep orange color with absolutely no head or lacing. Aromas are quite interesting for such a brew, consisting mostly of sweet floral tones and passion fruits. There are some slight acidic tones but there's just so much sweetness in the nose that it keeps these tones at bay. Flavors start off quite sweet and fruity, with flavors that just remind me of a tropical summer day and eating passion fruits. Somewhere in the mix there is an acetic tone within but for the most part it is subdued by the sweetness. The finish is slightly earthy and floral, reminding me of fresh dandelions, oak, and strawberry fields. There is also just the slightest tone of vanilla to go along with the strong sour and acetic flavors. The carbonation to this brew was just a trickle and the mouthfeel was just a bit thin. Overall this has got to be one of the most interesting lambics I have ever tasted.. I have never had one that was soo sweet and fruity while having such burst of acetic and sour tones..

The middle is flat and funky with some fermenting (almost rotting) fruit. The finish has a full fruitiness with alcohol and becomes puckeringly sour. Burning throat sour. Complex, fruity, tart.

The aroma catches up for the looks though with its straightforward strawberry pie nuances. Captivating sweet/tart combat. Almost as candyish as if lindemans had done it, but theres still a hint of that hanssens funk though it would score much higher with me if this wasnt restrained so much. Actually hints of sugar powder. Palate is actually very tart. Agressively acidic finish with obvious strawberries, but like my pal martin pointed out, it just doesnt procures the classy combination cherries or raspberries do. Puckering grapeish finish, decent dose of lactic funk, unusually dry finish which seems to arrive from nowhere with such a fruity start.

Nose contains pervasive notes of strawberries, a musty barnyard aroma, and hints at some sour acidity to come. Flavors include a huge strawberry profile in addition to notes of apple and pear -- imparted by the yeast -- and a very nice sweet-and-sour interplay throughout. Very tart, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is mildly effervescent at first, but turns more vinous as it settles. This is a unique, excellent vintage lambic.

Sweet, ripe, sugary strawberries hit the nose at first, then are ceded by notes of yeast must, bready grain, and lactic tartness, with hints of wet horse and trace aged, cheesy hops emerging towards the end of the aroma. In flavor, the initial snap of fruit sweetness is quickly overrun by a nearly puckering tartness. Fruit flavor is not lost amongst the tart character, and strawberry persists throughout, albeit in an unripe fashion. The hint of diacetyl adds a creamy, buttery undertone that supplements the lactic tartness and prevents it from being overbearing and one dimensional. "Wild" Brettanomyces yeast emerges as mild notes of wet hay. As my palate becomes accustomed to the tartness, fruitiness reverts to a freshly picked strawberry nature. Spot on in body-- light, somewhat spritzy, but not at all weak or watery. Finishes simultaneously sweet, tart and dry. Oudbeitje is a complex and delicious lambic. The interplay of sweet fruitiness and lactic tartness teases the palate in a capricious way. The real deal.","marc77","Oct 05, 2002"

The acidity was still quite high (good), sourness was prevalant at first, but the tinge of strawberries invaded in the middle and balanced the dryness at the end to a rather sharp but sweet finish.

The body is thin and the mouthfeel is powdery. The flavor starts with a soft acidity which immediately turns quite sharp on the front of the tongue - puckering, leading into some light fruit flavor (wow!?!) and some broader flavors of limited residual sugar, leather, mustiness as the liquid warms across the palate, then dissolves from the tongue with a quickly passing light metallic note, leaving a dry, powdery finish and a "sour spot" at the back of the throat. Surprisingly not astringent, as it's often expected. Not a very complex lambic, but quite surprising in the clarity of the strawberry note (a difficult fruit to work with because of it's light character).","NeroFiddled","0"
