3.89,1.8,3.75,4,3.75,4,4,"as lambics go, im not sure this is my favorite, not tart enough, not acidic hardly at all, and lacking the wild fermentation characteristics i usually look for in the style, but as a fruited belgian ale, i absolutely love it, and its head and shoulders better than its immediate peers. natural looking purple pink raspberry color, a short lived stained pink head, and some chunks of yeast and maybe even a few raspberry seeds in there, it looks the part. the nose is great, jammy but not overly sweet, authentic fruity character and a little belgian yeast funk and fruit, but not the sourness true lambic usually possesses. i love the fruit flavor, not quite as true as the nose, mellowed by an oak hit here, but its still the chief flavor agent, and a genuine one at that. no corn sugar, no cavities, just true raspberry beer. its affordable and tasty, well carbonated and light, and overall extremely well made for what it is. not really passable as a sour, but im not sure its trying to be one. highly respectable brew here, better than some of the other fruit editions i think too, really summery and real fruity, i almost feel guilty for liking this as much as i do...","StonedTrippin","Feb 08, 2014"

3.45,-9.7,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Picked it at the Gourmet Store at Siam Discovery in Bangkok. I was preparing for a romantic evening with my lady on the 58th Floor Club Room of the Lebua State Tower on the Chao Phraya riverfront. A fruit lambic ?? Always works. Split the beer into two small but sturdy pours into the available wine glasses. The liquid was a bursting rosy red crowned with a shouting pink head. Hardly any retention and no lacing at all. This was a little comical as I found the appearance to be very child friendly. The nose was full of raspberry tartness. This didn't smell like a beer at all, except for the yeast aroma that was unmistakably Belgianesque. For me, thats when the love affair and appreciation ended (for the beer) - the taste was too sweet for my liking, like a raspberry candy. Maybe i was not used to lambics, but this tasted artificially sweet. Of course, it was tart as hell, thankfully to give some credibility to the taste. Beer was medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, I wouldn't go out of the way looking out for this one again, though it definitely is a lady pleaser, and maybe suitable for an after dinner sit out.","BeerSingh","Aug 26, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberries, strawberries, and cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I really enjoyed this one as a nice palate cleanser as it was not abrasive to the tongue at all and left a rather pleasant aftertaste. The fruit on this one was definitely the start of the show as one would expect from this style. This is a definite must try and could be a good gateway brew for some females who are fans of fruitier mixed drinks.","thagr81us","Aug 06, 2011"

Same thing with the flavor, as a cloying sweetness overshadows the fresh taste of the raspberries. Syrupy and a bit too thick on the palate, a re-chracterization of this beer would do it good. If you like sweet fruit beers, this is one to try.

The taste emphasizes the berries' tart and sour qualities, but does not overdo it as these temper/mellow as things progress. The oak from the nose is there as well, creating a soft boat upon which the berries float across the tongue.

4.07,6.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinks like a sweet mixed drink, but a REALLY good one. Some might think it's just a sweet lambic, but it does have more going for it than just a sweet outside. Plus it's darn tasty on a hot summer day, but I think it would also go quite well on a cool winter night. (Possibly in front of a fire....some music...yeah...)","Dubbercody","Nov 19, 2005"

4.4,15.2,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Well worth the price, as this is not sold where I live. An absolutely delicous lambic. Wonderfully tart & sweet at the same time, but keeps an excellent balance, not tipping one way or the other. Light but not wimpy, absolutely refreshing. I could drink this stuff like it was juice. And I do. Liquid candy.","chOAKbarrell","Jul 13, 2005"

3.7,-3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Had this on-tap at Roman's Pub. It certainly has an interesting appearance; whether it's good or not depends on if you think cough syrup is attractive. It was capped by a very pink head that reminded me, morbidly, of the bloody froth that comes from people's mouths after a lung injury. Smells and tastes almost of straight raspberry, with a slight hint of a perfumy, floralness. You might think you were drinking pleasantly carbonated raspberry juice. It was so fruity that my girlfriend had to move on to "something more beery" after the first glass, which wasn't even a regular glass, maybe 8 oz. Basically, if you like raspberries, you will like this beer; otherwise, you will probably get sick to your stomach. Hell, you might get sick anyway, even if you do like raspberries.","battlekow","Beers"
