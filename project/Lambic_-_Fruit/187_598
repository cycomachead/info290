I suppose in a blind taste test with this and peach soda, I would notice some more differences.  Nice sour balance to the sweet, but very little in the way of complexity.  Tasty?  Yes.  This is probably my wife's favorite "beer."  It just seems to be a one-trick sweet peach pony.","captaincoffee","Mar 31, 2015"

APPEARANCE: light body of a wheat ale or cider, with subtle effervescence and slightly hazy; fizzy white head holds steady to a half-inch of significantly creamy, clouding to-finger smear; ... AROMA: immediate peach, a basket in each nostril, with secondary apple and yeasty funk not polluting the overall experience... PALATE: soft as flower petals; dry at its end, with some bubbly flourish; creamy, reasonably bodied for a lambic...TASTE: sweet and strong peach, with a metallic, earthy base that gives the experience backbone; easily sippable, with hints of orange peel., mango and tartness..OVERALL: a perfect compliment to the levity of the day; specialized flavor for special occasions--slightly pricey but enjoyable...","dacrza1","Feb 14, 2015"

Aromas of rich, hearty peach, with an effervescent tartness that borders on sour. The nose is light enough that it avoids being overpowering like some Lambics. Flavors of subtle roast with a peach flavor that honestly tastes like fresh pureed peaches. Very authentic and balanced. Wow. Smooth bodied, light, and crisp, making it very easy to drink. The aftertaste is subtle rich and sweet peach, with a slight linger after the clean, smooth finish. Very easy to drink, and very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Jun 26, 2013"

Very—overly—sweet with the flavor of an almost-artificial ripened peach on the palate. Think something along the lines of a peach jam in terms of sweetness. It is crisp and an easy drinker but that does not make this one I’d seek out again.","elNopalero","Jan 17, 2013"

The downfall is just the massive sugar content, and it is oh so prevalent in the mouthfeel, like you're drinking a peach lemonade or something, but without even the tartness of something like lemonade can bring. I like it more than the other sugary lambics lindeman's offers, but I think this would just be so good if they cut down on the sugar and amped up the tartness in these.","Beerandraiderfan","Oct 10, 2012"

A bouquet of fresh cut peaches erupted from the glass. It does not really smell like beer, but that is how lambics are supposed to be. The initial taste is tart peaches with honey and a hint of cinnamon. The peach hits the sour buds on the tongue making them tingle with the sour sensation. My great disappointment with this beer is that the flavor did not last long as the carbonation brushed the peaches away quickly, leaving a somewhat watery aftertaste. The tart peach notes are present, but not with the same level of intensity.","JohnnyHopps","Aug 04, 2012"

It also may be worth mentioning that this has been my introduction to Brouwerij Lindemans, a brewery I expect to drinking a lot of now! While it may not satisfy the connoisseur in search of a intense sour, this lambic has been thoroughly satisfying for me. Despite the overbearing sweetness in the flavor profile, it remains quite drinkable; but then again, how could a 4.0% ABV sunshine-fruity sugar bomb not?

4.11,4.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall Impression- The best Lambic so far from Lindemans! No wonder it has taken me almost 6 months to find this. Actually, I probably could have just called around to local liquor stores and eventually found it but it was cooler to have stumbled upon it at a beer bar with friends. Would recommend this one for sure but not @ the $16 price. I bet you could buy this from $10-12.","DCon","Oct 02, 2011"

Very carbonated with a crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good lambic and probably my other favorite besides the framboise. Really nice peach aromas and flavors on this one.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 26, 2011"

3.22,-18.1,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Pouring clear orange with a thin, wispy, white head that falls off to a ring leaving minimal lacing, this looks pretty decent. The nose is moderately sweet in a fruity way, with plenty of peach character present. In some ways, this is like peach juice, with a little bit of lemon and just a wisp of barnyard present. Surprisingly complex, IMO. The palate, though, is a lot sweeter. That aspartame sweetness is prominent, rather artificial and takes away from the fruit character. It also hides any lambic character that's present. Sweet on the finish, this medium-light bodied beer is moderately carbonated and finishes sweet. Decent, this is better as an accompaniment with a dessert where it's lack of complexity can be hidden.","DefenCorps","Jun 02, 2011"
4.42,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: I would say this beer is dangerously drinkable. It's got a great scent to it, matching flavors and pretty low ABV...

Smell seems to mostly be in the sourness. My first so I would say this is good. Has a super nice sourness with nice sugar sweetness mixed in. I think I get more sour apple than peach myself but it does show up in the aftertaste. For a newbie I would compare it sour patch kids or those candy peach rings. The flavor hits immediately and stays the same throughout. It really holds up for the long run. I think I would enjoy it more if the carbonation was amped up a bit but still it feels pretty good on the tongue. My first sour, or at least I think it is, actually delivered on what I expected. It really tasted exactly as I imagined it would and that does not happen often with beer.","generalnotsew","Apr 22, 2011"

There's a little bit of fruitiness but it's almost stale and somewhat metallic. The flavors tell a whole different story, thankfully. Sweet, syrup-like peaches up front and some bitterness at the back. High carbonation with a thick mouth-coating consistency. This brew is good, but it's even better when you have someone to split it with. Too sweet for me to consider drinking an entire 750.

The smell is strong and fruity. It smelled of banana to me. The taste is very sweet with banana ester. It tastes like a cider to me, or fruit juice. The peach is especially noticeable in the afteretaste. This beer is thin like cider in your mouth, like slightly carbonated water.

The flavor is heavy on syrup and sugar with a bit of peach, like the stuff canned peaches sit in. This is way too sweet for me but I like peaches so I wanted to give it a fair shot. Lindemans needs to add some peaches to Cuvee Rene, that would be awesome.","ArrogantB","Jan 24, 2010"

Taste is sweet and full of peaches. A nice tartness balances it with a touch of soap and funk. Still a bit sweet overall. A good dry finish brings grains and a clean juiciness. Crisp feel with a light medium weight. A dry quenching sensation as I drink. Even though the abv is low you really need a food to enjoy going through a bottle of this as the taste makes this on a sipper more that a quaffer.","scootny","Jan 16, 2010"
3.7,-5.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"My wife's a big fan of this so I snagged a small glass out of her 750 for a review. The pour is golden orange with a bit of haze. Bright fluffy white head. Lots of sweet peach in the aroma. This is also echoed in the taste. There's a hint of sourness, but it is pretty tame. I've had this before and of the Lindemans, I've always preferred the apple. This lacks that punch of sourness that I enjoy. I'll stick to merely bummin' a sip of this every now and then.","alkemy","Jan 14, 2010"
3.7,-5.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a translucent golden orange color with a 1/2 white head that fell quickly leaving some sparse lacing in the tulip. Nice funk in the nose, much more so than their Kriek or Framboise, with a light peachy fruitiness. Not bad in the aroma department. Wow! I can't believe how much peach flavor this has, based on what was coming from the nose. Sweet orchard fruit, sugar syrup, light tartness and acidity, something that would have really made this beer sing if there had been a little more. Not bad at all, but maybe just a tad too sweet for my liking. Medium body with ample carbonation tingle. This is a tasty beer, but I'm pretty much done after one and couldn't see myself drinking more than one.","KeefD","Dec 31, 2009"

Sweetness is waaay too much and the mouth puckering sourness that I enjoy so much in lambics is toned down quite a bit. Carbonation is very high, almost to the point of champagne. The peach flavors are very prevalent, and I am guessing have some artificial boosting additive. It tastes pretty decent, but a bit too sweet and a tad too expensive for me to want to buy again.","twiggamortis420","Dec 08, 2009"

Taste is slightly tart peach, which the nose did not hint at. Faint hints of hay and must, minor candied sugar background (to offset tartness?). Thin body, crisp, carbonated slightly less than champagne, somewhat dry and little tart aftertaste.

Light orange to yellow in color, very clear but not close to watery, transparent though, close to hard cider in appearance. The nose very clearly expresses peach fruit, boisterously fresh, touch of lemon and orange citrus, golden honey glaze, lifts and spreads widely, not sure it's supposed to do more than this. Full-bodied, downy soft carbonation relieves heaviness yet sinks in all the way and requires effort to wash out of the palate. Huge, juicy peach with tang, the orange and lemon citrus a very able supplement, contributes to an uptempo pace and general mouthwatering quality. There's nothing here that isn't obvious from the start, however, no less impressive for it.","farrago","Nov 19, 2009"

A sweet candied peach aroma with hints of apple; jolly rancher like characteristics. Big sweet sugary flavors, definitely fruity. The peach does peak out after the initial sweet blast. There is also some white grape and apple skin flavor to add a slight tartness. Again, does remind me of a jolly rancher. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation.

The taste is also peachy, but there is a malt-grain background that reminds you that you aren't drinking a wine cooler. Not too sweet, the wild yeast has created a slight sour-tart note that complements the mix quite nicely.

Maybe a tad too sour and fruity for a sessioning, but I gladly look forward to having this again.","clayrock81","Aug 14, 2008"

Mouthfeel is very acidic, carbonated. This is a drinkable beer that has an ever-changing flavor thoughout the drink.

Taste was incredibly similar to apple juice...not too sweet, not too sour. Starts off very juicy, then ends off on a dry note. I would say mouthfeel was medium, in that it was sort of syrupy. Not bad on the drinkability scale, but one bottle of this was enough for me. I think next time I will stick with the kriek or the framboise, but still very interesting.

The smell was very nice and peach, but the taste was tart and hard to drink. I got a sick, quesy feeling after finishing off a bomber, not a good feeling either. My stomach was churning like hell as was my gag reflex...the mouthfeel is quite heavy however, I'm assuming because of the fruit additives, but because of its tartness and wear on my stomach, I don't think I'll be revisting the fruit lambics for awhile...I considered this more peach champange than beer, and I didnt even feel a buzz for what its worth","MusicmanSD","May 03, 2007"

The taste is definetly moire peachy and earthy with a very strong butterscotch and light cream backbone. very odd taste for a fruit lambic in my opinion. Not bad though.

A little funky barnyard aroma with some earthiness, ripe peach, and very mild pie spice. Pretty nice! Very sweet and syrupy, kind of cloying, with lots of peach flavour and mild tartness. That pretty much sums it up. Medium carbonation with a heftier body than expected, palate coating initially but slightly drier by the finish. Fairly creamy texture.

Quite similar to the Pomme, but with a richer fruit flavor and texture. Solidly cider-ey but with a serious beer undertone. Enjoyable, but only on occations.

This is a one note beer, as most of these fruity Lindeman beers are, but it really hits that note wonderfully.

It almost tastes like fresh picked whole peaches in here. There's a tart granny smith quality underneath which cuts the sweetness of the peach. Then there's a nice little acidic finish but the notes of peaches remains the whole time. Body seems fuller than any other Lindemans offerings and the carbonation is not overdone.

Taste was very sweet, but not syrupy or overly powering. Very peachy, with a sugar like after taste. Yet, I must say again, not overpowering. This is not a bad drink.

It has a pleasent aftertaste that lingers of peach and a resonating sweetness. As I work my way through this one the taste deadens the senses and eventually it becomes more and more palatable.

It's not really very beer-like- more cider/fruit juice (Hansen's) than beer. It's a nice change of pace to have, but I couldn't drink it often. Note: my girlfriend hates beer of all types, but she actually likes this stuff (and the Framboise too).","Dukeofearl","Feb 29, 2004"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured an apricot color that was hazy in appearance. Still visible were the carbonation bubbles, not much carbonation, but just enough. The head that was produced was white in color, not very dense, I would say that the bubbles were hollow in appearance; the foam did last for some time before it fell to almost nothing. There was lace present full in places and spotty in others. The aromas that came from the glass were all faint, not too overpowering, peaches, hops, and a sprite soda kind of aroma tickled my nostrils and finished with a light yeast hint. Kind of sour and kind of dry, just what I would expect from Lindemans and a lambic. The flavors that I tasted were peaches up front, in the middle and as the end, some sweet malts, wheat grains mixed in through out, hops, a light hint of alcohol, became present as it warmed, and it finished with that light yeasty wheat flavor. Tart aftertastes of peaches were present. The body was on the light/medium side. Over all this beer was a pleasure to drink, crisp, clean, tart in places, and over all nice and peachy. This is a fine dessert beer, and will keep a few on hand.","Jarod","Feb 07, 2004"

It seems a bit dry, but the majority is of sour peaches. The taste is good. It is rich and very tart. It has an intense sour peach flavor that is quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This drinks very well. I love lambic beers. Lindemans has the best that I've tried.","WesWes","Feb 04, 2004"

4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a cloudy light amber color and formed huge off white bubbly head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of peach, yeast and other lambic elements I have never been good at placing. A flavor of peach and some slight bread elements/yeast. The finish is sweet and a bit tart, which is pretty much what I expect from this style. While not my favorite style of Belgian, I have slowly been gaining an appreciation for them.

Sugary sweet that tastes much like a hard candy. Peach taste dominates here. Yeast aftertaste is strong causing a dry, chalk-like finish. Good mix of sweet and sour, but perhaps a little too sweet.","stoutman","Jan 06, 2004"

There were a bunch of girls there who just don't drink, haven't developed any taste for tannins or hops. Just a drop of this peach lambic and they all loved it. So, in summary, nice sweet fruity drink that may be especially appreciated by the uninitiated.

It was very clean smelling. The taste was also very clean with a mild peach taste and a slight sourness and acidic taste. A most enjoyable drink. Im not a big fan of the sweet drinks but this one isnt too sweet, and that makes it an agreeable dessert drink.","HochFliegen","Dec 27, 2003"

Had a smell spritzy white head woth a dirty yellow body full of carbonation. Smell was cool, with lots of bubblegum flavors and just a lingering hint of the peach. The taste was very refreshing with more peach, just a little of the musty funk of a lambic and a ton of sparkling champagne characteristics.There was also a good deal of dry tart body that helped make this very refreshing. The mouthfeel was very carbonated and usually I am not a fan of overcarbonation, but with a lambic it always seems to hit the sopt. Perfectly refreshing and always makes you question whether you are actually drinking a beer. Tasty even on a chillier night.","GreatPondBrewer","Nov 22, 2003"
4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Translucent amber-straw color with virtually no head but some active carbonation. Peach notes are light and fresh and very appealing. As with other Lindemans offerings, the fruit and grain smells complement each other and meld nicely--a distinct difference from the tacky fruit beers on the market. Taste is unexpectedly sweet at the start, but the subtle tartness leaves no doubt that you're tasting genuine peaches. Grains are muted until the end, and even then the maltiness is quite subtle. Mouthfeel is very pleasant despite the sweetness; it is more clean than syrupy. This is another fine Lindemans lambic, but one is enough at a sitting.","BitteBier","Nov 16, 2003"

The nose is fresh peaches and equally fresh wheat with kisses of yeast clean. Good potency. Inviting. The taste is much the same with peaches and fresh cut wheat nicely tart, not very sweet. Rather juicy, very little funkiness, oh well. Complex enough. It is amazingly appetizing, palate cleansing. Dry finish. Medium body. Light carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, very nice. This is damn good. There is always a time and a place to sip this one. The cost is prohibitive though. Try one.","bditty187","Oct 16, 2003"

The aroma of fresh peaches, sweet yet tart, with a hint of yeast, oh so inviting this nose, what a Hoot. Front is ambrosial with a tartness at the sides, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is piercing in its acidity with the peach flavor present till the very end, the aftertaste desert dry and semi-sweet.","Gusler","Oct 09, 2003"

3.7,-5.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This peach lambic poured a beautiful light golden color with a huge, frothy head. Trails of lace accumulated on the sides of the flute glass. Aroma was an almost one-dimensional onslaught of ripe peaches, with some acidic qualities thrown in for good measure. The first taste of this revealed the most sour taste, while subsequent sips provided a very fruity, sweet peach quality. Almost too sweet for my lambic interests, but a crowd pleaser nonetheless. Mouthfeel was prickly, clean and inviting. Due to the sweetness, it's not one that I can drink time and again, but it's a decent fruit lambic that most folks seem to enjoy. Note: This paired incredibly well with a peach and blueberry cobbler.","Jon","Aug 17, 2003"

One or two of these would be drinkable, although I think beyond that the sweetness would become too cloying.

It's a fairly clear golden color, and some wonderful lacing occurs all the way down the glass. The aroma is a sour peach, but it's not pungent. The mouthfeel is very smooth. This beer is wonderfully pleasantly sweet, sour, and peachy. It isn't puckering like other lindemans lambics, making it more drinkable and refreshing.

If you have tried the Kriek, Cassis or Framboise and didn't find these to your liking don't make a prejudicial opinion based on those.

4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy, brass tinged orange robe topped by a short creamy white head. The head drops shortly but keeps a creamy collar and whispy surface covering, as well as leaving some nice lace. The aroma combines a very nice, authentic fresh peach that's not overly sweet with minor flashes of lambic character (light lactic sourness, very mild mustiness). The body is light/medium with a very fine and restrained carbonation that gives it a creamy mouthfeel and adds to it's smooth fruitiness. The flavor is, again, quite realistically peachy with a ripe, juicy, sweet fruitiness that's backed by a tart edge. Some minimal lambic character becomes apparent in the long finish and adds to it's complexity. Of the Lindeman's fruit lambic line-up, this one seems a bit more delicate and a little less sweet, and therefore has more versatility. I works equally well as an appertif or dessert beer, and would be splendid at almost any time during the summer (think sunset on the beach)! And although I normally lament the lack of more aggressive lambic character (acidity, mustiness, barnyard) in the Lindeman's beers, I feel that actually works here. Quite refreshing and highly enjoyable. It's well worth seeking out and should not be passed over for the Kriek or Framboise.","NeroFiddled","Dec 11, 2002"

Also, some nature-like aromas, specifically something you'd find on a farm. I've heard this described as "horse blanket" character, that's exactly how I'd describe it as well. Very distinct character all around that is best described with the word "aged". Under all of this, hops and malt are still detectable in a slight bitterness and an earthy grain character. Overall, tart-sourness dominates. Probably the best of the Lindemans fruit lambics, but it would be much better if it wasn't sweetened. Go for a Cuvee Rene gueuze instead.","hyuga","Sep 30, 2002"
