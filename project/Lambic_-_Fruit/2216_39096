4.15,-8,4,4.5,4,4.25,4,"curious that people freak out for this and happily drop 50 bucks a bottle for it. its good, but its also weird and has some unpleasant features i thought, although it definitely improves a lot as it opens up and warms up over time. the color is murky pink, muted and old looking, still with a nice bit of off white head on top and plenty of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. the nose is amazing, a nice mix of wood and the two fruits, with a slight edge going to the cherry in my opinion. nice funk levels, lots of lacto, dry, enticing, unique. the flavor starts off fine, like any other fruited lambic really, but it goes weird about halfway through. at first i start tasting iodine and band-aids, but it does beyond that to a novocaine almost hospital medicinal plasticy thing that lasts forever on the palate. not sure if this is denaturing fruit or weird bottle conditioning yeasty notes or what, but its intense and its sharp and its not very appealing. this drops out a bit after it warms up and breathes, and i also am getting used to it as i drink this beer, but it never really goes away, and i think its a distraction from the intended flavors of this beer. mouthfeel aside from the numbing aspect is nice, with a dry feel and big boy carbonation. the fruit and funk are great, and acidity is only mid range for the style. i like it more and more as i drink it, but to call this one of the best lambics going is a huge stretch for me. i appreciate it but dont love it at all.","StonedTrippin","Dec 14, 2014"

Head remains at the surface and a thick collar. Fair legs, and poor lacing. Aroma is a ton of cherry and an odd funk. Smells almost like cherry cough medicine. Taste is lightly tart, rich raspberry more than cherry flavor, and an oakiness. Medium body and high carbonation, with a fruit-like stickiness to the mouthfeel. Great beer, but the slight cough syrup-like quality is off putting in the aroma and flavor.","mverity","Jul 01, 2014"

Just layers and layers of sensory satisfaction. The raspberry is dominant over the cherry,  but allows a (yet another) layer of flavorthat doedoesn't come from either fruit alone. Super funky with big raspberry tartness.  As it warms the tart mellows and the bottom of the bottle gets better and better. Just heaven.","NuclearRich","May 23, 2014"

The smell is incredible on this - pungent raspberry jam is dominant with a faint barrel funk. The taste is more sour and lactic with the fruit falling towards the end, but still quite prevalent after 4 years of sitting in the bottle. Tart lemons, balsamic vinegar, and fairly acidic but not overwhelming and quite balanced. A moderate level of carbonation keeps things lively on the acidic and keeps things refreshing. Overall one of the best sours that I've had - an almost perfect balance of fruit and sour and very glad that I was able to get a bottle - and given the scarcity, will likely be the last one I’ll come across.","JoeySchlitz","Dec 06, 2011"

Aroma is raspberries, sourness and slight mild acidic nose. But as I drank more bottles over time, it they became more and more medicinal phenolics and a touch of plastic notes (Band-aids). A little dry with a solid lactic tartness, woody raspberry pit note, and a medicinal / phenolic finish that doesn’t come on quite as strong as it did in the nose. Mouthfeel gets used to the acidity and funk as the raspberry notes pick up in intensity a bit. Still a kind of dry with a raspberry pulp flavor with touches of cherry skins to it. Carbonation is definitely on the light side! Hopefully the next batch will produce a much more fruity smell and taste and not the phenolic/band-aid aromas.","ygtbsm94","Nov 14, 2011"

Pours a cloudy golden pink. Aroma is a big and wonderful sour raspberry flavor - the sour cherries just seem to punch up the berry flavor - with some nice funk, mildly cheesy. Taste has a lot of sourness and is quite dry, at this point. Tons of berries and funk on the palate. Everything comes together well. Pretty good pucker - ~7/10. Otherwise, the mouthfeel is appropriate to the style, not too effervescent but fairly light. Tried at the same time as Malvasia and preferred that one but only by a small margin.

2.93,-35,4.5,1.5,3,4,3.5,"Shared by fellow lambic enthusiast Weisguy for our small sour tasting. 750ml Valentine’s Day 2007 bottling ♥ Hommage pours medium amber red and not too dark to see through. The smell is crazy! I get very rotten, sweet fruit--especially raspberry--along with funky puke, poop, rhubarb & cheese. The taste definitely connects to the smell, but is much less offensive to me with tons of funky raspberry & hearty fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is not very dry, but a bit sweet. Not very close to what I was expecting and in a negative way because it was hard to get passed the smell.

4.03,-10.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into my Russian River "tion" glass and this beer appears quite oily with a rather vibrant reddish brown appearance capped with just a slight bit of off-white head. Leaves some lace and looks very oily in the glass. I heard and read the descriptor "band-aid" used to when characterizing various funky beers, but up until this one I had never actually experienced in first hand. Smells exactly like a band-aid and this is quite musty and funky on the nose. Some aspects are appealing while other are a little off-putting. Getting some fruit in the form of raspberries that were perhaps sitting in someone basement wrapped in a ace bandage for a decade or two. The smell is unique enough and enticing enough to warrant a higher score than I might usually give for a bouquet as foul as this. Taste is certainly an improve as the band-aid has taken a backseat and the fruit, funk, tart, and sour qualities make a push to the forefront. Earthy raspberries are the focus and dare I say that the smell and the taste are worlds apart with the taste being highly superior. Very nice mouthfeel with spot-on carbonation. A nice lambic, but not necessarily earth-shattering in anyway.","Lunch","Apr 11, 2011"

There's a bit of bandaid lingering in the background of the nose, though this disappears in the flavor. Taste has a good amount of raspberry and damp earth. Light wood and a moderate amount of acidity. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a sour, dry finish. Not too much funk anywhere, more toward a light earthiness.

4.75,5.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"2007 bomber - thanks to Yves Panneels for helping me track this beer down. Shared with buds this weekend. Pours a cloudy, cherry red with a small foamy head. Great nose of tart fruit and raspberry. Nicely carbed. A little wood and mineral flavor adds to the sweetness.. Has an insane amount of berries floating on the palate, mixing with the funk to make this a fantastic fruit lambic for me. Yummy stuff!","Doodler","0"

Funky, a super fresh and most accurate raspberry taste, there is also a distinct aroma of strawberries. The funk is the perfect amount...Taste is great, funky, the exact amount of puckering tartness to make you happy but not so much you can't drink the whole bottle yourself. Light sweetness adds to a great drinkability.","jrallen34","Aug 23, 2010"
4.37,-3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"After having several of these I would conclude that this is a really impressive fruit lambic, one of the best I've had.

The flavor is a drying sour with cherry, raspberry, and bitter blood orange. There is also a bit of a sweet grenadine on the mid-palate. The carbonation is very much alive with a medium, almost tannic body. The finish is very long with cherry flavor. This is an amazing beer that I feel lucky to have tasted.

No lace, as to be expected. Smells like the Clone of Dr. Funkenstein! Musty wood, sweet raspberry, wet earth, and a touch of broccoli (???). Tastes of raspberry and wood with slight chocolate notes. It's sour sweet and tart all at the same time! There's little to no astringency, but a zing that you could associate with raspberry soda. Very balanced, the taste of the raspberry isn't masked by the sourness at all. What's wonderful about this is the fact that the fruit really shines here and the sour is almost secondary. This is the best lambic I think I've ever had!","radshoesbro","Dec 12, 2009"

The fruit component was fantastic. i didn't detect much funkiness and it was only slightly tart but overall I was very impressed. This is probably the best fruit lambic I have had if not a close second to Cantillon Fou Foune. Amazing beer.","ArrogantB","Sep 07, 2009"

3.96,-12.2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Beautiful clear ruby red color with a white head that sits atop it. Head falls gracefully until it just sticks around the glass. Aroma is largely of raspberries, but almost like a very light raspberry. I mean that in the sense that it isn't the over the top flavor and slight astringency one would get from actually eating a raspberry, it's more like a raspberry juice was used. There's also some definite cheesy notes in this that I find a bit distracting; various barnyard funk notes are also perceptible, but hidden beneath to me, which is unfortunate. Taste is another story, I actually enjoy it qutie a bit. Same thing again with the raspberry taste, there's no slightly astringent, kick-you-in-the-face raspberry flavor that I love, but it is enjoyable. Lactic tartness is one of the other things that comes right to the forefront, followed by some very pleasing funkiness. If this funkiness and/or the raspberries were a touch stronger, this beer would be much better, especially if some of the cheesy notes were no longer coming through in the nose. About medium carbonation with a decent body on the tongue, followed by a nice dry finish. A good beer that I'd surely have another of, however, price and availability do limit that.","badbeer","Aug 31, 2009"

Hazy pinkish-purple color, pours with almost no head, though there's plenty of carbonation for the style. The aroma is largely macerated raspberries, backed by a mild funk and an odd note of tomato juice. The raspberry aroma on this beer is phenomenal, I couldn't keep my nose out of the glass. The taste is similarly exceptional - raspberries are dominant, faintly sweet up front, sour in the finish. Sourness is moderate, while harsh acetic acids are minimal. Light in body, puckering and dry. Amazing stuff.","largadeer","Dec 04, 2008"

It seems to be missing that jam-like (sans sweetness of course) fruit intensity that I was expecting, though I like that this is quite dry and quaffable.
