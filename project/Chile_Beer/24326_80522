I'm surprised by the smoke/peat/rauchbier taste, but it works really well here; the fact that you can taste the jalapenos is perfect -- if this is a gimmick, at least you can taste the gimmick.  and for me it's NOT a gimmick ... this brew is just begging to be paired with some food, tacos or cheese or something.","Premo88","Dec 06, 2014"

Not too much body or other flavor but for those who like a spicy beer, this beer delivers. A true jalapeno beer that they really nailed in terms of delivering jalapeno.","Richardbeerlover","Apr 02, 2014"

3.99,22,3.75,4,4,4,4,"D - I thought this was great. It had the right level of spice, without going into gimmick territory; you can still taste the base beer and it integrates nicely with the peppery flavors. Would happily drink this again, although it'd be hard to have more than a bottle in an evening.","MasterSki","Jun 06, 2013"

3.68,12.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a large white head. The aroma is a mix of biscuit malt and fresh green jalapeno peppers. The flavor is more of the same and about what I expected. The biscuit malt is overpowered by the peppers, which are also accompanied by a little bit of grass. Unlike some other pepper beers, the chilis add more flavor than they do heat, which in this case is a good thing. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","0"
