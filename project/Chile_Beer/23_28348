Lots of bubbles from the carbonation. The aroma of various peppers (actually Anaheim, Fresno, Serrano, Jalapeno & Habenero peppers) hits your nose right up front with some grain. The taste at first starts out sweet then the heat of the peppers hits your tongue with some heat BUT doesn't last long after, then the taste of malt. Not overpowering at all. Stronger than "Dave's Chili Beer" with the single pepper at the bottom of the bottle. Overall, this is pretty good and is different.","BeerWithMike","Jan 07, 2014"

I love hot food and almost any type of chilie I have ever tasted, and of course I love beer so the two together is very tasty. For this particular beer however, I could go for more chilie flavor and heat, but the way it is works well too.","allforbetterbeer","Nov 21, 2011"

3.99,19.8,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is like a good (or at least better) version of Cave Creek Chili Beer. The brew is a pale straw-gold, translucent, and generally projects an Adjunct Lager look; aside from the pepper addition, it is like an AAL in all respects. The nose is quite akin to the spicy nacho cheese cup that you get with the chips at the movie theater; it is not bad, however, it is more like a guilty pleasure, or a harkening to days past. The flavor reiterates the theme with equal parts corn-chip and spicy serrano-jalapeno flavor. It is admittedly just a hair's breadth away from being a debacle, and yet it retains that hair's distance above. It is in that precise nailing of flavor that Billy's Chilies makes its mark; it is not just gimmicky, it is a paradigm of frill-added merchandise.","ktrillionaire","Jun 01, 2011"
4.47,34.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ah yes, a chili beer. I love unconventional ingredients in beers and nothing says unorthodox than five different hot pepper tastes crammed into one 12 ounce bottle! Pours a rich auburn color with a tight head. The smell is spicey with caspian and light pineness. Taste was what I hoped for. I could almost feel the flame roasted pepper skins on my tongue. Nice heat but not overpowering with some light hopping in the background. It was a little hard to distinguish the different peppers but I still loved it. Great beer Twisted Pine!","Portertime","May 16, 2011"
4,20.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall - I really enjoy this beer, not more than one and not every day, but every week or so with mexican or other spicy food, it's a nice change of pace, but if you don't like spicy food or hot peppers, than this isn't going to change your mind.","tripelhops","Apr 13, 2011"
3.93,18,2.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"As someone who loves spicy food, this is a true delight. Sure, the taste isn't that great and the beer itself feels a bit on the slimy side.

With the right meal this could be a fabulous beer. I would be happy to have a few in my fridge for mexican food night. Otherwise, its a bit intense on my stomach for my beer likes.

3.78,13.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Easy drinking - seems like the ABV is low. Can be a little bit filling. Flavors are certainly potent and dominating, but surprisingly the chilies don't create a residual hotness. Goes well with pizza.","katan","Aug 23, 2010"
3.42,2.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Generic mild "beer taste" (as the description on the bottle so accurately suggests) on the front end of the palate, quickly turning bold and spicy. I'm quite impressed by the sheer true spicy peppery character. A slight lingering burn reminds me of what I just drank. A pretty decent beer. Paired well with fajitas.","wnh","Jul 30, 2010"

3.84,15.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"The taste is spicy from start to finish, though it never overwhelmed me. I like the body of it, it's got a decent amount for what it is. I can't say it tastes "beery" as the the label suggests, but I don't need it to. I'm not rushing to the fridge for another, but I finished this one rather quickly. You probably want to be acclamated to spice before diving in nose and tongue first. Yum.","brownbeer","Jul 26, 2010"
3.79,13.8,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The flavor starts out sweet with some pale malts and light hoppiness. The peppers taste crisp and initially fresh, as in the aroma, and remind me of biting into a cold pepper seed. The finish is where this beer shines, as the heat kicks in with a spicy warmth that reminds me of a good, fresh salsa. Mouthfeel is crisp and light in both body and carbonation, which allows the delicateness of the peppers to do their thang. All in all, a very well-done Chile beer from an otherwise unimpressive Twisted Pine BrewCo.","wagenvolks","Jul 26, 2010"

3.12,-6.3,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/6 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong chili, but not fresh chili, and yeast. Fits the style of a Chile Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong chili, slight yeast, and slight pale malt. The chili does not seem to be fresh, and is so strong as to throw off any hope of a good blend.","Tone","Apr 24, 2010"
3.9,17.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer poured a golden color with a small white head that quickly dissipated into a small white film on top of the beer. The aroma was of jalapenos. The flavor was also of jalapenos with just a little bit of heat with it. I didnt think it was that hot, but I have a pretty high tolerance for hot and spicy food or drink. I liked it, but definitely not a beer for everybody. Probably would not drink more than 2 consecutive.","biggmike","Mar 28, 2010"
3.18,-4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This is like a typical but spicy lager, but the spicy flavors add enough to pull it above a typical beer and make it interesting. If you like spicy things, give this a go with out question. I am in no way a parishioner of spicy anything, but I find this to be a welcomed oddity to my usually fair. May not be heaven, may lean toward hell in essence, but its worth a try no matter where your faith lies.","EgadBananas","Mar 25, 2010"
3.47,4.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As expected, a chile taste. Green serrano pepper taste with some green vine. Some flower enters just as the end comes in with a good chile spice. On the hot side as it finishes, but tame.","Mebuzzard","Jan 13, 2010"
3.52,5.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Let me preface this by saying I am a pretty big fan of chile beers, I have even brewed them a time or two myself. This one has got quite a bit of heat, not surprised if they did indeed use any amount of habanero and/or serrano. There is some mild, sweet grainy malts up front coupled with a nice earthy pepper flavor. The finish does have a little bitterness to it, but quickly followed up by some heat...and not just a bit. The heat really does not stay in the mouth, but rather migrates to the back of the throat and lingers there for quite some time. I like it, and feel it ranks above average for the style. Might be a tad too hot though, as just as much pepper flavor can be achieved without the fire.","twiggamortis420","Oct 30, 2009"
1.68,-49.5,3,2.5,1.5,1,1,"In almost every aspect - smell, taste, mouthfeel - this is merely an underhopped clone of bud light, but one that has been doused in fiery vegetable flavors that completely destroy any reminants of a drinkable beer.","SPThirtyThree","Oct 18, 2009"
