3.72,-3.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"The brew pours dark brown in color with a khaki colored head that holds well. As it fades, it leaves spotty lace on the glass. The aroma for the most part contains primarily pepper spice that tingles the nose with a fair amount of cocoa in the background. The taste is fruity somewhat yeast driven with plenty of cocoa and peppery citrus burn. This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Overall I think the base beer is lacking quite a bit as it is thin and lifeless but the cocoa and oeoper addition was well executed and made for a good "save" of the beer.","stakem","Sep 02, 2014"

3.79,-1.8,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"i respect it, but i don't really love it, thats my take on this smoked chili porter. all kinds of woods used here for the malt, and the pepper is intense on it, so for the lover of a little heat in their brew, this is for you. chocolate brown in color with an oatmeal looking head over an inch tall. it smells heavily smoked, with the pepper coming second. a little watery perhaps on the body, but it doesnt hurt it much in my eyes. i get a lot more pepper heat than i need here, its not dominant, but its real strong, and has the curious property of mellowing out with temperature, opposite of what i have known to be the standard. the smoke is the best part, its complex and heavy, rachbier style, woody and earthy and a little bitter. if i was in charge of this beer, i would increase the grain bill, a little darker and bitter malt, and id scale back the pepper just a touch, but the alcohol is well hidden and i would like this a lot better if i could handle the heat, but I've never cared for much of that in my beer. impressive offering though, indeed has been doing some very unique stuff.","StonedTrippin","Mar 29, 2014"

5,29.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Everything about this beer is perfect, it's an excellent example of every style of beer that makes it up, porter, smoke beer, pepper beer all balanced perfectly together, and this year I don't even have to go down to indeed to get one! This is in my opinion an amazing example of how complex a beer can be but still beautifully simple if that makes any sense. This is just such a balanced beer and perfect to pair with food and friends in the ridiculously long frigidly freezing winter we've had here. None of the flavors overwhelm the palate or over take the others. So pleasant, not too much smoke or heat, I'd say the smoke a high low and the heat is moderate but you still have a great porter as a base, I think indeed should start canning the porter without the smoke and peppers as a year round beer, that would be glorious! one of my favorite beers that I tried and forgot to rate of last year and it's just as good if not better this year, yum!","Beerlover","Beers"
