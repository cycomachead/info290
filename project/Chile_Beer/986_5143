Anyway, this is an easy drinking ale with a healthy hit of chili flavor and not much more. If you are looking for complexity or intensity, look elsewhere.","spoony","Feb 18, 2015"

3.7,7.2,,,,,,"You really have to be prepared for this one.  It's pretty spicy, and as such, it goes great with Mexican food.  But it's really a sipper, and it's tough for me to put down a whole pint just because of the strong pepper flavor.  People either love this beer or hate it as a result.  Since I'm not a big hot and spicy guy, I'd pass on ordering it straight up, but it's actually great in a sampler.","dcscientist","Sep 26, 2014"

3.87,12.2,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"one of the few chili beers i really actually like to drink a pint of from time to time. pours a pale ale looking straw color with an average white head. smells like a ton of roasted chilies, like the farmers market in late summer. smokey and spicey. flavor has no heat at all though, just the essence of anaheim and serrano peppers. there is a good light malty body to support all the pepper flavor, and a complimentary late hop burst that kind of cools the thing off a bit. goes great with the calamari at wynkoop, and will definitely surprise you if you think chili beers arent your thing. this one is famous for a reason.","StonedTrippin","Apr 10, 2012"

3.23,-6.4,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Overall: interesting how many of their beers look alike. This one is a little over powering with the chili, not too many other flavors outside of chili pepper.","kylehay2004","Sep 28, 2011"
4.08,18.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a clear brassy color with a small white head. Smell was not too strong, but had faint aromas of grains and chili peppers. Taste... This...beer...tasted...like....TACOS. I expected a little bit of a spicy twinge like with most other chili beers I've had, but this wasn't really spicy at all. Just TASTED LIKE TACOS. Really amazing actually. An easy, pale malt base, but when settled on the palate, I could taste the corn of the tortillas, vegetables, and chili peppers, sans the burn. I don't mind the burn, but this was definitely a nice change of pace. Light-medium body and very smooth, this was an extremely drinkable beer, and went great with the food.","Rifugium","Aug 16, 2011"

4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability is good, very unusual. If you like the taste of green chili's, you'll like it, but don't come for strong smoke or heat. Very unique for the style.","ccrida","Nov 10, 2009"
3.83,11,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: A very good pepper beer that is probably in my top five for the style. the bite is good and is not overpowering. The beer taste is there. I have sessioned this before at the bar.","tigg924","Nov 01, 2009"
4.12,19.4,3,3.5,5,3,4,"This my first beer from the Wynkoop Brewery, had a very nice chili taste to it. To me it was like have the best Nachos and cheese with all the fixins you love in a bottle, also wood make a great contribution to Nacho's and Cheese. Not to spicy has I've had from other chile beers but very balanced taste.","RomulanAle","Dec 06, 2008"
3.7,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Interestingly enough, this may have been my favorite sampling at the brewery during my GABF '08 visit. The beer begins with a fairly average Blonde Ale base that shows soft pilsner maltiness / sweetness, and a mild ester profile. The peppers are the mild Aneheim ones that deliver a crisp vegitable-chile taste that blends well with the grains. The heat is mild, giving balance to the malts in the absence of noticible hops. Light in the body, which makes the beer very drinkable. Finishes with a chili taste and moderate warming. Quite nice.","BEERchitect","Oct 17, 2008"
3.95,14.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a nice golden color with great head and some nice lacing, as well as a nice amount of carbonation, nearly lager like in its appearance. Nice sweet beer, good balance between malt and hop, with a great chile flavor, enough to enjoy but not so much it takes away from everything else. It goes down nice, if just a bit too much carbonation.","JamesS","Aug 04, 2008"
1.99,-42.3,3.5,2,1.5,3,2,"I had this one a couple of weeks ago on my birthday at Wynkoop. While I'm not adverse to trying something new, this one threw me off. The chile flavor is a bit too overpowering for me, and it doesn't balance well with the beer. I can appreciate how some would like it, and I honestly didn't find it vile. However, I would not order this one ever again.. it was just too overpowering in a bad way to me.","sevopie","Jun 21, 2008"
3.82,10.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor: dominated by the anaheim chile taste. A bit sweet in the middle, finish hot a nice chile burn to it. Great with a burger, I thought. One is enough for me, though.","Mebuzzard","Dec 17, 2007"
3.95,14.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer is not bad and I could have a few of these. I love chili beers. There is not a lot going on here, but it is pretty drinkable.","jasonjlewis","Oct 14, 2007"
3.13,-9.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Ordered on tap at the Wynkoop Brewery in Denver. Usually I'm not a fan of chili beers, although this one worked for me. Poured a pale yellow with a greenish tint. Slightly cloudy. Very small bubbles of carbonation. White head. As expected, the smell and taste of green chilis dominated. Hard to taste the malt or hops in it. The chilis lingered a bit, although they weren't overly hot - they didn't affect the mouthfeel at all. Although the strong chili flavor made for tough drinkability. Their take on the style seemed good, although I personally don't reach for chili beers.","ndekke39","Jul 06, 2006"
3.76,9,3,4.5,3.5,3,4,"If you live in the area or stop into the Wynkoop while in Denver, this beer is a must-try just for it's uniqueness.","Domingo","Apr 27, 2005"
3.9,13,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This chile beer poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass somewhat. The smell was a sharp, green chile-like aroma backed by some maltiness. The taste was dominated by green chiles, though not overly hot/spicy, but more of a woody or earthy flavor. There was a good bready maltiness in the background and a very mild sweetness, and very modest hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and peppery with medium body and moderate carbonation. The malt and chile flavor lingered. This was a good example of this style. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I would drink more than one in a row.","UncleJimbo","Oct 11, 2004"
2.2,-36.2,2,4.5,1.5,2,1,"Aside from the lack of chili-power, the beer had little other flavor, it did have a noticeable malt-nuttiness, but hops were mild and it was a really light beer. Don't bother daring anyone to try this unless they're intimidated by extra mild salsa.","Reneejane","Jan 18, 2004"
