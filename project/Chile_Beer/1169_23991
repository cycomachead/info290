2.95,-19.2,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Reddish gold appearance, still no head. It smells of burn and strong pepper, maybe some banana pepper. Pepper. Start with a pepper taste then just a big burn of my throat overwhelming everything. I personally can not handle this one at all to even try and find taste other then pain and pepper. If you love peppers which many do this beer is for you. But I just can't do this one.","beckje01","Dec 21, 2006"

4.2,15.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Verdict: I love spicy food, so I actually enjoyed this beer a lot. Thier e-mail anouncing its release called this their most drinkable version of Wildfire to date, and I would have to agree with that, but it's still not for those who can't handle the heat. There wasn't excessive face sweating like the ale version. If I could I think I would have one of these every night I went out, good stuff.","dfried","Beers"
