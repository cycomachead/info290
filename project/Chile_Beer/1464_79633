I understand trying this for a novelty, but other than that, avoid this at all costs. Your intestines will never forgive you otherwise.","PSU_Mike","Sep 07, 2014"

It may just end up in the chili I am making. This is a bottle to share and punish your friends. It is not as hot as last year's version. It was made with pepper purée. This batch was just steeped with peppers, so I was told. I like spicy food, but I think I am done with this beer.","buschbeer","Nov 10, 2012"

I can't recommend this to anyone seriously, but if you know someone who can't get enough heat this may be right up their alley. This was the hottest thing I have ever consumed - food or drink.","TheBeerologist","0"

1.61,-37.8,3.5,2.5,1,2,1,"Ghost Scorpion is brewed with supposedly the two hottest chiles in the world (Ghost and Scorpion). From where I’m sitting, I’ll buy that. It makes for awful beer, but it’s damn hot! I guess if that’s your thing, knock yourself out. I’d suggest steering clear of this one though. Seriously….heed those words!","prototypic","Jun 04, 2012"

The heat on the mouth and throat was good, mostly tolerable, but once in the stomach my body seems to be rejecting my stomach. It's not like I want to throw up, more like my body wants to shovel my entire stomach out of itself. Am I going to die!!!","jlindros","May 04, 2012"

If you're looking for the hottest beer in the world this is probably it. It's definitely an interesting experience and, for what it is, it's great. High marks for this one, because seriously, if you're drinking this, you know what you're getting into, don't act all surprised when it burns the hell out of you.","WillCarrera","May 01, 2012"

4.15,60.2,3.5,3.5,5,3,4,"I bought 2 bottles and opened one to drink. This is not a beer, this is an event. The hottest thing in the world. I agree with the numbing effect on the lips. Two sips in, I had to do a shot of milk to get to the third sip. Poured the rest down the drain and two days later made chili with the second bottle. 2 quarts of chili with one bottle of this beer and my coworkers thought I was Texas Red. This beer is a pretty good idea, but a better ingredient. Maybe even better as a party toughman contest...need another bottle.","markwillus","Mar 21, 2012"
