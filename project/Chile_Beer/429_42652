3.99,5.8,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,"Pours with a proper tan head. Color is amber with hues or orange at the edges. Aroma consists of subdued citrus hops and surprisingly aromatic jalapeno notes. The jalapeno seems to overpower on the tongue a bit at first but some citrusy hops and sweet malt ride in to save the day. Medium bodied and mostly smooth. I must admit for reasons of transparency, that I'm not a big fan of jalapenos, but wanted to give this one a go to see how it worked. Despite my aversion to aforementioned pepper, I thought the beer was well-crafted and well balanced with no signs of contrivance.","stephens101","May 31, 2014"

3.71,-1.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium bronze amber with a fine, one finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Mild aroma of neutral malt, light grassy hops and a hint of hot pepper that is more soapy than tingling. Flavor of bready malt, light citrus, light stone fruit with building hop bitterness and hot pepper, finishes with a lingering mild, but distinctive jalapeno pepper flavor and light burn. Medium bodied. A mild mannered chile beer with a malt body that is closest to an amber, with interesting, but not distinctive chile pepper esters and a mild hotness. Surprising lack of hop flavor, although there is a moderate hop bitterness in the finish. Kind of misses the mark for an imperial IPA, but satisfactory for a light chile beer. Pleasant, but not memorable.","LiquidAmber","Beers"

Well made, I suppose, but it just doesn't have a whole lot going on in the hop department, and they are calling this an Imperial IPA. I don't expect to drop bomber price cash on this again. I don't even know that I would recommend trying it once. I have to, it's my closest regional brewery. I had heard it was "pretty good", but I would say "it's okay." Maybe a little better than okay, but not worth $9 a bomber with so many better DIPAs on the shelves.","sprucetip","Mar 31, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and jalapeno aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and jalapeno flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a jalapeno presence that adds aroma and flavor without any discernible heat.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 27, 2014"

3.94,4.5,4,3.75,4,4,4,"I was apprehensive buying this because I haven;t had much luck with Alaskan bombers but the thought of jalapeno and IPA was just so tempting. I'm actually glad I bought this even though it will be a one and done purchase. Color was orange, great head. Aroma was jalapeno pepper, strong jalapeno pepper. Flavor was pretty much the essence of a jalapeno pepper with a bit of bubblegum and citrus from the IPA trying to peek through. This also had no heat to it at all that I could detect. Overall a very interesting take and a worthwhile purchase.","ArrogantB","Mar 24, 2014"
3.21,-14.9,3,3.25,3.25,3.5,3,"Served in a standard pint glass, the pour produced a decent head but didn't last particularly long. A light copperish color that didn't impress, but wasn't defective. The smell is what you would expect. A pepper nose mixed with citrus and a bit of grass? The taste was solid. I'm not a big chile beer guy, but the mix of hops and pepper was somewhat interesting. Felt pretty good in the mouth with good body and a lively finish. Overall is was a solid beer. Not extremely interesting aside from the pepper notes that you would expect. Definitely better than something like cave creek.","Apolloliquor","Mar 24, 2014"

3.73,-1.1,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"A very respectable IPA but lacks the depth of a DIPA and/or a chili beer. Among other things, the smell is excellent for an IPA, I just expected to get some sort of chili scent and the chili flavor is extremely subdued. So, for a beer advertising itself as a jalapeno featured chili beer, this falls way short. As a standard IPA, this thing is pretty damn good. As a DIPA, it lacks some of the extreme punch one might expect. But you can't get around how generally tasty and flavorful this brew is, so that's why I gave it some relatively high ratings in some areas. Worth checking out and making your own opinions.","beergoot","Mar 18, 2014"

It's a nice balance of gentle jalepeno juice with nice lingering hops. Unique and mildly spicy. Solid mouthfeel and drinkability. Probably the most creative beer Alaskan makes.","shivtim","May 13, 2008"
3.38,-10.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sample in the Alaskan tap room. The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly. Stringy lacing. Aroma of hops and fresh peppers. Medium-bodied with a solid hops foundation and the jalapeno pepper flavor more subtle than expected. Touches of sweet malt here and there as well. The finish is bitter with a slight pepper aftertaste. I am honestly a little gunshy with chili beers (as anyone who has ever tried Cave Creek will attest). Still, while I appreciate the experimentation that goes into a beer like this, it is not something I would go out of my way to try again.","Dogbrick","Beers"

The previous pepper beers I had tried were among the worst tasting beers ever made. I like what Alaskan Brewing did with this one. It's great, drink it if you happen to find yourself in Alaska. It's a bronze medal winner, and from what I hear pretty hard to find.","tpd975","0"
