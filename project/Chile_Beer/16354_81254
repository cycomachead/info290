I love how it sneaks up on you with the peppers not really being evident in the aroma. It’s definitely a beast of a chile beer – a must-try if you’re a fan of this style.","BlackBelt5112203","Mar 23, 2013"

In reading the other reviews on BA, which are all from the old batch, Im inclined to think they've made some significant changes because the pepper notes are huge in this one! If spicy isnt your thing stay away. But if you love hot peppers then this beer is for you!","zac16125","Aug 09, 2012"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a touch over medium-bodied and good carbonation. Overall a really enjoyable beer, I'd be curious to try it with more peppers (speaking to Jamie at COAST, she informed me that Dave and Mikey want to do a version with a TON more chilies...here's hoping).","jsanford","May 31, 2012"

4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a dark red-orange with a half finger off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, subtle citrus, subtle smoke, and peppers. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, toasted malt, citrus hop, subtle dark chocolate, subtle smokiness, and jalapeño sweetness/spiciness . It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The citrus aspect I picked up on this one was really quite nice and a pleasant surprise. It really mixed well with the rest of the notes in the flavor and aroma. There was a nice backbone for the style present and the peppers were definitely out in force as they brought a nice spicy followthrough. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","0"
