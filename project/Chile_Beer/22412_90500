3.51,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and lots of chile aromas. Taste is much the same with a earthy chile flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of chile heat that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a mild chile presence that is definitely interesting.","UCLABrewN84","0"
