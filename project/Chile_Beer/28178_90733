3.89,0.5,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a jet black with brown head and quick dissapating head. Smell has a campfire smoke with hints of chipotle. Taste is a dark mole sauce, with dark chocolate, light smoked chipotle, roasty malt, with a lingering (but not overwhelming) heat that lingers to the palate. Like most smoke beers, it's  best to pair with food. I paired this with carnitas and it worked perfectly. A solid brew","RyBrew54","Feb 23, 2015"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Lots of heat on the back end with this beer. If you age it, heat subsides (from experience). Good offering from Pipeworks (as usual). Not for everyone. If you are sensitive to peppers, don't bother, otherwise, dig in.","Kevinpitts","Jan 19, 2014"

3.93,1.6,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"O: A friend warned me about the heat that this beer brings, but I got next to nothing in terms of fiery chile out of it, though in my experience, I feel these chile beers tend to have a lot of bottle variation. None-the-less, a good beer, just not the one I was expecting.","Florida9","Mar 25, 2013"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Solid stuff - like this just as much as their standard smoked porter, although I could have gone for even more chiles and burn. I'm probably in the minority in wanting hotter beers, but the label promised 'hot' and I was a bit letdown.","MasterSki","Mar 20, 2013"
3.98,2.8,3.75,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Overall: Really highlights the chipotle pepper, and does it very well without being overwhelming. With a little bitofadditional chocolate flavor, this could be really spectacular.","emyers","Mar 18, 2013"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Everything is really understated which is nice because a lot of smoked beers are completely over the top. I could have used a little more chipotle pepper in the flavor, but overall this was a nice addition to the Smoked Porter lineup.","Treebs","Mar 07, 2013"

4.16,7.5,3.75,4.5,4,4,4.25,"I'm still steamed at my local Chipotle for not honoring my quesarito order... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises cherrywood smoke, chipotle peppers (the peppers' smoke is distinct from the surrounding cherry), mild molasses, and a touch of cocoa powder. Everything blends together so well, and the smoke is so easy-going and pleasant, that I honestly don't wanna stop sniffing. The taste brings in more of the same, with a lighter smoke contingent, some cinnamon, some extra cocoa, and a hint of hickory wood. The peppers come through with a hint of spiciness close to the finish, but they don't linger very long. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a damn tasty smoked porter, one that doesn't over- or underdo it when it comes to both the smoke and the peppers (though the peppers come awfully close to underdone). Get some.","TMoney2591","Mar 04, 2013"

4,3.4,3.5,4,4,4.25,4,"Pleasant smooth feel with lower carb levels, earthy smoky chipotles linger into the dry aftertaste. Plenty of chile flavor without much heat really. End of Days is spicier. Some dry bakers chocolate notes come out mid-palate, and a slight tingle from the peppers as well. Overall a great variation on the standard Smoked Porter. Don't be scared off by the warning on the label that it's spicy...","emerge077","0"
