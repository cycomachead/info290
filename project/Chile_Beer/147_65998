3.81,35.1,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A excellent beer with a great showcase of peppers. Aroma fresh chili peppers hard to single out any in particular. Taste upfront is wave of chili; garden green jalapeno, and smoke leading to caramel / butterscotch middle and fiery finish. Very intriguing at first; somewhat one-sided and painful as the capsaicin burns its path initially. Through out sipping malt sweetness and caramel becomes more prevalent and burning dulls to where becomes more complex and bourbon shines thru. Personally set out to only have a glass; then wife waived the white flag after first sip and was stuck finishing the bottle which towards the end felt like punishment with senses saying "NO more PEPPERS!". A great experience but bring friends to help endure the ride to really appreciate this beer and "Stone" approach of a chili brew!","Jriggz","Jan 05, 2014"

Then, once you uncork it, this overwhelming, amazing chili pepper smell comes creeping out of the bottle letting you know what you're getting yourself into. Your pour it out, and you can see little chili pepper residue in the brew, and the smell really intensifies. The moment you drink it, those peppers just kick your ass, but in a really delicious way! I recommend the sip, not the gulp! Overall, I can't understand how someone who would spend the money to buy this would rank it low! You're upset a spicy beer is spicy?! Deal with it!

This beer has a low level of carbonation an almost flat mouthfeel.
