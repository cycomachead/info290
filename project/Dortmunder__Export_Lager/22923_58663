4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Extremely well balanced, perhaps the best lager out of Canada to meet our lips to date. The drinkability scale is showing off the charts. Pit this up blindly against a fine German lager, and we'd have a tough time picking which one is from Canada.","BeerAdvocate","Jun 29, 2013"
4.18,17.4,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Lager's personally aren't my favorite style, but it's hard to be a pint of Yellowhead premium lager on the rare occasion Edmonton has a hot day. For the best quality, stop by the brewery downtown and fill up a growler; it's cheap, environmentally friendly, and you get the freshest possible product.","david_wolf","Jun 17, 2013"

3.9,9.6,4,4,4,3,4,"Overall, this is WAY better than I remember. I might have to make this a regular part of my beer fridge! My first bottle must have been bad. Or perhaps they hadn't figured things out when the brewery was just getting started. Glad that there's another quality beer in E-town.","evlu1441","Nov 14, 2011"
3.26,-8.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Not a bad beer, a little fuller and sweeter than I prefer for a session lager.","elricorico","Jan 23, 2011"
3,-15.7,3,3,3,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a relatively large white foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet malt with clean cereal notes is refreshing. Taste is also dominated by clean cereal taste with lightly sweet ending. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Not bad but lacking fresher cereal notes and maybe some light crisp hops.","Phyl21ca","Aug 19, 2010"

3.86,8.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"It's an interesting beer - definitely not boring, in a style of beer that are usually quite boring. I think I like it.","prosper","Jul 06, 2010"
3.23,-9.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured into a glass mug. Three finger fluffy off white head on a deep golden yellow. Good head retention. Some moderate lacing. Malty smell. Caramel in the taste. Sweetish. Light hop finish. A bit weak. Medium body. Not bad drinkability. No real flaws but the sweetness would get a bit cloying after a while.","scott451","Jun 30, 2010"
3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A mild, but well-balanced and flavourful German-style bright lager. I'm looking forward to trying it on tap this summer.","biboergosum","Jun 02, 2010"
