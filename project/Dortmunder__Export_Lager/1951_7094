That said, it's a somewhat bland but serviceable beer; it's not really crisp enough to be a Pilsner nor rich enough to be a Dortmunder, but it's refreshing enough for me.","flagmantho","Beers"

Still not one of the better beers out there, it serves it's purpose and if I had to drink this one again, I wouldn't complain...I probably woundn't seek this one out again though, unless on vacation in the Honduras!

It smells of grassy, lemon hops and adjuncts. The taste is mostly bready malt with some lemon and hay. There some musty flavors and it's pretty macro-ish. It feels pretty light with some stinging carbonation and the finish is very dry. This beer is ok at best.","JMad","Jan 13, 2011"

2.94,4.6,4,2.5,3,3,3,"I'd call this a completely decent beach beer. There was a fair share of DMS and the aroma reminds me of corn casserole. The flavor is a basic, but fairly clean, crisp bready malt character that drops the mild spiced corn aroma. Yes, the label says "Export" but this just tastes like your basic pale Euro lager with a hint of fruit that most American lagers lack.","tempest","0"

Cereal grains are very sweet and not balanced at all by even a mere hint of hops. Mouthfeel approaches cloying, just too sweet.

Flavor is exactly like aroma. Body is like and in context with the above characteristics - in other words, not that great. Finish is like flavor and can serve the purpose of the moment, but in the longer term, best forgotten. Except to remind yourself to try and get something better.","drpimento","May 03, 2010"
3.28,16.7,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"My dad (a German Brewmeister) came up with this beer and even though it is not a A Class beer, it is smooth and a bit stronger hopsy malt flavour compared to other Honduran and Central American beers out there.

2.68,-4.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Finally, an import from Central America that isn't an American Adjunct Lager. ...At least not officially. This thing pours like a lighter version of the store-brand vegetable oil in my kitchen. Come on, Honduras, don't do this to me, the ol' Bait 'n' Switch. Dirty pool, Honduras. The nose better eat its spinach, 'cause it's pretty damn weak right now: only some vague corn syrup and rice notes waft through the thick haze that is the air. The taste comes pretty close to approximating this, but with less sweetness than would normally be expected. The rice fights its way through from the back of the bus. Damn bullies... Once again, I would recommend this brew eat its spinach, or anything for that matter, as the body is so very thin, finishing with an unsurprisingly dry effect. Honestly, I'm not sure how they get away with calling this thing a 'Munder. For that style, this is piss-poor. As an AAL, though, it's par for the course--though anybody can shoot par at that crappy old putt-putt down the road. You know the one.","TMoney2591","Nov 19, 2009"
2.06,-26.7,3,2,2,2,2,"The beer pours macro yellow with a white head. The aroma is corny macro. The flavor is more of the same with corn, rice and some malt sweetness. Just your basic adjunct flavor here. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Sep 12, 2009"
3.18,13.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Bone white head of noticeably delicate foam, dimples like it was bubble bath bubbles, crests at close to fingers than dissolves down, thin but persistent streaks of lacing. Pale yellow straw color, clear, not sufficient hue depth to notice much change at the rims, haphazard large bubbles launch upwards with good speed. The nose is simple but clean, sweet cornmeal and cereals, more honey than sugar, apricot pits, white grapes, no bitter residue, marked more by the absence of negatives than presence of positives. In the mouth it's light-bodied and almost evanescent, the carbonated swirl enhances palate presence. Same general appeal as in the nose, grains, cornbread, molasses, light white fruit, creamy enough with a hint of malts, just not a lot of length. Easy to drink and doesn't piss you off, two fairly big compliments for beers of this sort.","farrago","Sep 10, 2009"
2.69,-4.3,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"12oz bottle. Pours clear yellow/green with a surprisingly ample, fizzy white head. Smells of typical macro lager adjuncts, though with a slightly malty kick to it that makes it a bit more pleasant on the nose. Very similar taste--like any other nasty adjunct lager, but somewhat more substantial. Light body. As bad as this is, it's quantifiably better than BMC stuff, at the least.","philipquarles","Aug 31, 2009"

He planned to brew beer for the island, and I believe tried to, but was quickly run out of the business by the big wigs. I guess they went to all the businesses on the island and paid them NOT to sell his beer and continue to sell these 4 as the only local beers on the island.

3.34,18.9,2,3,4,3,3,"When out snorkeling or scuba diving, you'll want to stock your boat with Port Royal for the return trip. This beer blends well with the salty brine that has infiltrated your mouth and sinuses. The salt brings forth the crisp yet nutty characteristics that may be lost on an un-marinated tongue.
