3.78,4.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"the thing that really surprised me about this one was the mouthfeel. its another pils sure, a sacrificial offering from every brewery that needs to have a mass appeal beer, or at least one within basic style conventions. this is better than that though, creamy and dry at the same time, and well hoppy for what it is, not neatly american or german or czech, but rather a stylistic cuvee of all three, which might be yet to be done until this beer. i get grassy saaz type hop notes, but also german pils malt and a real basic and clean american lager yeast. its familiar but about as challenging as the style can be. highly carbonated and real refreshing, but something different. i always expect the world from three floyds, given the hype and the rarity, and while this falls short of i think the expectations i had, i still think its a heck of a pils, and one that should be treated as a one of a kind. well made and not deviating real far from what these guys do well.","StonedTrippin","Dec 06, 2014"

The head is short (especially for a 3 Floyds beer). The nose consists of bread, grain, and a touch of fruit, and there's a bit of skunk in there too. The taste begins rather sweet with pronounced grain but finishes heavy on the bread/biscuit flavors. This beer is quite crisp and easy to drink. As I haven't had more than a couple Dortmunder beers, I can't say whether this is really remarkable, but it is refreshing. While I tried it solely because it's a 3 Floyds beer, it's not one that I would seek out again, probably just because I'm not that interested in the style.","DeFaz","Jul 26, 2014"

Aroma of hay, sweet malt and honey, maybe some light fruits like apples and pears. Flavor is light straw, a little dirty lager flavor, them a nice burst of sweet fruit and honey-like malts. The flavor is very light and a sweetness remains on the palate. Light bodied, medium carbonation. Nothing super exciting but a solid pilsener overall that is pretty drinkable. This improves as it warms a little and some papaya and passion fruit comes out that is nice.","BMMillsy","Dec 18, 2013"

Orange and grapefruit are at the forefront, but again the bready malt comes thru and transforms this into more of lager. It finishes rather dry and bitter and the bitterness hangs on for awhile. This is a session beer if I've ever seen one. Small ABV, light mouthfeel, and very nice thirst quenching ability. This beer doesn't really fit the style it's suppose to fit into, but I think its a great beer by itself. Price could use a little work, being that it doesn't have the same heft that their other $10.99 6packs have. This was much better than I expected.","screamking","Oct 16, 2013"

3.53,-2.8,3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a nice, golden yellow with orang highlights. It pours with a little head of tight, eggshell white bubbles that, unfortunately, fizzle away quickly… I’m not sure if it’s my glass or the beer. The beer’s body is clean but a little hazy, it muddles sights on the other side of the glass. On the nose, this beer expresses its Noble hops as soon as the cap pops, with big herbal spiciness. As I put my nose in it, the beer smells clean, crisp, and a little like apple skins, which is scent I get a lot in pilsners. The malts are nice and crackery, giving light sweetness to the scent while the hops give bursts of lemongrass and spice to the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely balanced between bitter and sweet. This is definitely one of the bitterest pilsners I have tried, but the malty sweetness stands right up beside of this and the acidity is lightly tart, which makes this a very nice beer to sip. Right as the beer passes down the throat, the sweetness gets a touch too much, but other than that the beer has some great balance. The beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a nice, clean crisp mouthfeel, like most pilsners. There is a little more malt weight on the tongue than you usually find in the style. In taste, the beer begins surprisingly fruity as light lemongrass and sweet cracker, but the bitters thread beautifully into this with grassy and herbal characters, and the malt dries out a bit on the mid-palate, providing a dry-cracker flavor before dipping slightly towards sweet apple juice with a touch of wheat malt. The finish is light as sweet apple juice, mellow grassy hops, and light cracker malts. The aftertaste is clean and slight. Overall, this is a nice pilsner, and one I prefer to many others in the style. It is a little too sweet in places, but the extra malt gives some nice character to the beer. This is a nice twist on a classic style, and a good intro to Three Floyds for me. If you can get it regularly, I would advise this beer for a session, but I wouldn’t go whale-hunting for this one.","Maxwell","Oct 08, 2013"

Not much lacing, either. Aroma is mostly bready and caramel malt, and also light some floral hops and nuts. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there wasn't as much hoppiness as I expected for a Three Floyds brew. With that being said, it's still tasty. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and easy enough to drink. Not sure if I'd pay $10.99 a 6-pack for this again, but it's a good brew and I'm glad I got to try it.","bluejacket74","Mar 28, 2013"

Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one carried a big floral character to it throughout both the aroma and flavor.

3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Three Floyds Jinx Proof pours a hazy light orange, with almost three fingers of cream colored foam. There's a little bit of head retention, with not much lacing left to speak of. The nose has lots of bready malts, and a fair bit of minerals and herbal hops. The flavor largely follows that blueprint. The cracker and bread maltiness that leads off is a bit more crisp than in the aroma. The bitterness that rolls in mid palate is pleasantly mild, with just enough snap to briefly grab my attention. The finish is largely herbal, with just a little bit of a mineral edge. The beer manages to avoid harsh grassy flavors that I sometimes get from German style lagers with a noticeable hop presence. The body has a nice firmness to it, but the carbonation essentially dies off by the middle of each sip, rendering the beer a bit dull. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Jinx Proof, as it comes from a style of beers I'm not typically fond of.","axeman9182","May 03, 2012"

Smell is of light, sweet malts with a little bit of spicy breadiness and a touch of pear, almost like a wheat beer. There is a large hop bitterness not evident in the nose, pushing the malt profile to the back of the palate. With no hop on the nose, I find the bitterness more detrimental than anything to my enjoyment of the beer. This is a bit more aggressively hoppy than I like my lagers, which seems to be par for the course from FFF.","krembl","Mar 25, 2012"

Aromatics some mild citrus notes, but a really nice bready cereal grain note that was really inviting in the warm weather. Not crazy complex big or bitter just a nice Dortmunder style, fairly different compared to the standard I judge all other export style lagers to, Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. But this was well made clean crisp with a great toasted breadiness, amongs the herbal citric hop additions, made to style and it shows why 3Fs is successful not just because of their big beers, but they actually know how to brew. Mouthfeel was lighter bodied ample carbonation for style flows nicely, I'm wishing I had access to a couple bombers of this or any 3Fs for that matter. Overall experience was a great way to start things out highly quaffable refreshing and goes to show not every great beer has to be on everybody's White Whale list.","WVbeergeek","Jun 15, 2011"

2.9,-20.1,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Poured from bomber (no date stamp) into dimpled mug. Pours a yellow-golden colored body mostly clear, but with a slight haze. Finger-width, fizzy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing throughout the session. Aroma is a lightly sweetened grainy, pils malt with a light herbal hop backing. Flavor is a richer grainy malt with a medium sweetness. A touch of bread and honey as well as a light fruit come in during the middle before this finishes with a light to moderate level of herbal, grassy bitterness and a pinch of spice. Dry and crisp with a somewhat flat lingering aftertaste which was disappointing to me especially coming from 3F. Medium body, smooth, and a soft carbonation. Overall, this tasted like a regular macro pils. Its straightforward brew that provides a crisp and hop bitterness. Definitely an unusual release from FFF, but it proves to me that they're not just all about the juicy hop and malty bombs. Good point there.","CuriousMonk","Mar 18, 2011"

This beer pours a nice golden color with a decent white head on it. The smell was not particularly strong in any regard. All I was able to grasp was some light sweet malt notes on the nose, but really there wasn't much there. The flavor was a quality mixture of lots of pilsner malt and some bready biscuit malt. It was a nice mug of liquid bread that I had the opportunity to taste, that the way I look at this beer. The mouthfeel was oddly flatter than I would have anticipated due to the lightness of this beer. It was good and drinkable.","Vdubb86","Feb 02, 2011"

The taste holds notes of wheat, flowers, and light greens. The hop character is decidedly subdued. The body is a sturdy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish.

3.93,8.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Beer is medium to light in body, minimal carbonation in the mouth. Great mouthfeel with some estery notes and some minimal bitterness. The forward is mildly sweet but all is well connected, highly drinkable. A little bigger in the mouth would have improved it and a cleaner back palate presence. Overall a good lager and I would drink it again for sure.","yeahnatenelson","Mar 20, 2010"

3.98,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The palate opens with a firm bitterness with a beautiful grassy, earthy and herbal hop character, along with a little lemon. The mid-palate has crackery and biscuit-malts with a grainy, husky character. I'm also getting a little citrus hop character, making me think this was a leaning little bit towards an American interpretation when fresher. Drying and bitter on the finish, there is an excellent hop bite. Remarkably flavorful, this light-bodied beer has high carbonation and is exceptionally drinkable. If only I could get this by the six-pack at a reasonable price, I'd be sold.","corby112","Nov 24, 2009"
4.05,11.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,5,"Surprisingly hop forward for a pilsner although it is Three Floyds so I guess I shouldn't be too shocked. This provides a nice dry earthy character that lasts throughout even though it is nicely balanced by a slightly malty backbone with lots of golden wheat, bready yeast, light crisp fruit, citrus peel and peppery spice. Very well balanced, light, crisp and refreshing. Perfect for the warmer months although there is two feet of snow on the ground right now. Nice dry grassy hop finish that gives it a crisp bite. Very good.","nickd717","Nov 18, 2009"

I have had a lot worse beers than this and to be honest I could drink this over and over if I had some. It's a nice beer to drink when you don't want to wreck your taste buds and want a easy drinker.","alleykatking","Jul 25, 2009"

3.62,-0.3,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Arrives medium yellow in a pint glass at the FFF brewpub with only enough head to let you know they didn't forget to carbonate it. Aroma says they looked east rather than west for most of the hops, definitely Saaz with a bit of a kick, perhaps their kettle is permanently infused with Amarillo. The flavor is a pretty straight reading of a Czech pilsner. A very serviceable and well-executed effort, but I sat and waited to find out what FFF had done to twist this style, but was only left with a little heavier body than a traditional plis. Overall a respectable effort, but a surprisingly normal take on a classic style for a brewery with the slogan "its not normal."","MillRat","Jun 19, 2009"
3.54,-2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Decent, spritzy mouthfeel but just not light enough for my taste. An easy-to-drink beer, but there are better options for this style. Easily the least impressive beer to come out of Munster.","malcontent","Jun 13, 2009"
3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours thinly veiled pale gold with a stubborn head that leaves ribbons of lace all the way down the glass. Smell is fresh bread with slight whiffs of lemon zest and grassy notes. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy for the style but there's enough carbonation there to keep this on the refreshing side. The flavors are very well balanced: the sweet breadiness blends seemslesly with the earthy hop bitterness. No one flavor speaks out of turn. Not quite as crisp a finish as I was expecting, but overall this is a very nice journey into the lager world for this ale powerhouse.","chicagobeerriot","Beers"
4.42,21.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Flavor is the same as the nose, but more intense. Starts ouf with fabulous pilsener complexities, roundly dry and bitter. Ends with a sweet balance from a finish which is like walking through a hayfield at dawn.","mynie","0"
