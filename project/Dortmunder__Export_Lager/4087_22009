3.43,36.1,3.5,3,3.75,3,3.5,"Had it in an airport hotel in-room minibar, in Sweden. Yes, this is a macrobrew, but as some of the other reviewers have stated, it's quite drinkable. Yellow in color, a bit of lacing, had a sour smell, not overpowering. The taste is quite sweet, but not in a cloying easy. Well-balanced, with a bit of a sour aftertaste. Quite refreshing, and I'd happily drink it again.","branko7","Jan 11, 2013"

2.78,10.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Average in all ways, not really good but not bad either. Smells a bit of corn, all in all nothing special. Nevertheless I liked this beer and it served me well. I was still able to drink much with my friends, when I had a sore throat! It was very smooth in all ways. Take it for what it is and enjoy. Just a typical beer to drink and have a good time.","Sachsenfreude","Jan 26, 2010"

2.15,-14.7,2.5,2.5,2,2,2,"Can- Thanks to Milos for this!A sparkling gold pour with a fizzy white cap. Nose of corn and vegetables, some wet paper, grains and biscuit. Tastes sweet, of grassy hops, grains and sweet veggies. Quick and assertive fizzy finish. Sometimes you just need to shake it like a polaroid picture.","mrmanning","Jun 27, 2009"

2,-20.6,2,2,2,2,2,"Got a can of this onboard the train from Lund to Stockholm, Sweden. Had a little head with no lace. Color was pale yellow. Aroma was beery with a little citrus. Flavor was common corn adjunct beer with a hint of citric tartness. Body was average for this kind of beer. Finish was the same and instantly forgettable. Mine was only cool and of course would be better cold.","drpimento","Aug 31, 2006"

2.73,8.3,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"A friend gave me a 33CL can from a recently trip to Sweden. Poured in a glass, the brew presented a thick white head that rapidly dissipated with almost non-existent lacing. Nose was weakly malted. Color was nice golden yellow. This beer has excessive carbonation. This was the one feature that caught my attention about this beer as I have never seen a beer this active before. The taste was dry which I dont mind. The beer is quite bitter initially, but tones down as the glasses end nears. Mouth feel is thin and watery. While I would not turn down another if offered, I will not seek out this brew as many far better lagers are available.","smdshack","Jul 24, 2005"
