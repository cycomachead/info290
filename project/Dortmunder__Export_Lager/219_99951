3.75,2.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours to a huge sudsy detergent-like head that reduces to 3/8" and patchy lacing. Color is deep golden. Aroma is malty honey sweetness and grassy, herbal hops. Flavor is light pilsner and biscuit malt notes and sweet white wine and grassy/citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is light and "smooth". Overall a tasty lager with good hop flavors.","EagleTalon","Mar 12, 2014"
