2.25,-33.2,,,,,,"500ml bottle. Bottle labelled as Amber Pils (and also as "bitter aromatic"). Pours a straw colour with a towering, frothy white head which settled reasonably and left only a trace of lacing. Very gentle aroma malt, hay and hops. Light sweetness and bitterness. Light to medium body with some fizz. Long gently bitter finish. Someone should have a word to their marketers because this doesn't fit the Pils mould nor is it particularly bitter or aromatic. That said it's very light, inoffensive but still quite drinkable.","magpieken","Dec 10, 2014"

Light carbonation, light body. Taste is the same as smell: grains, flowers and some biscuit. Just another correct beer more.","janubio","Jul 12, 2013"

3.94,16.9,3,4,4,4,4,"Flavors of toasty puffed wheat, clean grains, dry subtle noble hop bitterness. Very clean and simple, but flavorful and unique at the same time. No flaws or off flavors. Dry aftertaste, not sweet. Extremely drinkable, light bodied and smooth. Something from the Polish lager category that seems to transcend a little bit, which is surprising.","emerge077","Jul 28, 2012"

3.03,-10.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"This beer was "accidentally" opened at work today, so I figured I'd partake in its contents for the sake of it. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, hard water, light grass, and flowers. Everything is mild and muddled (in an inoffensive way). The taste brings in more of the same, with the grass and flowers coming through a bit more powerfully, though not enough to really help this beer claw its way out of mediocrity. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a nice little beer, better than I expected (thanks to some bad experiences with pale Polish lagers), but nothing at all memorable.","TMoney2591","Jan 20, 2012"

3.1,-8,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"O: All-in-all one of the better Polish standards I've had. Apart from a light body, some sweetness and a bit high ABV, this is a nice, malty and grassy lager, good for warm summer days - or with lighter foods.","stjaernstoft","Aug 12, 2011"
3.38,0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a bottle at EuroMarket in Astoria. Aside from the bit of skunk, this is a decent beer. Shame about the green glass bottle. There's a crisp bready toast with just a touch of caramel. Slight spicy hops finish the beer is what seems to be a fine, but abused, example of the style. I hope to find a fresher find some day.","tempest","Mar 16, 2011"

3.09,-8.3,2.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This is fairly agreeable in flavor with a little malt and a tiny bit of hops and an overall grainy, almost vegetative quality to the malt. However, it is inoffensive and slightly watery, and the finish is crisp and somewhat bitter. More or less what I expected, although not altogether terrible. This is comparable to most of Poland's top lagers and better than a few, not that there aren't higher compliments I could give a beer.","daliandragon","Jan 02, 2009"

2.83,-16,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear straw gold with a fast falling white head. Nose is like dirty grain. Flavor exhibits much the same qualities. Just a bland and boring lager.

3.65,8.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pale golden yellow appearance with a nice white head when poured carefully out of the half liter bottle. Crystal clear. Rich malty aroma accompanied with a musty, flowery hopiness. Eastern European feel to it. Quite tasty in a heartier lager sense. Malt sweetness abounds in this lager, lingering hoppiness in the finish. I could enjoy this one again.","crookedhalo","Nov 12, 2003"
4.13,22.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Nothing quenches the thirst like a fine Polish lager, and the Lomza Export is certainly no expection. This beer pours a pale yellow with a F-4 Maelstrom of carbonation (common to many polish lagers). Smell is sweet and malty and the taste is very similar. I like diversification, but I do lean towards sweeter beers and this one appeals to me more, probably, because of its underlying sweetness. This beer went perfectly with my melted mozarella topped soft pretzel and home made beer cheese. HEAVEN!","TripelJ","Jul 04, 2003"
3.1,-8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"On the pour a translucent golden amber color with a pretentious head, and nice covering lace. Light hints of yeast, but malt dominates the nose, crisp and clean, pleasant. A bit over sweet at the start with the top shamefully thin and the finish scantily hopped with a middling carbonation and the ever present dry and lingering aftertaste, just to Thin-waisted for me, but still a drinkable beer when you want something light.","Gusler","Dec 26, 2002"
3.97,17.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"From Lomza Brewery in Poland. Pale gold. Medium light body. Mild bitterness. Mild hops. Medium malt. Dry. Reminicsent of grains, fresh fruits. Rounded and pleasantly refreshing and tasty. Not bad 5.7% ABV. Nice label of polish villagers in costumes.","stoutman","Dec 25, 2002"
3.95,17.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a crystal clear golden body capped by a foamy bright white head that holds fairly well; dropping to a creamy collar that's buoyed by carbonation. The nose expresses clean, sweet, grainy malt with a mild floral hoppiness in the background. The body is light/medium with a fine and gently effervescent carbonation. It's lightly crisp on the tongue at first, becoming smooth and creamy in the mouth as it warms. Very nice! The flavor reaffirms the malty sweetness suggested by the aroma, but also shows more complexity. It's very well balanced by a spicy and gently citrusy (lemon, lime) hop flavor and bitterness. It finishes dry with some residual grainy/grassy malt sweetness, mild peppery hoppiness, and a touch of alcohol (which is surprising for a beer of only 5.7%). A really surprisingly good pilsener! Quite refreshing, delicate, and interesting. Certainly worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 29, 2002"
2.83,-16,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,4,"Export Lomza:  In a funky little bottle.  Pale golden colored beer, with a foamy, pure white head.  Clean, grainy aroma.  Very light in body and in taste, with adjuncty flavor, of grain, and the barest hint of malt.  Clean, dry finish.  Not too bad, hella easy to drink, but there’s lots better out there.","jackndan","Oct 13, 2002"
