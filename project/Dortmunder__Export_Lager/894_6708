3.3,-6.5,,,,,,"Malt goes along with leather and tobacco, becomes a little sweeter as taste lingers on the palate, toffeish, then gets rolled over by a very livley metallic carbonation. A soft touch of yeast adds smoothness to the mouthfeel, while barley and hops carry a zingy freshness.","aleigator","Dec 01, 2014"

I enjoyed one, i found the second a little bitter to the taste. I have only limited experience of Swedish beers but this tempts me to experiment further, as the intensity of the flavours is very much to my palate.","SirBob","Dec 29, 2013"

All in all, an easy drinking Dortmunder lager but I would personally expect a bit bolder hop and richer malt presence.","wl0307","Jul 20, 2013"

3.62,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: A better lager - it should be at 18.90 SEK à 330 ml. It's not for binge drinking, but it's a great match with most classic Swedish foods. A good alternative to both ales and lagers.","stjaernstoft","Jul 07, 2010"
4.05,14.7,2.5,2.5,4.5,5,5,"O: One of the best and most original lagers I've had. Very different take on a German style, and I would dare say outdoes the German varieties.","sfprint","Jul 06, 2010"

3.5,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice amber gold colored. Flavor is kind of thickly sweet and malty. Borders on sickly sweet, but doesn't quite get there. (seems like it's a "just barely" thing) the thick sweetness is probably masking any other potential characteristics from showing well. It's okay, but too fuzzy and lacking sharp definition.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2009"
4.12,16.7,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This has a good feel to it, plenty of body for a lager, be it a Dort or an Export, and enough flavours to make it stand out from the crowd.","BlackHaddock","Sep 18, 2009"

3.54,0.3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall: this Swedish lager was a nice surprise. Well-balanced, it results in a crisp and refreshing lager with a marked personality and a nice malt character without forgetting its hoppy strengths.","AlexLMS","Feb 10, 2008"
