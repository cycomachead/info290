3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall / Drinkability: Since I had this at the table while the Mrs. was having the normal Dortmunder Gold, I took a sip of hers in comparison, and indeed, it's like they doubled the normal Dortmunder Gold recipe. More hops, more malt, but still quite good. Due to the higher ABV, need to stop at one, but easily could have another. A nice beer and I'm glad they brought it back to the brewery.","damndirtyape","Nov 04, 2009"

Quite sweet and malty, as well as a bit fruity. Notes of toasted grains and bread, apples and pears, a bit grassy. A notch or two better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Not too bad if you dig a big sweet lager.","ClockworkOrange","Beers"
3.46,-11.3,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, not a beer I am too impressed with. If I am going to be spending that much money on something like this I will get a 12 pk of an adjunct for the same price as the 4 pk. Simply a letdown.","mothman","0"
3.85,-1.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Sweet malt mixed with hops and some alcohol. Hops are quite prominent, more than one would expect in the style, and the alcohol is quite hot, which detracts from both mouthfeel and drinkability. At this strength, this is a sipper. I doubt that I would want more than one. Still, a pretty tasty beer, but given a choice, I would opt for the Dortmunder Gold, and will the next time I'm in Ohio.","kwakwhore","Aug 05, 2009"
4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: Very nice, it's got great flavors and is wonderful summer beer - a bit more filling than a standard export lager so it would be a bit heavier to attempt a couple, and the ABV is just a tad higher as well.

Tastes of hops and a good dose of sweet malt at the end. Got this in a BIF and this is the first time I have had this style. Seems to me to be a solid brew that doesn't leave me with too much to remember. Overall seems good in all areas but not great.

4.13,5.9,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Wonderful clear honey color with a small, creamy head and lots of carbonation. Smells very malty and citrusy with notes of apricot, pear and apple and some northern hops in the background. Initial taste is very sweet and malty, with all the cirtus flavors coming through and developing as it goes, followed by a nice balance of hopping and a lingering malt flavor. Very well-balanced and robust for a lager. Medium body and easy to drink and enjoy. Another treat from one of my favorite breweries.","Thanby","Feb 19, 2009"
4.45,14.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: The mouth feel is medium with some carbonation. The finish is medium light and last for a few moments.

Quite sweet, but not cloyingly so with a candy/lemon/floral hoppiness. Quite rich feeling, both in flavour and mouthfeel. Finish is refreshingly bitter and cuts through the sweetness admirably. Reminds me a bit of turkish delight with it's rich, floral sweetness and heavy body. The hops are just strong enough to balance out the sweetness from the malt. Big, sweet and rich without being overwhelming. Very well done.","allergictomacros","Jan 25, 2009"

3.35,-14.1,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"To me, this beer is one of those "Why??" beers. Their regular Dortmunder is really good, so why go with the trend and "Imperialize" it? I know it's an anniversary beer, but why mess with the beer that made you? I guess you have to try new things once in a while. It's fun to try this beer once because nobody else will make an Imperial Dortmunder. It's kind of a novelty beer.","AltBock","Jan 21, 2009"

3.48,-10.8,4,3.5,3,4,4,"12oz bottle. Clear golden pour with a creamy white head. Malt, some floral/citrus hop, bready aroma. Flavor is similar, dominated by a bready malt. The hops really seem to have a tough time coming through. A fair amount of carbonation bordering on creamy. Finish pretty clean/dry. This is drinkable, but I think the regular dortmunder is better.","Bung","Dec 30, 2008"
3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Admittedly, this sample has grown a little long in the tooth already. I tried it out before hand, contemplated, and in the end decided it was still in good enough form to review. Although I might have enjoyed a little more a month or two ago, I don't think I would have been much more impressed. Imperial or otherwise, it's not any better than other Dortmunders I've tried.","biegaman","Dec 24, 2008"

3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly fogged barely brown orange with a white head. Nose is minimal with a sweet grain thing that's all that's going on. Flavor is fairly sweet. There's a minor edge of citric fruit edge. Consistent, by doesn't go beyond it's one dimension. Feel is slick on liquid and low on carbonation. Drinkable, yes. If you appreciate the style, you'll dig this.","RblWthACoz","Dec 22, 2008"
3.76,-3.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D - An unusual beer which seems to have the ingredients to pay tribute to the dortmunder style yet also morphs into a malty strong beer unlike the original in simplicity. The complex malt textures are very tasty, but make this a beer I would not normally consider drinkable, but interesting and well worth a try - Kudos to Great Lakes for producing this unique lager.","Slatetank","Dec 21, 2008"
3.43,-12.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a clear dark gold with 2 fingers of foamy white head. Nice retention yields some lacing wisps. Smells of sweet caramel and honey, fruits, brown sugar, floral and spicy hops, and slight alcohol. Tastes of honey, caramel malt, apples, grapes, a touch of lemon, grain, and brown sugar with a floral hop finish with a good bit of alcohol warmth. Medium in body with ok carbonation. Sweet with some good bitterness, but as the beer warms up, the alcohol dominates. An ok brew, but I'll stick with Great Lakes regular Dortmunder Gold next time.","HopDerek","Dec 17, 2008"

Taste is a bit sweet with lots of fruit on the tongue. Lots of malt, a little bit of alcohol and some grass in there as well. Body is medium to thick, mouthfeel is creamy and maybe a little sticky, carbonation is crisp.

There seems to be a hint of veggies in the front with juicy pilsner taste. The beer is very syrupy and leads you to believe that it clocks in higher than 7.3%.

Almost like hop honey dripping on an English muffin. The taste is a lovely hop and toasted malt flavor. Very smooth toasted malts tht tste just like liquid white toast. Don't forget the syrup hop jelly on that toast. Adds a note of pine to the bread. Very crisp clean, malt heavy and hop heavy palate. This beer brings a lot of flavors to the palate.

Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is sweet malt, bread, citrus fruit and grassy hops. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the bready malt and hops flavors are the strongest. Good balance between the malt and hops although it is a bit more malty as the sweetness is a bit more noticable compared to the bitterness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's well carbonated (bubbles are always slowly coming up from the bottom of the glass to the top) and has a slightly dry finish. Drinkability is good too, it's smooth and very easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall I think this is a very good brew, another winner from Great Lakes!","bluejacket74","Sep 24, 2008"

The EtOH adds just a touch of spice to the overall picture. Otherwise, I get a bold flavored balance of malt and hops on the palate, with the scale being tipped in favor of the malt flavors.

Smell has a deep floral herbal grassy kick going down, definitely some noble hops kicking. The great pungent hop aroma is literally wrapped with honey drizzled fresh baked biscuits with a touch of noticeable alcohol. That is fuckin' awesome, a bigger version of one of my favorite lagers that still retains it's balance and original concept of the little brother. Flavor wave rides heavy with cereal malts and deep honey sweetness, fresh baked split wheat toasted with honey and butter describes the meat of the malt backbone. Hop profile doesn't bash you but you fully understand why Dortmunder Gold is such a world class beer. More flowery hops with herbal and grassy layers very noble hop esque in general. Definitely worth the hype of this very limited released brew. Mouthfeel is pretty clean nothing heavy sitting on the palate, carbonation is even very smooth 7.5 abv is barely noticeable very balanced yet flavorful.

The aromas are deeply malty with hints of herbal hops, moderate alcohols, and touches of cereal grains here and there. Flavors are rich and malty, but taking on Imperail Pilsner and Malt Liquor sweetness that prove a little much for my taste. Although the beer is dry-hopped, the presence of hops either in the bittering or flavor offer little reprieve from the heavy malt-grain flavors. Moderately weighted with some silickness and a slow alcohol burn late. Finishes quite crisp for such sweetness.

4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was a little skeptical of the Imperial Dortmunder style when I heard about this beer. But, I'm a believer. Great Lakes brewed the perfect beer for their 20th anniversary. It's a classic representation of everything that is Great Lakes. Straight forward, damn tasty, smooth as can be, and extremely drinkable. Happy 20th! Looking forward to many more to come.","prototypic","Jul 09, 2008"

4.4,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall a very good beer but at $10 a 4 pack I couldn't drink it all of the time (that would buy me 2.5 gallons of gas and take me 50 miles!! ;)","JDK","Beers"
4.58,17.4,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"D- great lakes is known for extremely well rounded beers and it's a no-brainer that their 20th anniversary beer would be a knockout. very drinkable for something so full and flavorful with a decent amount of alcohol. happy anniversary, baby.","hustlesworth","0"
4.12,5.6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, nice to see this anniversary beer as a take on their flagship brew. I always find the regular dortmunder to be a refreshing session beer. This still resembles that beer, but takes some of the drinkability out of it and beefs up the body and alcohol. I enjoyed this on tap a little more than the bottle, the finish was a little cleaner and the alcohol was a little more masked.","yourefragile","Jul 06, 2008"
4.54,16.4,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Overall this is a dry beer on the palate. The beer has a crisp feel to it. This beer has a great body...I want to say that it is medium-heavy, however, the carbonation makes it hard to say this. Carbonation levels in this brew toy with the palate, they make the beer feel lighter on the palate than it is. When ignoring the carbonation the beer feels medium heavy, when including it and feeling the beer as a whole it feels much lighter due to the higher levels of carbonation. This is one I'll have to pick up again, after all the 20th anniversary only happens once! Don't miss this beer.","becktone","Jul 06, 2008"
3.82,-2.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Very pale golden color-not a lot of carbonation or head. Ok aroma-malty and grainy-mild hop presence. Somewhat bitter and skunk like. Full and malty flavor. Nice, heavy bitter flavoring going on. Somewhat sharp and metallic but that has to be between the hop levels and a slight alcohol presence. Certainly not unpleasant. Good, full body-more so then a plain old Dortmunder. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Comes off as a milder form of some of the "super lagers" you get in Europe. Nice beer.","lackenhauser","Jul 06, 2008"
4.11,5.4,5,4,4,4.5,4,"D: Obviously not as drinkable as the original but a good and interesting pick for a 20th Anniversary. I'm very glad they didn't do the cliche RIS or DIPA, though I'm really looking forward to my trip upstate when they release BA Blackout again.","pwoods","Jul 04, 2008"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Very nice beer. Literally tastes like they just doubled everything. Creamy in the mouth showing a drawn out finish. That lager refreshment on the end with a warming alcohol and prickly carbonation. Honey dew, sap, breads, biscuit, bitter on the end with piney almost herbal hops. A good beer however I think the regular Dortmunder is more well rounded. Why double it?","mcallister","Jul 01, 2008"
4.64,19,5,3.5,5,5,5,"Wow. It was worth the wait!! The appearance is a lovely dark yellow/ light orange hue. The smell was of a very strong alcohol presence, truthfully a little off putting, then you drink it. Lovely sweet malty tones make this beer start and finish well. It has been a half hour since my last drink and I still can taste the lovely sweet finish on my lips! This is a very drinkable beer, which at 7.5% ABV can be trouble! I would have to say this is my favorite Great Lakes brew and I hope it is not a one time thing!","ianranderson","Jun 30, 2008"

It poors a pretty amber color, average to above average smell for a lager - but the taste is so smooth and refreshing!!! The brewery was a buzz about this beer, if you can get your hands on it, please do - you will not be dissappointed!","Bones54","0"
