I prefer Eliot Ness to this, but either would be absolutely perfect as that lawn mowing, game time, bbq, go to beer, and for turning a BMC drinker into a craft drinker","Bone53","Sunday at 06:25 PM"

Though I try to avoid using the word "drinkability" I can't dodge it here. Thankfully, however, drinkability with this beer does not mean tastelessness or watered down flavor. I highly recommend this beer.","LoganRyanMurphy","Nov 13, 2014"

Based on how good this beer is a and the awards its won, I'm not too upset that this is the lone representative of the style for me. As advertised, it is a gorgeous gold beer that falls between a pilsner and a vienna lagger in terms of flavor profile. The taste and mouthfeel work excellently together to create a beer that is both highly drinkable, yet complex. I will undoubtedly get this again next time I am in Ohio.","Bockrules","Sep 23, 2013"

This is just a great beer, and would be a good choice to get somebody's feet wet into the world of craft beer.

It's probably me, as there are so few examples of this style on the shelf these days but on its own, this is an enjoyable beer that deserves a wider audience, since it's quite enjoyable and likely to not offend anyone.","JerzDevl2000","May 20, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, pepper, floral, grass, bread, cracker, honey, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and moderate ester notes; with good strength. Taste of bread, toast, cracker, pear, apple, pepper, floral, grass, light honey, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, toast, pepper, floral, honey, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of bready malt and spicy hop flavors; with light-moderate fruity ester notes and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dortmunder as expected. Great balance of hop and malt flavor; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

Tastes lager all the way...a rich, malty, cleansing, fizzy, foamy, slick drink with a good high note and the finest piney hoppiness that lingers like a mild IPA. Bolder for the style, for sure.

The taste was crisp, which to me was very surprising for a Lager. Nonetheless, by the end of my time, and fifth one, I had the whole group drinking this brew. Good times, definitely a recommend, am gonna try to procure some for my journey back to Texas before I leave.","Abbbp","Mar 10, 2013"

The malt contribution is much bigger in the flavor, with a dry bready/biscuity character complementing a musty, grassy, dull bitterness.

Tastes dry with a tinge of honey towards the end. Like a nice mix between a pilsner and a cream ale. A tad bitter on the finish, though not unpleasant. One of my favorites.

The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty good too, it had a solid crisp bit at the end too. Overall it's a good lager, very traditional in style but remains to be very good.","Knapp85","Dec 24, 2011"

But Dortmunder Gold has earned it's gold. It's proven and delicious. One of the best all around lagers in the world. Gold is not just a way of describing the color of this brew, but a way of describing its character and class. Nothing overly brilliant. Just a damn good tasting beer anyone can enjoy.

The nuttiness of the malts really starts to come out on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's fairly thick for a lager, but feels good going down. The drinkability is superb.

It is very clear and has nice color. It smells of pale malts, light yeast, light breadiness, and grains with light spices. The flavors begin with a dry lightly fruity, almost pilsner esque sweetness. The biscuity malts are prevalent and pair nicely with the citrus flavor that is also presented. It finishes pretty dry. This drinks light and body and is pretty smooth. It coats the palate and leaves a moderate biscuit flavor behind. Overall it's a pretty good Dortmunder. It's one of the better ones out there so it's worth a try.","aasher","Jun 17, 2011"

This beer definitely gives you that thin bodied bitter feel that makes lagers suck, but adds a nice hint of maple…or honey? The malt complexity is nice, and gives a little bit of a bready taste…but it doesn’t come on as strong as some other German styles.

The mouth feel is a nice firm taste that grips the cheeks on goes down smoothly. This is a very good summer drink with its crisp clean feel that is very drinkable. This style of lager is much better than the american macros like budweiser, coors, or miller high-life, reminds me a little bit of American Badass, and Moosehead, but with a stronger taste and more flavor to it. After trying this I think this is the beer that other brew masters are going to wish their beers were as good as this if your looking for a good crisp clean beer that most Americans would be used to when it comes to taste, appearance, smell, mouth feel and drinkability.","DannyDan","Dec 07, 2010"

To the extent that hops are detectable on the nose, they're floral. The flavors are more complex than the nose suggested, with a malty start and an orange citrusy flavor that enters on the mid-palate and grows in strength to the point of achieving balance by the end.

Floral, mild pine. Where the beer comes alive is in the mouthfeel. It's perhaps the ideal weight for a lager with enough heft to stand up to food and flexibility enough to be enjoyed in beyond responsible quantities. Slightly creamy as well, with a light hop finish.

Pours a bright, pale amber color with two-fingers of dense, white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. The aroma is not that potent but it smells nicely balanced between the pale malt and hops. Not as malty as Munich lagers, not as dry as a Pilsner, fits this beer perfectly. The flavor blends all the best parts of the various German lagers. Solid bready malt base balanced perfectly by spicy hops. Notes of some citrus hops as well in the finish to add more flavor. The body is rich and smooth for a light lager. Might be just a touch overcarbonated. I could drink this all the time, any season of the year. I just wish it was cheaper.","morimech","May 11, 2010"

4.09,0.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Good finger's worth of close to tan foam, nice frothy look, whipped up, the lacing possesses adequate stickiness. Clear deep orange with as much red influence as yellow, has a metallic brightness to it. Oats, grains, corn husk and some pepperiness most noticeable in the nose, uncooked bread dough, honey glaze, wildflowers, mixed white fruit, no one element jumps out at you but it remains full and satisfying as a whole. Medium-bodied, sets itself widely yet never heavy. The dough here closer to sourdough or pumpernickel, sweet like browner bread than honeyed. Soft carbonation adds to the overall pliancy, yields but doesn't give. Deeper apricot, peach fruit, the citrus mixed in composition but also more resonant. The maltiness betrays traces of cocoa and mocha, not sweet chocolate. Smooth as she goes through the finish, the hoppiness more a bracing perfume than flavor on the tongue. Quaffable without ever seeming simple.","farrago","Mar 14, 2010"

Great Lakes did a great job of balancing this Lager with a near perfect amount of herbal and citrus hops. The brew dries up fairly quickly, although there is a little remaining sweetness.

Lots of white bread malt notes, caramel, soft herbal hops, honey and a touch of toastyness. Also, I am detecting some toffee in the finish. Delicious. Very well balanced with just enough bitterness to balance out the malt character. Medium bodied with a very nice clean finish that is not too sweet or dry. This beer would go great with a sports game or BBQ. Very well executed. It is no wonder that it has been a gold medal winner.

Flavors of slightly buttery grain and a very slight copper tinge. As mentioned, this might be a bit rich for lighter beer fans, so drinkability is not the main feature of this beer.

It's been years since I've had this and I never much cared for it before, but I quite like it now. Must be a maturing palette.

The pint was delivered to me perfectly full so there was no head to speak of but the thin collar of beige lacing did retain well and lace appropriately. The aroma was of caramel malt, dry grains and floral hops. The flavors were just plain outstanding for a lager, displaying a perfect balance of grassy hops and sweet malts, both caramel and toasted. The flavor profile started sweet followed by some light lemon notes in the middle before it proceeded to a bitter, but crisp and dry finish. The body was medium, the carbonation perfect and the mouthfeel smooth. One of the best food beers I have ever encountered. Sessionable, balanced, on-point for the style and easily paired with any food. This brewery is famous for a good reason and I would rate this one up there with their Edmund Fitzgerald as an all-time favorite. Simply put, if you see it, don't miss it.","thekevlarkid","Nov 03, 2009"

The smell has a funky vinyl or plastic quality to it that was a little off-putting. The taste is dry and grainy. It's nicely balanced up front with bready fresh cut hay flavors and a pleasant bitterness. Theese flavors give way to a little bit of metalic and skunk aftertaste. Tastes like an import is the easiest way to describe it. I'm not as in love with this stuff as alot of people seem to be. It does grow on you. It goes down very nicely and the third or fourth is better than the first. Maybe the style just isn't my thing. I'm sure this tastes exactly like it is supposed to taste. Great lakes knows what they are doing. Personally if we are talking about a good lager, just give me a nice crisp pilsener or even a macro. This just wasn't great for me.","lester619","Oct 23, 2009"

There is a nice biscuit graham cracker presence in the malt profile and I'm also picking up some subtle faint light crisp fruit, mostly apple and pear. The hops provide a nice bitterness that is prominent up front and lingers above the complex maltiness into a nice dry finish. Very well balanced and very drinkable.","corby112","Sep 21, 2009"

The right combination of hops and malt, while still being both crisp and smooth. The perfect craft alternative to people who want an American macro.

Wonderfully balanced, and full of the aforementioned biscuit malts, and grassy, earthy hops that linger on the tongue. A touch of grape fruitiness and a little more alcohol than I would like. Mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer is minerally, and I'm sure that one could put away several of these.

This bottle and six-pack, I am convinced, were not "on their game", so to speak. Something was up with the smell and the flavor that wasn't like Dortmunder Gold I have sampled in the past.

The taste is sharp at first, with a sweet malt note that finishes into a balanced hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue.

The bitter is clean of grassy co-humulone, so it's quite nice. Carbonation is strong, which adds to the drying finish and gives a slight acrid tang to the aftertaste. Md mouthfeel results from a battle between dextrinous mouthfeel with the dried out malt. Plus strong carbonation lifts the beer off the tongue. Really nice.","mentor","Aug 09, 2008"

Dortmunder Gold is perhaps the most popular of the Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s beers, and for good reason as it is well balanced and chances are your bud light drinking buddy will actually like this. In my opinion this is a great beer overall but I prefer many other beers made by this brewer. Pours a clean copper almost light amber color with a full head that tends to simmer down. Strong carbonation and lacing are always present. The aroma is appealing although very mild for my taste. A slight hop aroma is given off just enough to tickle the nose. The flavor is very good and extremely balanced, the malts and hops seem to be in perfect harmony.

This beer is very smooth on the pallet and provides a decent amount of mouth-feel especially for the style. It has just the right amount of hops, which provide a bitter sensation at the center (longitudinally), spanning from the back to the middle (back to front) of the tongue. I've had this beer out of both a stange, and a pint glass. It is better tasting out of the pint glass, at the expense of the superior aroma from the stange.","epiinephriine","Jul 06, 2008"

The beer pour a bright golden and has a very flavorful smell. The smell is not misleading as the flavor is both light and not overwhelming, but has an enjoyable bite and goes down well. Though it feels light, I'm not sure its a real session beer, though I'm sure it will work that way. If you love beer and are visiting Ohio, buy a great lakes sampler that includes this beer.

The only thing I could compare this too would be a thick version of Miller High Life. Pale, foamy head that quickly dissipates, and a bit funky.

Just a pleasant smelling beer overall. Taste is of mild buttery biscuit, mild caramel malt, and mild citrus hop. Overall, this one is extremely balanced with an amazing bouquet of flavors. Aftertaste is pretty weak, but has hints of grain and wheat. Light to medium body with a fair carbonation. Very interesting brew, it grew on me after a few sips.

Very refreshing indeed, a good beer to have a number of in the fridge, particularly this time of year.","objectivemonkey","Jul 16, 2007"

The hops bring a sharpness to the beer's taste, while the malt smooths out the feel. While the taste favors the hops, there malt serves as a counterbalance, and due to the floral influences, plays off the hops nicely.

Light golden, borderline amber body that is very clear, lively carbonation goes to the top, the head was thick, but goes away within a few minutes. The nose is very grassy, almost smells like fresh cut hay, a little yeasty, European bread smelling. Strong grassy taste on the tongue, blends into a slight spiciness, a dry nutty taste with a clean finish with just the slightest hop spice lingering in the mouth.

This beer is exceptional, fantastic flavor and crispness, a great choice for session beer. I use this beer on alot of bmc drinkers, as an introduction to craft beer.

Smells very malty, balanced evenly with hoppy spiciness. Taste is malty at first contact, segues into hop bitterness as beer makes its way to being swallowed. Mouthfeel is typical lager fare.

Everything stays nicely balanced right through to the dryish finish, with the bitterness lingering on even longer.

Grassy, earthy, herbal European hops greet my nose and blend with some grainy malts. Flavor is crisp and dry - very refreshing. A large malt bill provides an impressively full and satisfying mouthfeel. Big biscuity malt flavors are at times a little toasty and dry, yet there is a pleasant underlying creaminess. Hops are perfectly balanced, adding quite a bit of bitterness to the flavor and finishing spicy. As the beer warms, it becomes slightly creamier and less dry. Aftertaste is toasty dry with lingering hops. Very well balanced lager, I am left wanting nothing.","BeerFink","Jul 20, 2005"

Slightly sweet malt and floral like smell that makes you want to dive right in. The taste is one of perfect balance. Grainy malt sweetness and crisp hop bitterness. Carbonation is right on. Feels alive in the mouth. Although it doesn't taste like an apple, it has a sweet/tart apple like thing going on. Very drinkable.

Nice lacing, too. A bit of bready Vienna and caramel malt sweetness and a touch of Hallertau hops. Very clean tasting, a thorough malty sweetness cut with a lightly herbal, bitter finish. Some light, fruity esters come into play. Quite outstanding in a sense of drinkability, despite a slightly higher ABV than your average lager. A quintessential example of the Dortmunder style of lager, rivaling some German examples. Very recommended for any lager lover.","crookedhalo","Mar 01, 2005"

One of the best lagers I have ever had. The one I sampled was marked "best before Nov 12, 2004" and I drank it toward the end of Feb 2005, and it was still quite good.

I really hate bringing up all these macro comparisons, but this truly is the beer to replace all macros. I could down these things by the case. The epidomy of session beer. This is an outstanding brew that anybody from the swill drinker to the person with the most refined pallete can appreciate.

It poured a nice gold with a two finger white head that made itself present for quite sometime. Aroma is fairly muted, but some floral notes do come through (which I love). Taste is very clean with just a nice malt flavor coming through at the end. Mouthfeel is ok with a medium body on this one. Drinkability rates high with me as this is a supreme session beer.

4.48,10.1,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep, reddish gold with a prominent head which fades rather quickly to a thin layer fed by beautiful carbonation. Earthy yeast aroma with lemon and orange peel hint on the nose. Slightly musty. Starts with a sharp hop bite and fairly dry, malt balance comes to play mid-beer. Grassy and sweeter towards the finish. Great lace clinging all the way down the glass. Overall very drinkable. A great session beer.","cretemixer","Jan 09, 2003"
3.88,-4.7,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"All in all, I'd have to take an educated guess that this is very good example of the Dortmund style of export beers. I find it a little too grainy to be delicious, but I'd love to drink a lot of these. This would be an ideal beer to have a liter of after some hard, sweaty work--the perfect amount of bitterness and body...","TXHops","Jan 06, 2003"
4.88,19.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"For me this beer is a go to, it is my trusty dog. One beer that does me right over and over again. The color of this Dortmunder Gold is a deep orangish gold with a huge white frothing head. An aroma full of citrusy grain that puts a smile on the drinkers face without thinking it is a pure reaction. I am not kidding take a whiff test my theory, and you'll be grinning like a little kid. This beer's flavor is so well balanced and crisp it is dangerously drinkable. It contains almost a sharp citrusy sweetness that dances with the tastebuds that equals pure enjoyment. This beer makes me want to pack my bags and make my way to Dortmunder. Awesome along with the other Great Lakes products.","WVbeergeek","Jan 03, 2003"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep golden color with a white head, smells slightly bitter, with a nice malty profile. This is one good lager, A little bit more body than alot of lagers, assertive hop presence with a nice malty backbone. I could drink these all night, and I have enjoyed them all night.","jtw5877","Dec 27, 2002"
4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy dark peach color, 1/4 inch small-bubbled head. Spicy cinnamon and slightly hoppy aroma. Nice mouthfeel, smooth and velvety pumpkin pie with elements of some light and slightly buttered toast and a little citrusy hop tang that gets more evident close to the swallow. Seems to mellow more with following sips, very agreeable and somewhat warming. Smooth and pleasant, nice beer here...","ADR","Dec 27, 2002"
4.28,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I know nothing about Dortmunder, but this is an excellent rust-belt brew... tasty, quality beer, yet completely unpretentious. It would be a great pick for tailgating, pizza night, etc.","shirfan","Dec 26, 2002"
4.55,11.8,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"If you're looking for a nice medium bodied brew, don't hesitate to tackle this one, particularly if you're looking for something with a little more bang than a simple pilsner.","49degrees","Dec 25, 2002"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This isn't my favorite style of beer but it's hard to find anything negative to say about it, another outstanding effort from Great Lakes. It pours a deep gold, honey color with a bright white sudsy head. Aroma contains lightly toasted sweet malt, a touch of caramel, plenty of fresh grain and some herbal hops. The taste is pretty much just like the smell. The great thing about this brew is that it is magnificently balanced and very smooth, easy to drink. This would make an excellent gateway brew for any macroswilling friends you may have. Give them a bottle of this and they will see the light! Hallelujah!","johnrobe","Dec 10, 2002"
4.25,4.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Slightly hazy with a very nice golden color. The foamy bright-white head holds fairly well before dropping to a decent collar. The aroma offers a clean and mildly grainy maltiness but no noticeable hops (which is OK for the style).The body is medium/light with a fine, moderate carbonation that leaves it crisp and smooth in the mouth. The flavor offers a grainy, lightly bready and softly honeyish malt that's well entwined with grassy and mildly floral hops. It finishes dry with a mild lingering maltiness. Very well balanced. I recently spent a week in Cleveland and enjoyed this quite regularly on draft. It's widely available and makes a refreshing change of pace. It's easy to drink and quite enjoyable pint after pint. I appreciate that they've kept it restrained and well balanced. Well made. Very nicely done.","NeroFiddled","Nov 21, 2002"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a thick foamy lace on top of a hazy orange-gold color.  The aroma is clean and crisp with citrus hints.  The extremely well balanced sweet malt with a brush of spice and a lingering mellow crisp bitterness.  Very flavorful, a definite favorite.","beernut7","Nov 14, 2002"
4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I wish the word "balance" wasn't used as often as it is. Instead it should be reserved to describe this beer. It is like a swiss watch. Caramel yet dry. Aromatic and bittering hops are in equal proportion. Full-bodied yet lifted by delicate acidity and fine bubbles. Every component balanced and working in harmony for a sensational experience, sinus to gut.","putnam","Nov 11, 2002"
4.04,-0.7,3,4,4,4,4.5,"This is quite a great beer.  Definitely not my favorite style of beer but it keeps me coming back for more.  The beer is golden with a very thick white head.  There is a floral aroma that permeates through the entire beer.  The hops are subdued but present making it a highly drinkable beer for all seasons.  Unique and delicious!","Maestro","Oct 13, 2002"
4.56,12,5,4,5,4,4.5,"Dortmunder Gold is truly golden in color, such a deep gold that it must be seen to sppreciate the depth of color this beer displays.  It has a great hop aroma which rivals a good bottle of Pilsner Urquell.  The taste is very full and satisfying, with the clean lager finish.  This beer will leave a lace that is extrordinary for a lager.  Truly an exceptional beer, which is not a surprise from Great Lakes.  My favorite traditional lager (thus far).","aaronh","Oct 09, 2002"
4.06,-0.2,5,4,4,4,4,"Had the draft version at the Renaissance in downtown Cleveland. Once again, Great Lakes can do no wrong in my book. Wonderful effervescence on the pour, and a nice off-white head. The lacing was what really impressed me though. Similar to how you can tell how old a tree is by counting the rings, the lacing allowed you to see the previous level where your beer was before each sip. So by the end I had a nice ripple effect down the entire length of the inside of my glass. I have never seen that before and it was very cool. As for the flavor, very good as well. Malty oat flavor. Another winner from GLBC.","Dogbrick","Oct 07, 2002"

4.51,10.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Wow! I found my new favorite lager. It pours a wonderful deep golden (very slight cloud) amber with a inch of fluff on top that didn't run and hide but laced very nice the whole glass. it drank super smooth, not bitter, but slightly sweet. A very drinkable brew with most any meal.If its the Dortmunder style that suprised me or the fact its from Cleveland. Wow!!","chilidog","Jul 16, 2002"
3.53,-13.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured nice dark golden color, forming a nice light head that left a wonderful lace after subsiding. An slight aroma of hops and citrus. It had a slightly tangy flavor from the hops that seems to give it a good finish. Decent body for this style. Worth trying.","Wildman","Jun 14, 2002"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A highly drinkable beer.  Crisp mouthfeel with a nice hop presence.  The hops aren't overdone at all, but aren't weak either.  Reminded me of Euro-lagers.  As the song says..."...all the little chicks with the crimson lips, say Cleveland rocks!"","proc","Apr 02, 2002"
4.45,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Notes: This is the stuff! A top notch US brewed lager with several awards to back it up ... comparable if not better than some of its German counterparts. If you see buy it ... any macro to micro drinker with thoroughly enjoy this brew. Goes great with a roast beef on rye at lunch time! Fact: Its their flagship brew.","Jason","Mar 31, 2002"
