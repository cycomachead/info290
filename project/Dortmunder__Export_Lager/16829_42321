4,8.1,,,,,,"I really like german lagers. I think only germans can do real good lagers. I don't know how they do it, but they do it. And this beer is a good thing of german beer, I can call it a classic of german brewing. This beer has an amber color, good foam, and really rich malt aroma. The taste of this beer is malt, only malt with no hops on finish. It's not too sweet, it's medium malty taste. The people who love lagers I can recommend this pale german lager, it's really tasty.","vanderSchorpioen","Oct 09, 2014"

3.63,-1.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.75,"500ml bottle. Pokal glass. Golden color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, close crown. Fairly good retention & lacing on sides. Crispy upfront displays grainy, herbal & sweet flavors. Medium to light body. Moderate to medium high carbonation. Dense & velvety mouthfeel with spicy touch. Clean bitterness arises in the middle but maltiness drives into an extended sweet/bitter followed by light estery â€“pear & apple- aftertaste where slight metallic hues are shown.","GONZALOYANNA","Oct 25, 2013"

3.41,-7.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Very pale straw colour. The initial head dissipates rapidly to a thin overall lacing. There is no discernible smell to my nose. Dry but mild Helles type flavour, which belies it's 5.3% ABV. Goes down nicely, and would probably be an ideal tipple out in the tropics - refreshingly dry and subtle, but carrying a satisfying oomph in the background too.","JonnoWillsteed","May 01, 2012"

2.6,-29.7,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"500 ml bottle. Golden colour, with a rather normal head that fades quickly. Smells of damp earth, grains, some citrus hints. Light body, thin palate and an anodine palate of malt and almost nothing. It's about to expire, so another taste is maybe needed.","janubio","Nov 21, 2011"

3.85,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Half litre flip top, very pale colour, very clear. Lots of foam which goes quickly. Grassy smell, notes of citrus. As for taste its on the sweetside, grassy, slight hint of bitterness at the end. Easy enough to drink. What I like about this beer is you can drink several and unlike north german pils type beers it doesn't dry your mouth out.","jonb5","Sep 05, 2009"
4.2,13.5,4,4,4,5,4.5,"Drinkability is another high point. Light, refreshing, tart, and carbonated well. A mid-range ABV also serves to boost this factor. NOt sure if this is a Pilsner, but makes a damn fine Helles. Really fantastic, in quality, freshness, and overall enjoyability.","czfreeman","Apr 25, 2008"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a well balanced helles and went down very well in all. I taste a mixture of mild hops and barley and nothing much else. This beer is easy drinking and slightly reminiscent of their other beers. Maybe the yeast they use? Of course Aktien Zwickl an dLAndbier a better but that s due to differences in style so right on!","DerBayer","Beers"
3.8,2.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a huge, dense, off-white head leaves some strands of lace. One-dimensional aroma is full of pungeant spicy hops.. Clear golden beer holds a few streams of lazily rising bubbles. Flavor a mildly sweet pale malt and white grapes mixed with grassy/spicy hops. It finishes with a mild bitter bite. The body is average and the beer is low in carbonation making for a soft watery mouthfeel. It's not as crisp as most Helles, and I'd say it's somewhere between a Helles and Kellerbier in flavor. Not a bad beer. Try one if you're in the area.","HappyHourHero","0"
