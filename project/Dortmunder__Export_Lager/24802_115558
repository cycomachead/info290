4.24,5.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall: One of the best US brewed Dortmunders I've had and one I very, very highly recommend. Fantastic brew here. This is what craft lager is all about.","Beric","Jan 20, 2015"
3.79,-5.7,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Slightly hazy deep golden color with a huge frothy white head. Huge pilsner malt aroma with a touch of green apple and spicy floral hops. Bready crakery sweet maltiness with a solid shop of spicy earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a silky bubbly mouthfeel. This is a very nice beer, I miss the malt depth that one gets from the German versions. Very drinkable lager.","johnnnniee","Jan 13, 2015"
4.35,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to pound down for a long time and definitely the best beer I’ve had in the style.","TheManiacalOne","Dec 30, 2014"
4.33,7.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Overall quite nice, a well done lager, soft and juicy while nice malt profile, mixed with great hops that do tend to get a little too bitter on the back end but that's nitpicking. Still a well done enjoyable lager. Webster brewery should learn from these guys.","jlindros","Dec 21, 2014"

4.05,0.7,,,,,,"Bottle. Shockingly the first Dortmunder I have reviewed. I have had he stlye before and enjoy it. This beer poured a clear, filtered, coppery color. Modest head. Aroma is very cereally. Lager yeast and herbal, grassy hops. Simple but enticing. The flavor really delivers cereal flavor's. Very grainy. Hops are interesting; tea like and grassy. Light caramel. Crisp Lager yeast. Very agreeable and well made. Lighter bodied. Great carbonation and crisp feel. I would like a few more interpretations of the style easily available to me. Well done.","VelvetExtract","Jun 16, 2014"

4.28,6.5,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a dark gold body with a creamy head. Nice crisp aroma balanced with subtle hops. Flavor is real nice. Bite of minerals, sea salts, orange zest, earthy hops, really explodes with flavor from the first sip. Refreshing tempered with moderate bitterness. Really enjoyed this one.","papat444","Apr 05, 2014"

3.97,-1.2,4.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"The beer pours a beautiful, golden sunburst color, with a nice huge head of creamy white, pebble-like bubbles that sit about a fingers width above the glass. In body, the beer is crystal clear and clean and a nice lazy stream of bubbles working their way from the glasses bottom. On the nose, the beer smells like a German lager. Grassy noble hops meld with smooth cracker malts, a touch of earthy loam and a very soft note of DMS that gives the nose a touch of meatiness. On the tongue, the beer tastes bready sweet upfront, but quickly begins to blend with nice grassy bitters that lead to a dryer finish. Acidity is soft, but slightly citric in the mouth, adding a pop to the sip, and the earthiness of the malt mixed with the light DMS flavors adds a nice salty finish that just makes me crave another sip. In flavor, the beer begins as smooth cracker/pilsner malt flavors that blends with fresh cut grassy bitters, subtle mineral notes, and very faint touches of vegetal corn. The finish is salty with a nice background of more herbal hop bitters, and even a touch of lemongrass and citrus and bread. At times, I get a burst of lemon bread in the finish, which I really like. The malt makes a resurgence into the aftertaste with a nice, warm bread flavor that blends with the slightly vegetal flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels on medium in body with a fresh crispness that allows for supreme drinkability. Carbonation is middling, and just a touch rough, though I do like the prickle on my tongue. Once the beer leaves, the mouth is left with some saliva on the edges of the tongue, but an overall dry sense from the saltiness that hits on the finish of the beer. Overall, this is yet another beautiful, nearly sessionable lager from Idle Hands. The only thing I have against it is that the saltiness becomes a bit much as I drink more and more of the beer. I almost wish they would bring out the subtle citrus notes a little more from the hops, just to dumb down the saltiness a little. I actually found myself thirsty after I finished the beer… This beer is tremendously drinkable, however, even with its saltiness, and very tasty and complex for such a drinkable beer. Much like Idle Hands other lager, I’m getting new flavors with each sip. American craft beer is only just starting to mine the incredible complexity and versatility of German lagers, and Idle Hands is at the forefront of this movement in New England. Another great fresh lager beer.","Maxwell","0"
