3.84,7.9,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"A standard (in the good way) German lager - you are immersed in everything (all four of them) that goes into making it. Pleasantly malty, though maybe lacking a bit overall in the crisp, biscuity department. At any rate, flavourful, simple, and pretty easy to put back, not to mention that the standard price (sub 4 bucks) for a German-made lager or weissbier applies here as well.","biboergosum","Mar 01, 2010"

It's not the best representation of the style, but the flavors are unique and it's a perfect beer for grilling out or chilling out on a summery day. Now if those days would only get here. I'll have to see if I can grab some more Urfass this summer.","feelmefoam","Jul 21, 2008"
3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The drink is surprisingly substantial and on the full side of medium-bodied. Nicely carbonated with great drinkability.","cvstrickland","May 22, 2008"

4.1,15.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Straw yellow color with tons of carbonation bubbles. The head has great retention. The aroma is classic German pilsner. Soft grains and spicy grass/hay like hop. The taste is classic as well. Spicy hops dominates the lager while a nice touch of grain and malt balance out the beer. Finishes clean and slightly spicy. I enjoyed this beer. One of the best pilsners I have had in a while.","Luigi","Nov 26, 2004"
3.65,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear light golden with a thin white head that is well sustained,lightly skunked aroma from the green bottle but a light toastiness comes thru along with some fresh mowed grass (would love to smell fresh)a nice mix of toasted malt and hop.Taste has a sharp hoppy edge to it,a a lightly toasted malt backbone holds up well to the big dose of spicey/sharp hops,as like many German lagers there is also a faint note of iron coming thru.A well rounded German lager I wish I could try fresh even an older bottle shows some nice lager qualities.","oberon","Beers"
