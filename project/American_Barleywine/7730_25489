I don't really care about how many fingers and color etc...I care about the taste. I must say for an IPA the 2 Captains (also a Nøgne) is closer to the mark for an IPA, however this beer is so awesome I can't help but rate it high. The nose is almost non existent, even in a large wine glass, but the mouth feel is awesome, the bittering and flavoring hops are fantastic! I can't help but wonder what would happen if a huge pile of the right hops where added to this recipe in the last few minutes of the boil. It reminds me of the Dog fish head IPA line, but better. Bravo again. Too bad Nøgne has been sold to a big player. or...maybe not too bad.","jwikan","Nov 03, 2013"

Bitterness stands its ground against the malt blitz. Hops are earthy, spicy, and freshly bitter. A hint of fruit from the yeast softens the thick flavors. Nice dryness keeps it super-drinkable.

I'm not typically a big fan, but this one has awesome balance. Very complex with hints of rye, tangerines, caramel, hop resin, pine, brown sugar, and dark fruit. It's big and bold, but not overdone like most Barleywines. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, but creamy at the same time. This is probably the best Barleywine I've ever had.

All balanced with crisp, citric hops that pucker the tongue and give off a dry finish (that is also complemented by a cameo from the alochol to warm you up). Easy to drink, relaxing, and a well-balanced brew that is one of the best I've had in a while.","clayrock81","Jan 17, 2012"

Pours cloudy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some incredible thick soapy lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big herbal hops, smokiness, old pine, citrus, caramel, wood, dark fruit, chocolate, light coffee, and spiciness. I have a feeling this is an older bottle. Extremely interesting smelling, and not like fresh hops at all. Taste of big caramel, wood, herbal, molasses, chocolate, biscuit, pine, light citrus, and spicy hops. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of herbal hops, caramel, chocolate, wood, molasses, and pine on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that drinks easily for being 10%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish. Overall this is a very nice enjoyable barleywine. Aromas are a bit odd, but it had nice flavor and balance. I would like to pick up a younger bottle in the future.","superspak","Dec 23, 2011"

Definitely a hop-forward barley wine in the American mold, but there's enough malt flavour and complexity to balance things out. Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied, sticky sweet, gooey syrup-like middle with a dryly bitter and round hop finish that coats the mouth. Some warmth kicks in after a few sips.

Nose is assertively hoppy in the forefront with some sugary malt in the background and a boozy alcohol/medicinal quality at the back..

Mouthfeel is medium-light, subtly carbonated and slightly creamy. Solid example of the style.

This is such a solid beer overall, and everything they do is quality, that it's hard to find something to pick on at all.

Carbonation is low as it should be and for a 10% beer and a barley wine its not nearly as warming as I thought it'd be. For a barley wine this is an easy drinker, though I'm not sure that is what I really want when it comes to the style, I want something that demands sipping. I mean this doesn't demand sipping, it doesn't encourage quaffing either, but I think it goes down "too easily" for a barleywine. Body is slick and full and leaves some alcohol on the palate after being swallowed. Good beer, but not great. Give it a shot, but I'm still a much bigger fan of Old Guardian. Very good, but should not be almost ten dollars for a single, then again its an import so I'll deal...I love everything else I've had from Nogne-O and I like this one too.

The nose is predominantly chocolate malt backed by some bitter coffee notes and a little dark fruitiness. A kiss of piney hp action is also present. On the palate it has very low carbonation leaving the huge alcoholic bitterness to kick you in the mouth. It's pretty smooth once you get used to it.

Very odd. Aroma is somehwat bitter but mostly is dominated by deep, dark malt (chocolate mostly). This carries Into the flavor - very unbalanced with strong malt presence and some dry bitterness. The chocolate malt doesn't mix well with what other flavors are present. Mouth is standard and probably the best part of the drink - moderate body with a good level of carbonation. All around I just can't get over the flavor. I don't think this bottle is spoiled or such, but it's just way too much malt for a barleywine.","BirdFlu","Oct 13, 2009"

It also starts sweet but dies pretty quickly, and leaves a nice bittering on the finish, with the creamy chocolate roasted goodness. I don't remember how much it costs, but I would be very inclined to get it again!

4.02,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"My first Nogne brew, and highly anticipated. Very deep brown, bordering on black in color. A flurry of carbonation results in a bubbly, medium-sized tan head that has great retention. When it finally fades, a constellation of little dots surround the middle of the snifter, and a few clumps of bubbles are left on top of the brew. Smells pleasant with deep chocolates and ripe red cherries easing into some piny hops. Subtle sweet malts and dark dried fruits flow across the palate and are followed by a big hit of more piney hops, distant dark chocolates and fairly sharp and lingering alcohol heat. Mouth-feel is medium to heavy, and it initially goes down smooth and creamy, but a certain crispness forms around the edges after a few drinks, making things interesting. I can see where aging one of these would make a big difference in rounding off some of the sharp edges, but it's still good to go as is, and very satisfying.","stephens101","Jun 02, 2009"

Looks just like a stout, it's black with a big tan head with great lacing and retention. Just no evidence of barleywine in the appearance. The smell is really incredible. There's a lot of sweetness underneath, I can imagine there being a lot more hoppiness in the smell when this was fresh, but there is still a clear, crisp hop smell. Kind of floral and spicy with a bit of citrus in the smell. There is still a slight smell of dark malts, which is a bit uncharacteristic, but I can forgive it for the rest of the smell. (I feel a bit self-contradictory now). The taste is great at this age. Very smooth and sweet, almost creamy. There a good deep, dark fruity character to it, with just a tiny bit of caramel, and I even get a good rush of bitterness. The creaminess is really the shining moment, making the mouthfeel perfect. There is almost no alcohol presence or hotness. I found myself constantly reaching to have more of this. And it was gone quickly. I feel bad as I post this for the first score, but I think it's appropriate, considering the style. But barleywine might be the best category, and I wouldn't suggest dialing it down as it might miss out on some of the rest of the high points.

The taste started a little sweet and then a nice bitter woody hop bite, the malt was kind of like a rye beer, that may have been from the hops but I was tasting rye. It is a little on the light side for a barleywine, but still nice and thick with a good level of carbonation for a 10% ABV beer. The lightness and good carbonation made it very drinkable.","orsulacp","Jul 23, 2008"

The second one I ages for probably 6-7 months (it doesn't need intense aging). Norwegians, despite the fact that their still trying to find their place, know how to make a good brew. The same characteristics from the fresher version hold true to the aged version. Chocolate aroma, light sugary taste, mellow hop flavor. This beer is a good 'chillum' barley wine. It's got all the characteristics of a west coast BW, but it's not a punch in the face (like big foot). This beer wants you to relax, but enjoy the flavor full on. I hope this beer shows up more often. It's a keeper.","100floods","Jul 22, 2008"

Travis says it's got a very clean flavor, and he's right. It's a pretty dry barleywine flavor, sweet for a second, but with a very bitter lingering hop finish that I found unpleasant.

Aroma is dark grains, fresh green hops, and alcohol. Taste starts with a glimpse of maltiness, which becomes all about the hops from then on, with some alcohol presence noted at the close and beyond.

I was definitely not going to let # 100 Barley Wine-Style Ale pass me by. Slender 500 ml. bottle, with a starkly attractive label style. The pour looked quite dark for a barleywine, while the head was three fingers tall and foamy. The smell was quite sweet and had me recall raisins, toffee, and cocoa, The taste was not typical of the style, as the malts felt very roasty and astringent. The bitterness was quite brazing as a result of the bone dry nature of the beer. The chocolate, roasted nuts, and smoke in the taste screamed Imperial Porter to me. A big blast of oak notes in the finish had me wondering whether this was barrel aged before bottling.

4.17,3.5,4.5,5,4,4,3.5,"(Bottle conditioned, 500 ml. Courtesy of Erik Dahl, Venner av Nøgne Ø.) I received this remarkable beer with awe, mixed with great anticipation. Very few litres of #100 have been for sale to the public. Would I like it, or would the massive hops (80 IBU!) be too much for me? The cost of brewing it (= the massive amount of malts and hops required for a batch) made the brewers certain that it would be unprofitable as a permanent brew, particularly with Norwegian alcohol taxes. This impenetrable cloudy dark brown beer pours with a large to moderate tan head. Aroma is simply wonderful - Colombus hops galore, dark chocolate, leather, cigars, pipe tobacco, tar. The complexity remains in the flavour - extremely malty, very sweet, but also extremely bitter. The bitterness (which becomes medicinal and wormwood-like in the aftertaste) prevents me from giving this beer a full score. On a regular basis, Id prefer Nøgne Øs God Jul (which is world class this year, IMHO) and also their Porter. But what a great experiment #100 is!","Sigmund","Apr 03, 2007"

Body has real creamy texture with medium carbonation and no alcohol could be detected. If I had to rate to style, then Im not sure this would score very highly since it is quite off for the style.
