2.76,-30.8,1.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Once the massive head settled to a reasonable level, the liquid below it was a dull chestnut brown color, with a gooey murkiness to it. In the nose, phenols and some herbal bitterness, lesser notes of caramel and yeast. The taste was definitely weird and off, but I actually didn't think it was completely undrinkable. There were flavors of caramel and bready (bretty?) yeast, cooking sherry, and actually lots of herbal hops. Not very good, and possibly infected, but as I said, I didn't find it undrinkable, surprisingly. Did I go back for more after my little sampler? Nope. Light-medium body and pretty thinned out in the mouthfeel. Overall, this beer was a huge mess, and not at all what I like in my barleywines.","Rifugium","May 12, 2014"

4.1,2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottle 2843/3240. Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, tangerine, orange zest, floral, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, light clove, brown sugar, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and good strength. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, tangerine, orange zest, floral, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, clove, light pine, brown sugar, and toasted earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pear, apple, orange zest, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, clove, brown sugar, and light pine on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt and barrel flavors with a moderate amount of hops; with a great malt/hop/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barleywine style. All around great balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 11, 2013"

3.99,0,4,4.25,4,3.25,4,"750ml corked and caged bottle. 2011 vintage served in a tasting glass. Bottle opened with a pop. Pours a hazy amber-mahogany hue with a fluffy, 1/2 inch, cream-colored head that settles into a consistent, frothy skim. Nose expresses citrus, cotton candy and some vanilla notes. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some toffee flavors as well as some ethanol. Unfortunately, the mouthfeel on this beer kills it for me - way too much carbonation first off; however, once you get past that, it comes off somewhat thin and slightly oily. Overall, a very good example of the style - I have a second bottle, so I'll have to see what 3-5 years does for this beer. Hopefully it will dissipate the carbonation.","Jwale73","May 07, 2013"

Aroma is yeast, malt, dark ripe fruit, burnt sugar. Flavor's much like nose with bittersweet malt balanced very nicely with perfect carbonic tang. Body is perhaps the best I've ever had for a barley wine and despite its power, is quite drinkable with mouth filling textures accented by aggresive appropriate carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of average length, a little boozy, and tasty. Gracias por esta Paulo!!","drpimento","Sep 14, 2012"

Big dark fruit notes on the nose - raisin and currant. Toffee and caramel notes are at the forefront too, but the dryness allows the hops to stand firm. Balancing herbal flavors with a smooth bitterness. Complementary fruit from yeast adds a nice depth of flavor.","bump8628","May 28, 2012"

So immacualtly complex. Nothing subtle about this beast at all. Rich toffee and oak flavors are all over the place.

Sweet, but not excessively so from a slight hop balance. Mouthfeel is relatively large with a light carbonation. Seems right for the style.

Caramel and toffee maltiness up front, alcohol soaked dark fruits in the middle, and barrel in the finish.

4.28,7.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D: Entirely too easy to drink, this goes down dangerously easy. Excellent flavors and a nice balance of oak, whiskey, and malt. This is a very well made beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. If I get the chance to try this again I definitely will. Highly recommended.","pokesbeerdude","Nov 30, 2009"

4.15,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a well balanced, more-ish barleywine. Nice woodiness and vanilla from the barrels, very faint hints of bourbon, still a faint hop bite in the finish, raisins, plums, candied sugar, caramel, light alcohol burn in the finish as well. The only downfall on this one is the body which is a little light, almost watery, for a barleywine. Makes it more drinkable perhaps but you might want a little more bulk to brink out some of the flavors. As is, pretty drinkable - don't worry about opening the bottle by yourself!","ritzkiss","Nov 21, 2009"

3.96,-0.8,5,4,4,4,3.5,"D - The alcohol isn't all that well hidden - I thought this was more than 8.75%. The tannic bite in the finish also makes it a little hard to drink a lot.","MasterSki","Sep 16, 2009"
3.53,-11.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours clear deep copper with thin tan head. The modest aroma has notes of prunes, figs and sweet crystal malts. The taste starts rich and sweet with malt, fig raisin and plum sweetness. Midway and to the finish alcohol chemical notes show up along with a layer of pine hop bitterness. Could use some more age to mellow a bit. It does have a mildly drying malt roastiness into the finish.","BigMcLargeHuge","Jul 19, 2009"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"D- Not as good as the Schlafly Oak Aged BW but well worth drinking, especially if you can find it.","brownbeer","May 30, 2009"
4.83,21.1,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Poured into a chalice a very nice amber color, very nice carbonation, this brew has probably the nicest head from a BWSA to date for me, huge two-finger plus creamy, thick light tan head, with tons of thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop, slightly fruity (figs, plums, raisins), oaky. The taste is awesome, malty, with some hop notes, very nice touch of dark fruits and oak/bourbon. Medium body, goes down pretty smooth, ABV hidden very well (which is not high), but easy drinking. Very drinkable, really enjoying this one today, highly recommended.","Wasatch","May 06, 2009"

4.13,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"A pleasant suprise for sure, I liked the integration between the barrel notes and regular Barleywine flavors in this. While still a bit warm and a steady sipper, I'd love to see how this one would mellow and age over a couple of years.","Kegatron","Apr 08, 2009"
3.88,-2.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this was a very boozy barlywine. Way different from the previous two I had, which were very hoppy. If you can find this, it is worth a shot, but have some good buddies to share it with.","mothman","Mar 31, 2009"
4.08,2.3,5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Somwhat easy to drink, although the taste of the alcohol might get a bit overwhelming if a lot has been drank. Overall a very good beer, worth the $$ for the experience.","ThePeskyDingo","Mar 17, 2009"

4.08,2.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The appearance on this naturally carbonated beauty is great. Large, frothy long lasting head that forms fun shapes. Deep amber color. Nose is light, but shows trace amounts of whiskey, wood and malt. Flavor is heavily sweet, rich, deeply malty, with notes of caramel and toffee. A touch of vanilla and graham from the wood. A lot to like here. Could have more depth and concentration, but is nicely balanced for the style, rich and even has a nice finish. The bottle conditioning makes the difference.","Crosling","Jan 23, 2009"
