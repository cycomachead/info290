Aromas of raw honey, chocolate, molasses, rich toffee, booze, and earthy notes. Flavors are rich and smooth forward, with toffee and molasses sweetness. Creme highlights and earthy notes blend to help balance the booze. Date, fig, and raisins round out the rich characteristics. Smooth, creamy, robust bodied, with a rich, layered, sugary sweets, old world fruit aftertaste. The finish is smooth, creamy, and warming, with a molasses and cream linger.","GarthDanielson","Dec 27, 2014"

Taste isn't AWFUL but it's certainly not good.  A weird plastic-y aspect to this that doesn't sit well.  And still looking at it is giving me the willies.

4.1,-1.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Big crack upon opening, very highly carbonated. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy ruby red color with a 2-3 finger foamy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, citrus rind, pine, pepper, floral, grass, caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, honey, herbal, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, honey, floral, grass, pine, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest/rind, pine, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, honey, floral, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops with dark malt/honey flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barleywine. All around great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

3.75,-9.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"my first beer from this fabled brewery. it is the 2011 vintage, and marked 11% abv on the 12oz. bottle. its hazy and caramel colored, dense looking, and showing less than an inch of white lazy froth. i smell a ton of toffee, sweet english malt and ale yeast, not dissimilar from so many other traditional barleywines. thick and syrupy is the feel, but the alcohol is impressively well hidden, perhaps this beers biggest surprise. its clearly malt forward, sweet enough for any palate, and grounded in an earthy brown butter cream type of desserty vibe that makes it a less than perfect preprandial libation, but which showcases a richness and simultaneous delicacy that really work. better when its warm, and still tame on the alcohol front, this is a well done beer, but probably not the best barleywine ive ever had, which i sort fo expected it to be given the hype on this brewery, or at least a few of its beers. happy with it, not overjoyed.","StonedTrippin","Dec 26, 2013"

Big caramel malt upfront, toffee, and grainy biscuit accents. Finishes semi-dry with pine sap and caramel coated grapefruit and citrus rind bitterness. Moderate carbonation, big full, silky yet syrupy body. Slight creaminess on the finish. An excellent American barleywine.

The nose is a lovely blend of gentle hops, lush caramel and vanilla, and a decent malt background. I also detect some dark fruit. Plums, figs, and such. The taste is lovely as well. All of the aforementioned scents are detectable on the palate. A nice conversion from nose to mouth. This has just a shade of sweetness to it. The only drawback, is that this is one boozy motherfucker. That 11.5% is front and center. The mouthfeel is decent, but again highlights the booziness. Otherwise it's quite smooth with little to no lingering aftertaste.

3.89,-6.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a light to medium bodied pure copper in color with no head or lacing. The aromas are incredibly malty, featuring plenty of caramel, toffee, and sweet dried fruits with a citrusy faded hop character. It solid and to he expected from an '08. The flavors are very sweet and fruity. It's near all swerve malts. I get a lot of cherry and orange peel in the malt bill. It solid and has nice flavor. It's drinkable for the abv and is sticky yet not overly so. Overall this is a nice aged barleywine and pretty similar to the '08 Behemoth that I had earlier this year.","aasher","Dec 23, 2011"
3.95,-5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured out as a deep golden brown color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer was pretty strong smelling, it had a lot of malts and hops in there and a heavy boozy aroma too. The taste of the beer has some sweet caramel upfront that shifts into a hoppy bitter finish with a warming alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is heavy, oily and has a light amount of carbonation. Overall this is a big beer, I'm excited to try it again one day. Possibly have it again after aging it for a little.","Knapp85","Dec 23, 2011"

What I did get had a thick, creamy, foamy, frothy, fluffy, billowy light tan head that lasts all the way down and some lace. Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is yeast, caramel, toffee, hops, honey, fresh leather. Flavor is like nose but with sweet and bitter standing out most with enough tang to balance and then other flavors too fleeting for me to identify. Soft full, round body and excellent carbonation. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, and only a hint of alcohol.","drpimento","Nov 01, 2011"

On th bottle it says there's honey from mt. Hood which I instantly thought was kind of a bs thing because usually honey just gets all fermented out and all the honey flavors are gone but not with this guy. It's very rich and complex, a nice finish with lots of lingering sweetness.","kingcrowing","Oct 03, 2011"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a medium to full bodied brew with an excessive amount of carbonation that is just way over the top. The sheer amount of yeast and carbonation that makes its way into the glass is quite distracting. However, for how over carbonated it was, instead of being prickly and bubblly inside the mouth, the overkill of yeast made it feel more thick and creamy, strange. As-is this was a solid take on the style, I hope my experience was just an off bottle or bad batch because I see this without the carbonation and yeast issue being a very solid brew. I will need to revisit this soon but let my review be a warning. I feel that my bottle literally could have burst if it was mishandled, there was that much carbonation.","stakem","Sep 30, 2011"

It is much more balanced in the hop department and doesn’t linger into that hazy DIPA/American Barleywine category that most west coast breweries seem to love now (Stone, Green Flash, Sierra Nevada, etc. which are all too heavy on the bittering even with aging). This is perfect after about a year of aging and from what I have read is one of the style which is better consumed in the 6 mo - 1 year range. Highly recommended; I also enjoyed this more than my first 2 HotD beers (Fred and Ruth).","claspada","Jul 22, 2011"

There was an odd flavor combination of strong whiskey mixed with a maple syrup and a touch of mentholated cherry to finish off the palate. This was still on the boozy side even with the age.

That said, this stuff pours a very lightly murky russet-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit, pine, mild menthol, and toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, though the toffee is much more pronounced, giving some more balance to the proceedings, and the alcohol stabs through quickly, smartly, and shortly. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and an oily feel. Overall, a very nice barleywine, a nice side-by-side with the thicker and maltier Fred from the Wood. Good times.","TMoney2591","Apr 17, 2011"

This 5-year old bottle is incredibly smooth and delicious.  The hop bitterness has mellowed a lot but hasn't disappeared.  The honey sweetness is still present. The mouthfeel is sublime.

Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured red-orange with a three finger off-white head that subsided to two fingers very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and sweet fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus hop, citrus, caramel, and orange zest. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. I had been hearing lots about this one and I knew once I saw it on the shelf in Cali, I had to have it. The citrus presence in this one was nuts, and quite enjoyable. 11%!?!?

Color is a nasty looking cloudy brown with lots of sediment floating around and a 3 finger thick light tan head that lingers. Smell is a good balance of sugary malt and alcohol, some simcoe hop bitterness, slightly metallic astringent quality, the amarillo is totally overpowered. Taste is very sweet up front, lots of sweet cherries and dark fruits, caramel malt, some fruity hops, slightly piney, some alcohol. Mouthfeel is a bit light for a barleywine with a medium carbonation - way off for the style, the alcohol seems to have thinned it out. Warm alcohol finish.

But this is Doggie Claws' true beauty - it's all of these things in the most excessive way that it can be, and yet it still works. It represents a world where America, Russia, and China have all evolved as equally capable, war-hungry superpowers, and yet despite irreconcilable differences, the world is somehow a better place.","SirRuss","0"

There is also a decent amount if citrus flavor especially grapefrut and orange peel. This is again countered mid-palate by a prominent earthy, leathery malt presence.

The hop notes are unique, but all told they're pretty mild (I know this bottle is a year old, but the hops in Old Guardian, for example, have a lot more to say after a year than those of Doggie Claws).

Taste has a ton of hops still but the flavor now blends well into the sweet maltiness and the crisp, piney hop bitterness has dulled. Taste is very sweet. Chewy toffee and caramel. Alcohol is definitely present but not as prevalent as fresh. This could easily go several more years. The strong taste mixed with the potent smell consumes your senses and really draws you in.

The caps must not be attached well, because the beer is still. This is not the only bottle in the case to turn out flat, either. Strange, because an earlier Doggie Claws -- 2003 -- was extremely bubbly, so much that the brewery sold cases at a hefty discount for several years afterward. It kept building up fizziness in the bottle. And it was a great beer! Champagne-like in its color and delicate flavor, once you waited for the head to die down. But there is no way to let the head "die up" on the newer one. It tasted good when fresh, but aging is supposed to benefit it. Well....It's a copper-colored, flat, sweet, strong drink. Sort of like an off--brand sherry. It might be good for cooking, except for all the hops. Really a shame because I usually like this brewery and love this beer.","chezztone","0"

But still a very strong almost whiskey smell. It tasted very stong of alchohol as well, and very sweet with a strong after taste.

Aroma is an intense burst of pungent American hops, fruity malt (pears, raisins, dates), brown sugar/caramel, and some cinnamon or nutmeg. Smells like a richer version of SN Bigfoot. Flavors are similar and equally big, but incredibly smooth for a barleywine this young. This one tastes like it already has several years under its belt, with a balance between malty dark fruit and hop bitterness. After about eight months in the bottle, the specific Amarillo and Simcoe flavors and aromas are gone, but their smooth bittering properties are hanging in there. Drinkability is truly exceptional for a beer this big; aside from a very slight dry/warm alcohol in the finish, you wouldn't guess this one is almost 12%. Mouthfeel is also solid for the style; it could actually be stickier/more viscous for my tastes.","trill","Aug 14, 2008"

Smooth caramel apple sweetness up front with a drying wood flavor midway. The label says simcoe and amarillo hops were used, but the year + of aging has seemd to quiet these down a bit.

Taste is basically the reverse of the aroma. A big rich and sweet maltiness hits up front, very sweet caramel and raisin flavors. The citrusy hops come in middle to end of the taste and blend and balance the sweetness and linger with the richness into the aftertaste. Soft and full bodied, yet not overly cloying, a nice hoppy dryness in the finish. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable, incredibly balanced for its strength.

There's a ton of caramel, malt, and toffee, but my nose was still hit first with a big burst of hops - piney and a bit powdery. The texture is like oil as it hits the palate, heavy and with fairly low carbonation. Lots of malt sweetness, but the hops still hold up here as well. The hop character is quite resinous with a bit of grapefruit that provides depth. By the mid, there's a rich fruitiness that appears. By the finish, alcohol has taken over the show and the warmth lingers for quite some time, accompanied by flashbacks of caramel and pine. A little sticky, but the mouthfeel is definitely appropriate for such a big beer. I can't imagine what this would have been like fresh - either a disaster or an epiphany.

Deep, grassy, citrus aromatics dominate with only a hint of caramelly malt nose and an earthy spice. The flavor has a strong caramel malt and resiny hop blend, which hides the alcohol well for a barleywine. There is a slight astringency and moderate lingering bitterness. This brew is still very hop focused overall. Mouthfeel is quite foamy and medium thick. Quite quaffable as it's not overpowering for the style.

The carbonation levels are a turn off, but settle down to a dull roar after a half hour or so. I'd recommend this one fairly warm, as the malt gains some control and the carbonation seems to settle down quicker. My (circa early 1800's stone walled and dirt floored) cellar perhaps isn't the best place to age beers, as the temperature fluctuates, and I'd expect this could be kept better.

Pretty thin, body, and the taste is a little more understated than what I was expecting, but still a very nice hop presence, I'd say sweetly piney with ...

Although young, this barleywine is loaded with complexity, and I wish I had many more than this single bottle to savor over time. Taste is a curious blend of fruity and herbal hops up front, late harvest grapes mingling with sharper pine. Youre soon transported to a sweet caramel malty playground with just a bit of bread popping up in the toaster. Finish brings out a bit of spice, warm alcohol, and a fresh, sweet hoppy finish.

It is a deep, dark, rich rubied brown. The second phrase is an understatement. This is a truly hoppy beer; the aroma literally fills the room and my fingers feel sticky from handling the bottle and glass. The head is deliriously high and potent, and the beer goes down thick like candied sugar, only to be brutally scraped away by the severity of the antiseptic hops. My lips are wintry-chapped today, and it smarts to pour this hop beast across them. I would say yes, this is a barley wine; it has the thick viscosity and austere malt wood-varnish quality I find in many US barley wines but not too many IPAx2's. It's incredibly hoppy, though, and delightful for that. It's not as bright and flowery as Bigfoot, but the Simcoe hops (god I love them) lend an earthy complexity and taut suppleness that makes this a damn enjoyable bevvy. Aging should suit this beer just fine, but don't you want to try it now and get spanked by the violent hops? Admit it, bitch, you do. You do.

Aroma was the wackiest element...initially it seemed like dark fruit would win the day, but several deep whiffs later, I noticed an acrid note. Some finishing pine tree aromas later led me to think: acrid = someone pee'd on a pine tree. Sorry, but I gotta call 'em as I drink 'em.

The flavor is mildly sweet toasty malt. The alcohol is camoflaged very well. The body and flavor are just thinner than what I expect from a barleywine. Im used to that thick, old fruit flavor from barleywines instead of this relatively crisp, just hoppy enough for balance flavor that has really held up amazingly well since 2002.

However, as I let it warm, some sweetness came out a bit and I got the flavor of some molasses (not sure if this is what I really tasted, but an idea), but stayed pretty peppery as well. I have had many barleywine styles but this was very different than most others and was not nearly as sweet as other I have had in the past.

The beer itself was a hazy but vibrant orange-amber hue. The delicate nose was well composed, consisting of roasty candy malt with notes of orange peel and lime, and a tinge of alcohol. I found the taste to be problematic. While the flavor profile was characteristic of the style, it was lacking in strength and finish. I did enjoy the sweetness level, which was on the low end. Perhaps poor aging conditions overly subdued the big roasty flavors and the equally hoppy bitter finish that I look for in barley wines. The mouth feel was OK, but felt a little thin in the finish.

Aroma is nice and hoppy with a nice array of pine needles, herbs, spice, and resin with a nice roasty caramel malted backing. Has a certain sweet tone with some citrusy grapefruit peels too.

4.23,1.7,2.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"2002 Edition. WOW! If not for the overly enthusiastic bubbly head, this might be a top ten beer. It pours a brassy/copper with a BIG rocky off-white head. A really floral whole hop aroma is very reminiscent of whole fresh cannabis buds (not that I would know). The substantial malt body houses a very potent hop bitterness. Grapefruit, orange peel and a fairly strong camphor astringency, (made up word?) blend and mix with a cherry liquor flavor, along with spices and lots of warming alcohol. A faint dark chocolate flavor finishes this complex and tasty seasonal offering. Unfiltered!","BeerResearcher","Aug 20, 2003"

3.88,-6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Doggie claws in the woods was available at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Light brown color. A medium bodied barleywine ale. Malty with a fairly strong alcohol overtone. Citrus and orange flavor. Complex undertones. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty.","beerguy101","Jul 21, 2003"

4.13,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"ooo, this is a lovely one. Big, choppy seafoam head. Cloudy, orange beer. Looks like quite a meal. Smells good. A little like sweet cherries. This beer tastes very robust and full-bodied. The alcohol is apparent, but it still tastes very good. Pleasant mouthfeel and very, very drinkable for the style and abv. I'll be looking for this on tap.","dwarbi","May 11, 2003"
4.08,-1.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Great beer. I could have done without quite as much fluffiness in my barleywine, but offsetting the standard 90 weight viscosity of other beers in this genre was a welcome change of pace. I was impressed.","TXHops","Apr 21, 2003"
4.62,11.1,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,5,"2002 version. Tremendously thick, off white, inpenetrable, virtually static, mountainous head leaves intricate lace. Hop polyphenol laden hazy, peachy light bronze hue. Pungent wafts of ripe, juicy mango and pseudosweet clementine like hop oils with a resiny pine contrast. Subdued medium lovibond caramel malt adds a sweet, mildly toffeeish component. Subversive, ominous ethanol sear is discernible with concentration. Intense and appetizing in aroma. The flavor begins transiently balanced, but citrus laced hop bitterness dominates after a brief deliberation. Caramel malt struggles to assert itself, but does manage token, candyish sweetness. Malt balance is nearly acheived, however, mostly due to the ample residual sugars and dextrins from the high original gravity. Hop flavor emerges in earnest mid palate once the caramel malt presence is forgotten, and is akin to sugar dusted grapefruit albeit with round, floral and melon like notes. Moderate in body, and dangerously soft and crisply dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes with a snap of biscuit yielding to continuing, satiating hop bitterness and nearly forgotten ethanol warmth. A delicious, hop driven brew with sufficient malt balance. Not quite a barleywine. This is easily the most drinkable double IPA I've had. The hops shine, and the malt backbone is there, but unlike many "barleywines", Doggie Claws sits dangerously light on the palate. Delicious and addictive, if you love brightly hopped brews. Nearly the epitomy of a double IPA. Watch out...","marc77","Mar 30, 2003"
4.35,4.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4," Smells are as confusing as they are complex; Yeasty, phenolic, evergreen and citrus hop aromas along with carmalized sugar and some old Bruin sourness slaps you in the face as you bury your nose in the glass for more. Full bodied, bready malt and flavors of tart grapes and sour cherries get busy with earthy, juicy hops and searing alcohol. Mouthfeels was a little tinny - Im not sure this bottle ( 2002 vin) was treated properly, as the astringency and sour notes were a slight distraction from the rich, malty base and complex hop flavors. Aftertaste is tart fruit, piney hop and the slow burn of alcohol. Very different. Very Hairy.","Shiredave","Mar 26, 2003"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A somewhat nebulous deep copper color, with a Mastiff sized head, spumescent in texture, the color a beautiful light tan and the resultant lace a fine sheet that covers the glass. Nose is hop floral, malt sweet, and a pleasure to sniff, start is thick malt, honey sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate. BAM the hops bite like a great white in a feeding frenzy with the acidity quite delectable and the aftertaste alcohol bitter and long lasting. A must try for Barley Wine Freaks, but if you cant Run with the big dogs, stay on the porch, as this bad boy will take the hide off an Armadillo.","Gusler","Mar 25, 2003"
3.77,-9.4,4.5,5,3,4,3.5,"2002 edition. The first thing I noticed about this beer was the unusual hop aroma  stemming, I suppose, from the rather unusual choice of hops. The scent is mostly herbal, with a bit of an orange, citrusy note. A whiff of alcohol makes its way through too. All this is undergirded by a subtle, caramel malt aroma. The end result is quite terrific, and improves as the beer sits. In appearance, the beer has a light copper color and a formidable creamy head which leaves good lacing down the glass. The flavor struck me a bit harshly. Theres just a tiny hint of sweetness up front, and then its right into a mostly herbal, somewhat medicinal hop-dominated flavor, and a mild alcohol warming, building to what struck me as an extremely bitter finish. Medium bodied and dry, this is a decent beer, and improves when it sits. Id like to set one of these away for a year or so and see how it smooths out.","mzwolinski","Beers"

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Orangish-copper in color with a thick, mountainous head with excellent lacing. The aroma is herbal, alcoholic, fruity, and somewhat bready. The flavor is alcoholic throughout; it attacks the whole mouth. It has a herbal and sweet maltiness like that of candi sugar. It reminds me of a Belgian ale. I even detect a slight fig flavor. It has a pecular smell that I have never smelt before. It must be the choice of hops in this one. It was my first Barley Wine of the year, and I found it to be extremely complex in the aromas and flavors. A very good beer that I would definitely sample again.","BeerBuilder","Dec 19, 2002"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"2002 Bottle: Hoo-yeah, this is a potent beer! Dark murky amber color with an insanely thick off-white head. As with other HOTD beers, this one took awhile to pour. Aroma of hops and pepper resonates throughout the glass. Definitely has some Imperial IPA qualities in the flavor, with strong hops, alcohol, and some fruit. There is enough malt in the flavor and in the finish to balance it out and to make for a nice seasonal Barley Wine.","Dogbrick","Oct 12, 2001"

The one I tried had already been aged for a year and it was great. Bold up front hops without being braceing or brash with substantial malt backing. Sorry about not being more spacific but Allen waited until later in the evening before breaking it out and ... well...you know! I feel sorry for those of you to far away to get some maybe next y","mattmaples","0"
