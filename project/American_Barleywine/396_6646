I have seen and hesitated in buying this and finally bit the bullet because I have been impressed with other Alesmith beers, this one hit nail in the coffin, Kevin approved!

Strangely on this barleywine I smell more of a piney hop aroma than malt. The taste has a strong pine hop edge but there's plenty of malt to back it up. Plenty of interplay between hops and malt going on. The mouth is somewhat sticky,but the drink ability for this barleywine is quite amazing. I notice hop aroma fades as it sits for awhile.","Franziskaner","Jul 06, 2014"

Possible some honey and raisins in there, as well as some toffee and biscuit. The taste is excellent. A slight sweetness, as well as a definite silky texture. Some caramel, raisin, toffee.

4.03,-2.2,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, muddled, opaque, chestnut-brown coloring with a dense, creamy, off-white head that sits low and slowly settles into a sparse, filmy surface coating. Aromas of cedar, peat, cracker and biscuit, toffee, apple, pear, and an overall fruitcake character. Smells balanced, but rich and imposing at the same time. Flavors of toffee and roast on the forward tongue, with hints of chocolate to follow. Apple pie, with all the spices, some subtle tropical fruit notes, and a light caramel highlight. Earthy notes pop in and out on the taste buds, helping to keep everything in some semblance of balance. Very balanced on a mid-bodied feel, which pulls off a lightening effect on the heavy, robust palate. The aftertaste is roasted sweetness, with a blending of all the rich, sugary sweetness together with all of the fruit characteristics, and also the first real hints of booze. A fruity sweet linger at the end, both tangy and slightly cloying, into a slick, slightly bitter, lingering finish. Tasty brew, and I bet it ages nicely.","GarthDanielson","Sep 06, 2013"

Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a small dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Light soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, apple, orange zest, floral, brown sugar, pine, molasses, toast, orange rind, brown bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, orange zest, apple, toast, floral, pine, orange rind, brown sugar, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, orange zest, orange rind, light fruits, toast, light chocolate, brown bread, brown sugar, floral, pine, light roast, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of deep malt and hop flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance, and hardly any cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied with a creamy, slick, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic well aged barleywine. Fantastic complexity and balance of deep malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2013"

This was a very good barleywine, better than most of the competition. It was rich and dark with sweet caramel, molasses and raisin flavors dominating. There was a lot of boozy warmth and very little hop bitterness near the end. Old Numbskull definitely stood out among the crowd as an exceptional barleywine.","Aaron_Ramson","Dec 16, 2012"

A really good fresh barleywine which is not easy to do always. This beer is just missing a little special something to move it into the elite category though. Maybe age would do it -- I doubt I'll ever know as Alesmith is never going to distribute in my neighborhood, but I can always hope and dream though. I bet this is exceptional in its BA form.

Dry, earthy hops up front are somewhat stale/faded but the flavor is still there, adding complexity to this intense beer. Earthy and leathery malt compliment the hops befoe being countered by toffee, fig, raisin and caramel sweetness. There's plenty ofvalcohol sweetness and warmth in the finish but it's not overly hot and the high ABV is relatively well masked. Well balanced and complex but definitely a sipper.

In fact, it overflowed my glass and I didn't even pour as aggressively as I normally do. Asymmetrical lacing and clumps of suds stick to the glass. Aromas of toffee, cherry, and sorghum dominate. Citrus and alcohol sensations in the olfactory. It has a thick, smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of ultra sweet brown sugar and sorghum up front. A little citrus tartness on the back of the tongue accentuated by a mild carbonation burn. It has a sugary butterscotch hard candy finish. A good dessert sipper.","DocJitsu","Oct 17, 2012"

Shows less oxidation in the taste, it reminds me of a burnt raisin bagel...in a good way. This is an excellent barleywine that gets better the further into the bottle you get. To style, yet different. Smooth, but has enough rough edges to make it a sipper and keep you on edge. I like it, but not sure about the ageability.","twiggamortis420","Jan 23, 2011"

Figs and raisins come through the scent the most, but there are also other dark fruits and toffee in there. I also get raw honey and chocolate. Taste is quite exquisite. Very well balanced with the hops, malt, and dark fruits. This one has been aged over a year, so I'm sure it's more hoppy when fresh, but this just tastes great. I get vanilla, toffee, and honey too. The alcohol is definitely there, but balance almost perfectly throughout all the flavors. Fantastic barley wine style ale. Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied without being too syrupy.

3.9,-5.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"An average pour yields a super-sized, frothy head of reddish tan delicate, large bubbles which dimples down to the surface, while wispy the lacing pretty much there for good. Vibrant sunset red color, all burnt and aglow, the orange influence helps maintain transparency and brightness, only few scattered micro-bubbles to be seen. Tangerine, grapefruit initiates its presence in your nose, the pine, vanilla cream, coal tar, moss and lichens, toffee hit you scattershot, takes awhile to sort it all out, the breadiness is sweet and close to fruitcake, however, the nectarine, apricot, pineapple scents not aggressive, overall the hops clearly in control and, while messy, the good kind of messy. Medium-bodied and lighter of touch than expected, the carbonation flips the flavors like flapjacks in your mouth. Here you feel the alcohol and there's a whiskey, vanilla, oak barrel aspect upfront. The tangerine, pink grapefruit, blood orange citrus remains a major factor. Pine sap, floral dew, orange pekoe tea, moves into plusher golden raisin, fig to apricot, nectarine, mango, pineapple fruit. With some warming you get additional caramel, honey coating. Overall sweet and not that dry while at the same time not uncritically relying on sugar to impress. Hard to fully accept it within its typed idiom.","farrago","Jan 08, 2011"

The booze comes out more on taste but meshes good with the caramel notes alongside hopppy and slight brown sugar accents. It still had some good sweetness from the malts and candied sugar. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet slight dark fruity, hoppy, and sticky finish.

After finishing the 750, I'm fearful of tackling the -bal 750 (but I'll soldier on somehow, right?), so you definitely can feel the 11% here, even if you can't taste it. However, as it stands, this is a remarkably well-aged, complex, mature, easy-drinking beer. Crack 'em if you got 'em, and crack 'em alongside a -bal version of the same if you got 'em - who knows when the next time AleSmith will grace us with -bal versions of this or any of their other brews may be!

The finish is equal parts bubbly and boozy, with a pronounced warming from the alcohol. Body is medium-thick and a bit over-carbonated at first, but becomes more manageable as the drink progresses.

Complex and intense nose - grapefruit, citrus, caramel, malt, brown sugar and molasses. Consistent with nose, but also a little peppery, some dark fruits (perhaps prunes or figs), with a little residual booziness at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and quite bright and lively with a mild burn at the back of the throat. Typically not a style I seek out; however, this is delicious.

I forgot that I had this in my stash, so I figured that 2009 should be brought in properly with a properly aged barleywine. I believe this is a 2004 or 2005 bottle, so we're looking at around 4 or 5 years of aging. This is a delicious beer. Malty, chocolately, and fruity - everything is here and balance is the name of the game. There is not much in the way of overwhelming flavors here - what you have is an easy drinking barleywine that has aged incredibly well. I'd be very interested to try a fresh one to compare the differences. I guess that means a trip to San Diego is needed! Highest recommendation.","montageman","Dec 31, 2008"

Smooth pine and citrus notes perfectly balanced by sweet caramel and dark fruit aromas, I also get a little bit of sherry and some other vinous notes. Taste is sweet caramel and brown sugar with a beautiful array of hops joining in as well; finish is hoppy, but still plenty of sweet malt to it. Flavors are in perfect harmony, nothing overpowers anything else, instead they all work together. Full bodied, but not cloyingly sweet; carbonation is at about medium levels. Excellent beer.","badbeer","Dec 27, 2008"

Good head for such a strong non-Belgian beer. Somewhat sweet and malty, but not overly so in the aroma. This is well balanced with some nice citrusy hops and some spicebox scents. Very nice. English in aroma with a tad more hops than usual- without straying over into DIPA terrritory at all. The taste is also wonderful with more of that sweet maltiness restrained in its sugariness, some more citrusy hops, and faint spiceiness that complements rather than dominates. A beautiful example of the style, perhaps a bit less sweet, slightly more hoppy, and slightly more robust than English examples. Mellow mouthfeel, waxy and a bit creamy, and full without being harsh. Astonishing that this is 11% abv- it doesn't taste like it. How pleasant. I'm always a fan of Alesmith's stuff.","Georgiabeer","Mar 05, 2008"

The finish was explosive with the heat and the spiciness going right up the ol' chimney pipe and into the sinuses. It made my eyes water and then I sensed the tannins beginning to take over.

The smell is a thick rich malt over a nice hop and alcohol fibre that involuntarily cautions the user to dispense a meager portion for consideration. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is heavy but notably shy of being syrupy. Full flavored, the honey caramel vanilla taste is complemented by its smooth texture.

The taste and mouthfeel are excellent. Malts come through first with a light sweetness and luscious flavor, and the hops come through strong toward the middle and end.

THe pour was bubbly and deep dark amber, with some sweet molasses malts, and citrusy hop aromas. The taste was complex- defined brown sugars, ripe cherries round out the sweetness while the resinous hops hit the tongue with a grapefruit hop-bomb. The sweet burning from the alcohol is evident but not distracting whatsoever. The finish is dry and despite the oily hop flavor, stays that way. Great hop flavors and the brew is light even though the flavors are so thick. I finished one bottle myself in about 45 mins- there should be a warning on beers that taste this good.","kernalklink","Aug 26, 2007"

Taste follows with big pruney and plum sweetness, caramel breadiness is stronger in the flavor than it was in the aroma. Big rich sugary maltiness is nice and soft and creamy. It is cut by a small bite of alcohol at the back of the throat as well as some piney hops towards the finish. A warming alcohol blends with a nice drying hop finish.

The taste has an excellent balance with lightly sweet and complex malty intial flavor with good hop balance. The sweet malty finish is short- to meditum-lived.

The mouthfeel is adequatly carbonated up front, thick in the middle, and finishes clean and dry. This is a well constructed beer. Not as sweet as other barleywines, this one has plenty of hops.

If I could, I would buy this again and again. Pure pleasure. Taste reminds me of Sierra Nevada Bigfoot with the hops slightly muted. This isn't a bad thing as it gives the malt a chance to shine. In all, the taste is largely the same as the nose with the hops being far more understated. I'm really enjoying this. Mouth is lightly carbonated lending a velvet feel to the body.

Taste is also dominated by sweet malt but I cant find any complexity of dry fruits characteristics that I usually enjoy. Some hops provide a slightly bitter finish but nothing to overshadow the rest of the beer. Body is defiantly too thin and watery for my liking and alcohol is well hidden.

Big barley, bready, hoppy aromas stare down over a dense, ruby colored brew. Leaving good head retention and lacing, evidence of great proteins. Overwhelming flavors of barley malt, taking on molassas and brown sugar proportions. Intense hop flavor casts a piney, citrus shadow on on the malt base. Well aged and melded into a bitter, earthy, malt sweetened beverage. Alcohols take on caugh syrup intensity and reach a light solvent evaporative sensation. Though thick and heavy on the palate, the beer finishes a balanced sweet / bitter ratio. As great as it is, I often have problems assigning very high marks to the extremely-hopped Barley Wines. Alcohols strength also keeps me from scoring higher.","BEERchitect","May 17, 2006"

Initial hit on the nose was of citrus and fruit with a bit of pine, followed by some complex malts and a dash of hops. The piney smell was was carried through in the taste with a hint of citrus and some up front hops that give it a bitter kick.

Quite clean. Very good from a visual standpoint. The nose lays out some crusty malt dynamics. It reeks of dirty, sugar cane-like sweetness with some toasty and frankly burnt aspects. It has a roughness to it that gives it the barley wine attitude that is so appealing. The thing is raw and to be respected. Alcohol vapour rips through at times in true wraith fashion. The taste is funky old sweetness with a dryness fueled by the alcohol. Scorched caramel and apple skins in a sense. Somewhat chalky. This barleywine stays decent without overstepping its malt boundaries into a cloying demise. Brash, but accommodating. Nice. The mouthfeel is fairly light in my experience. The lighter and less intrusive use of malt lends to a lighter body and a drinkability that flourishes due to both the superb taste and less filling nature of this brew. Well tuned.

Toffee and pine become stronger as it warms and a hint of fruitiness creeps in as well. Caramel and toffee kick off the flavour, but balanced bitterness comes forward as the sweetness fades in the dry finish. Subdued hop flavour.

Spicy, medicinal, herbal hops increase in bitterness by the finish. Still, this is sweeter than it is hoppier (like an English style BW should be, no?).

There is a lot more going on here that I would have to drink another one to most likely identity in this very complex and wonderful smell. The taste has a big sweetness up front that tastes of caramel, rich fruits and spiciness. The hops are present and become more evident as this one warms and creates a bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is thick and rich and has decent carbonation. This is a very smooth barley wine that seems to improve with age from what I have read.

4.34,5.3,4,5,4.5,5,3,"2003 green bottle, cheers CapFlu Hazy orangey amber, very sticky off-white head, fully diminishing into a beautiful film. Aroma displays extremely complex malt profile which I'm bound to fall in love with. Potent maple, honey, caramel, cookies, molasses treats. Assertive fruitiness (lots of mango, plenty of peaches, dried bananas, oranges, watermelon, cantaloupe). It smells thick too with notes of bubble gum and brown sugar. Hard to describe overall, but every flavor is well presented and balanced by a subtle hop character and frankly, the best dessert pie never smelled that good. Taste displays more of that bubblegum I adore along with that chemy melon and soft marshmallows. After a few sips, the bitterness gets very pronounced, grapefruity, dry and bitter, a bit too much for me to appreciate in great quantities. It's a little sad though because it's my new favorite Alesmith and prefered California barley wine and there was more alcohol than I had hoped for in the taste despite being completely hidden in the aroma. Mouthfeel is top notch though, smooth as hell, velvety, chewy and creamy, medium-bodied and showing a perfect amount of carbonation. Did I say I like the aroma?","Rastacouere","Mar 22, 2004"
4.75,15.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"The flavor was outstanding. Tons of dark fruits. This beer was juicy and big and massive and the flavor never stopped in the mouth. Not once. Ripe fruits, a little banana with black cherries. Finish was long lasting. Big in the mouth. Both of us said that we wanted the entire 750 mL to ourselves and we meant it and we both could have done it. Very drinkable barley wine. Barley Wine: A style that is closely becoming my favorite but is very unmatched compared to Imperial Stouts, especially Speedway. I have had 3 beers from Alesmith so far: IPA, Speedway and Numbskull.

The taste is surprising in its restraint from bitterness. The hop flavor is here I full force though The body of this beer is like a beefy giant. I find myself enjoying this beer quite a bit. The interplay of the malt and hop is quite well done. The predominant taste is that of a hoppy nectar, there is a solid malt character & the bitterness is fairly subtle for an over hopped big beer (which I really like here). There seems to be some light oxidation notes here (perhaps a hint of sherry), which helps to further the complexity.

I tasted slightly sourish citrus flavours (try saying that 5 times fast), and a delicate sweetness that made me want more! I thought it had a good mouthfeel and better drinkability.

Smelled strongly of hops, more like a strong IPA than a barley wine. The malt sweetness and thick body are there, but the green bitterness stands way up front. An assault on the taste-buds, for sure. Clearly a quality (substantial) brew. I have become a big Barley Wine fan recently, and this is as good as any. Hops and malt both excel, strong, yet somehow still refreshing. A truly great brew, I'll give it an edge over Bigfoot and Old Crusty. It took awhile for me to work up to the really strong beers, but I love them now. Add this to the Speedway, IPA, and Wee Heavy as great Alesmith beers. Thanks, Ron!!!","JohnnyDuvel","Nov 30, 2003"
4.65,12.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a wonderful barleywine from the fine folks at Alesmith. The 1999 vintage of Old Numbskull is quite a chore to open. In fact my girlfriend can attest to this as she helped me peel off all of the black wax that this bottle is sealed in. After you get to the cap and open it, you also have to find a way to extract the rotting cork....luckily, I did this quite easily, and the beer that this rare bottle held within itself, was definately worth all of this effort. This beer pours out a very carbonated deep red/peach colour with an ample head of white bubbles! This was a much prettier barleywine than I expected it to be. Next we have the aromas, which were excellent, and consisted of sweet malts, slight citric and floral hops, and a nice flare of alcoholic spiciness. This kind of reminded me of HOTD's doggie claws, perhaps 99' DC may in fact smell like this stuff. The taste is wonderful, an explosion of sweet malts, with almost no hint of alcohol. The finish reveals some soft citric and floral hops as well as a nice flare of spices. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth on the tongue, the bottle conditioning and careful aging of this beer has really made this stuff feel like silk in your mouth. The drinkability is incredible, as you could knock this stuff back all night long. Can I get this on tap somewhere....please? No!? Well damn you than. This is really a penultimate version of the American barleywine, hand-forged to perfection by the brewers at Alesmith. I am very indebted to JCalabre for providing me with this old cellared example, of what I believe to be one of the top 5 barleywines made in the Unites States, er...no North America, er...no, what did I want to say?

Wonderful peach or apricot flavors with big hops that are bittering. Although not a typical Barley Wine style, this is one fantastic brew.

No cork. Poured into my glass, it's a dark brown brew with a reddish hue, topped by a small tannish head. The head goes down before too long to a modest lace clinging to the edges of the glass. I have to say this is the most unique barleywine I've ever smelled. Not only am I getting the expected caramel malt, English hops and citrus character (the brewer is said to have used a mix of American and English-style barleywine brewing techniques), and spicy alcohol, I'm getting some tart apple and apricot as well. The flavors are just as complex. At the front, some "English" hop bitterness sets the stage, and then a smooth wave of caramel malt takes over. The malt is slightly bready and yeasty as well. A bit of fruitiness is present, some fig and plum as well as a bit of the tart apple that was present in the nose. Very "Belgian." A hint of "American" citrus is detectable. Leafy/plum skin hop bitterness in the aftertaste, very pleasant. Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Surprisingly lighter bodied than most barleywines, but very complex and enjoyable. Very interesting and unique take on the style. It's like Belgium meets America meets England. I highly recommend trying this one.","hyuga","Sep 05, 2003"

The citrus flavors tend to dominate and detract slightly from the drinking experience.  Despite the 9.25% abv, the flavor of alcohol doesn't make itself obvious.  It has an almost milky mouthfeel that is reassuring in a barleywine.  It's good but it's not one of the best from Alesmith.","mickeymac","Oct 16, 2002"
