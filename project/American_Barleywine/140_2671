The hop profile on this is simply divine whether you are drinking a fresh batch beer or one that has aged in the cellar for 2-3 years. If does have minor variation for each vintage year, my favorite so far being circa 2012, but it is consistently excellent. While these are no longer sold in 6-packs and they are a bit pricey, it is certainly worth the cost to buy a couple of 4-packs. Drink 2-3 now and cellar the rest to see how they develop with age.","ch196h","Feb 28, 2015"

The putrid, caustic color belies a serum of the most unholy and wicked disposition.  I cannot fathom for the life of me why anyone would want to consume something which so closely resembles the embodiment of pure, black evil.

Similar to the nose but with a smokiness and a heavy bitterness at the end. My favorite part if this beer is the mouthfeel.  It's Very Thick and creamy.","BenwayPHD","Jan 21, 2015"

Finish is a roasty tartness. Thick mouthfeel producing fine carbonation in the mouth. A multitude of delicious flavors, aromas, and textures are exquisitely balanced. Also, drinks a lot easier than the ABV suggests.","maedhros09","Jan 18, 2015"

It's a nice drinkable mix of syrupy prune/plum with a hop bite. There is a dry finish and the alcohol isn't evident beyond the body, and the sweetness. It's not fair to compare this to aged/ other barley wines; some of said its a good "intro to barley wines" and I wouldn't disagree; but that should not under cut how enjoyable it is as a fine balanced beer.","Johnquisssssssy","Dec 29, 2014"

Honestly, I'm disappointed.  The hop character was too obvious and strong for my liking.  There was no sweetness that I tend to be used to with barleywines.  Roasted malts gave me an inkling of hope but they couldn't shine through enough due to the bitterness of the hops.  Oh well, ya win some ya lose some!","Geegmasta","Dec 15, 2014"

Bottle ages very well, flavors matured to add a nice chocolate/coffee punch, with little to no acidity to report on the finish. Enjoy a few now, but I highly recommend you set a few aside to age.

English style barleywines are more well rounded and balanced than their American counterparts. American barleywines are more akin to malty IPA's. But hey, whatever floats your boat I suppose. I would definitely try this one again but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out.","RexBanner","Oct 29, 2014"

I’m reading Randy Mosher’s ‘Tasting Beer’ right now, and he talks about cellaring these for at least five years; I think he’s on to something.  It’s an excellent beer, with tons of great malt flavor, but I think it’s really too aggressive when fresh, even though that’s the intention!","infinitebruner","Oct 03, 2014"

I'd prefer a little more balance, though, and the malt takes a major backseat in this brew.

I took notes on the first bottle of this I opened in 2006, and thought it was a lesser year; it was very astringent and overly dry. Those 8 years really added some character. Dang, the caramel flavors are much more pronounced, and the astringent flavors are all completely gone. I am so glad I didn't plow through this case and have about 9 left. I have a 2004 that was still good, but probably not as good as the previous year's tasting, so I am guessing around 8 years in the cellar is the optimal aging time for this barleywine. Your mileage may vary.","lungboy","Sep 02, 2014"

Smell is of dank piney hops, juicy citrus with a sweet caramel/malty secondary, the hops are really the star of the show here. Taste is full of pine and dank hoppy flavours right away, spicy, malty with a touch of sweetness but in terms of barleywine I would say this is quite dry, bitter hop aftertaste. Medium carbonation, full chewey body. This was really good, perhaps the fastest drinking barleywine I have ever had, I could probably have a couple of these in an evening with no complaints, best enjoyed fresh as this was.","peensteen","Jun 17, 2014"

This beer is big in ABV, but is just perfectly balanced and so satisfying to drink. Hoppy, malty and a joy in every characteristic that a beer should be, this baby is dangerously sessionable.

3.88,-6.3,5,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"2014 Vintage- The beer pours a deep, candied, ruby color with a nice, off-white head that borders on the color of white sand and has a mild retention. As the head goes, it leaves a thick blanket of lacing on the glass. The beers body is deep in color, but clear and rather translucent, even in its darkness. When I splash the beer against my glass, it leaves the briefest of alcoholic legs, hinting at the booze within it. As a whole, the beer is quite nice on the eyes. On the nose, the beer smells like an old-school DIPA: damply piney, with a strong caramel malt shiver running up the nostrils to suggest toffee. As it opens up, I start to get hints of plum and prune in the malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially of hop bitters (mostly of the pine variety). The middle of the sip sees a touch boozy heat, and towards the finish, the bitters are greeted by a powerful burst of caramel malt sweetness, which bends this beer back towards balance. Boozy heat and sweetness return on the finish, combining to intensify the afterfeel of bitterness in the mouth. In flavor, this beer begins with a fresh burst of sticky pine resin, moving slowly towards fresh pine needles and bitter medicine. This medicinal bitterness slowly blends into an ooie-gooey caramel and toffee sweetness. The transition bring hints of brown sugar-coated plums and prunes alongside solvent-like alcoholic heat. The finish sees a beautiful burst of caramel bread that has me looking forward to the things to come. The aftertaste is decidedly bitter with pine sap and medicine. In the mouth, the beer feels full bodied with a sticky, chewy mouthfeel, a middling carbonation, and a definite tingle on the tongue that could be coming from the alcohol or from hidden acidity. The sides of the tongue are shocked with bitter-bite once the beer has left the mouth, and the mouth as a whole is left dry except for the far extremities which pool spittle. Overall, fresh Bigfoot tastes like a boozy DIPA in today’s world. It’s hot, it’s hoppy, and it’s got a nice balancing malt that finishes quite elegantly and lets you know this is an American Barleywine. Admittedly, I’m more fond of the English Barleywines, but this is a classic of the American style, and has some nice complexity to it. This beer is a classic for a reason and should not be missed.","Maxwell","May 01, 2014"

Smell is actually much hoppier than I was expecting and there is very noticeable booze on the nose. Some dark fruits and brown sugar come through too. As for taste, the biggest thing I noticed is that while there is certainly still some molasses sweetness, this is one of the drier barley wines that I have had. Caramel, plum, hops, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is full bodied but not sticky and overly heavy like some barleywines can be. Low carbonation. Overall, a great barleywine, one of the more drinkable I've ever had. Lot's of hop character and not overly sweet. Only real complaint is that it is a bit boozey. I'm sure some aging would deal with that nicely.","Samuel906","Apr 05, 2014"

Specifically, the taste is malty sweet candy with a wonderful piney, bitter finish that tops it off. The alcohol is there but it does not overpower the hops and malt. I was a little disappointed that it went from a 6 pack to a 4 pack but I can appreciate the business sense of this. I do wish production and distribution would increase. I could find this product easily in the past but suddenly it's become difficult to find. Apparently the cat is out of the bag now.","againes","Apr 05, 2014"

The Bigfoot poured a deep ruby red with a significant head a good retention. This was a great looking beer. The aroma was very sweet and hoppy with citrus hops dominating into a sweet and slightly boozy tones. The taste was huge, with more bitter resinous hops on a bed of bittersweet malt that finishes with more pine hop notes. The bitter pine stays on your palate and lingers between sips of this mammoth brew. There is a slight alcohol finish that is hidden well underneath all the bitter hops and malt but definitely not dominant. Fresh the Bigfoot is dangerously drinkable and a thick,chewy, hoppy brew.","brurevu","Mar 27, 2014"

3.82,-7.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured straight down into a large style tulip it produced a massive, thick, fluffy, light beige/off-white three finger head with considerable staying power (after a couple of minutes in the glass it was still well over a finger) and considerable lacing. Color is a hazy, opaque, tawny brown with hints of amber. Nose is well balanced with crisp, piney, and slightly grapefruit hops underlying a big, malty nose presenting dark caramel, toffee, molasses, a tinge of vanilla and, well, just plain old malted sweetness. For a 9.6% abv, there is no sign on the nose of the higher alcohol content. Sip is bittersweet on the front of the tongue leading with lightly floral piney hop notes. Midpalate sees the full expression of this powerful and complex brew with an explosion of multi-layered sweet flavors from the malt including caramel, stewed fruits, dried Turkish apricot, sweet dark bread, and fruitcake. The hop component has a fresh and extremely well-balanced quality and presents a generalized sense of light citrus and pine bitterness. The back of the tongue and swallow sees an aggressive hop expression overtake some pronounced malty caramel notes, first in terms of light crisp pine notes and then an aggressive burst of tannic, slightly rubbery bitterness. Finish is somewhat thin, given the strength and depth of flavor on the sip, and consists most strongly of drying tannins with, again, notes of bitter grapefruit and pine. Despite a head suggesting massive carbonation, the mouthfeel was velvety smooth and slick while the alcohol never really showed up. I meant to A/B this with last year’s Bigfoot but before I could do it, someone at our holiday party back in December accidentally drank the 2012 Bigfoot I’d been saving all year. Grrr!! At any rate, based on my review of last year’s Bigfoot, this one seems a bit less hop forward and more malty, with some greater depth in the malt profile. I think that’s an improvement and a better reflection of what I’ve come to expect from American Barleywine’s. I’d like to see more happen in the finish, but all-in-all, this was a terrific brew and an excellent example of the style.","8stringfan","Mar 11, 2014"

As this warms up the caramel malt takes over, the hops subsides to a bright dark fruit taste, which balances very well with the strong malt presence. Overall, this beer is very good with a year on it and great with 2 years on.  When fresh this is good, but the hops, especially pine, overshadow the malt and fruit flavors. So meeting in the middle this gets a very good score, but it really depends on what one prefers in a barleywine, and I prefer less of a hop presence.","CTbrew32","Feb 13, 2014"

Just more hops than ever before. I mean really... Sierra Nevada takes the IPA model and makes every damn thing they brew taste like just another version of an IPA. Did I happen to mention that I detest IPA's? Cramming a brew full of hops does not equal a great brew-- it just shows a profound lack of imagination. But for all you hop-heads out there, you'll love this stuff. Personally, I'll pass, and thank you very little.","SoupKitchenBeerSnob","Jan 12, 2014"

Smell is pretty malty -- really sweet as one would assume from the style. Smells really nice but I could use a tiny bit of hops but nothing to take away from this beer. Taste is VERY malt forward with less sweetness in the mouth. I can definitely taste some hops at the end that really make this beer taste incredible as the piny hops seem to really balance out the malts. The mouthfeel is quite thick as one would expect. Overall I REALLY need to get some more of this stuff and age it. It's a great beer. hard to not drink it.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 20, 2013"

There are many better barleywines being made than this one. The main issue I have is that in creating an American version of this style they made the bitterness so intense that after two years of cellaring it is still too bitter and too unbalanced for my palette. 70 IBUs with something other than Chinook or Centennial would help to make the malt more prominent along with less sulfate in the water. Otherwise it is just overly simple for the style. It would be better dry-hopped to make a triple IPA like Founders Devil Dancer. That should be the target for Bigfoot. At least that beer improves with age and is good fresh. The 1990s are gone and we should all expect more from a great American brewery that helped to buck the status quo.","dbrese","Dec 01, 2013"

My aim is to open the next one in a few years or so to see how it has aged, as it seems 4 years is the collective recommendation.","machalel","Oct 09, 2013"

Nice taste, like brandy but without the booziness. A little winey sweetness, a little hop bite that finishes a bit bitter, some carbonation but light, overall more ale-like than wine-like. At 9.5% abv, I am definitely feeling it, yet it doesn't taste especially boozy. Still a sipper, but enjoyable.","Gwalchgwynn67","Sep 11, 2013"

Palate is a full body, smooth and nicely balanced with a sweet slight bitterness and sticky mouth feel. Finishes with a nice caramel malt, yeast and fruity with slight bitter notes, undoubtedly tamed by the aging. Aroma and flavor intensify as it warms up.

Left some yeast floating on top and some sticky, sticky lace. Just beautiful. Nose is big sweet malt. Delicious and fat with caramel, toffee and grain. Hops round it out with dark fruits, cherry and floral. Touch of spice way, way in back. Malt opens up fat and bold as it warms. It’s sweetness deepens but never goes over the top. Hops character is always forthcoming, enlivening and bursting with resin and bitter. Alcohol stays well hidden until the end and contributes to the dryness in the finish. Balance is perfect between the big sweet grain and the oily bitter. This is a strapping, and downright huge beer that was a pleasure from first sip to last.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Then the tasting took it to a whole other level with awesome caramel flavors and a slight strike of alcohol, but overall was well-balanced and good.

I'm not much of a hop head, so the aggressive hop nature wasn't really up alley. It was a decent beer, but I certainly could have spent my money elsewhere. Oh well. You win some, you lose some, and I lost this one big time.","TheCondor","May 27, 2013"

Didn't have a lot of carbonation at first, rather lots of little bubbles that kept coming for a while. Smelled hoppy, but in a deep, imperial kind of way. Floral, not fruity. Interesting taste; taking a gulp, it has a bit of a not-well-hidden sweetness to it, but the hops are there to let you know who's boss. I enjoyed the initial taste, but thought that the hops lingered far too long afterward, and left a sticky, unpleasant coating behind. Overall, I was expecting some more malt presence, and was disappointed by how quickly the big hops came in and dominated the slightly sweet flavoring. It made me long for the quick burst of raisin/date sweetness that remained just out of reach.","yankeepride","Apr 26, 2013"

For some reason, this just doesn't add up. A good beer which will get you nice and toasty, I just have a hard time associating this as a barleywine and more as an imperial west-coast IPA. This is based off taste and smell, not how it is brewed. I devour most things Sierra Nevada, and while I am not disapproving, I extend a word of caution. Treat this as more of its own raw ale instead of a barleywine, and your palate will be appeased.","BrausBeforeHaus","Apr 10, 2013"

Smells of piney/resinous and fruity hops; plus caramel/toffee flavors from the malts. The taste is bitter upfront from the hops and then followed by the malts with hints of caramel/toffee flavors. Medium body with some carbonation on the tongue. Bitter and sticky on the finish. A nice, hoppy barley wine. Can't wait to age a few and see how they turn out!","ChrisL24481","Apr 10, 2013"

Appearance is a deep brown with a reddish hue and a thin, yellowish-white colored head with decent retention. The nose is full of Pacific NW hops and yeast as it fades into a peppery finish. Taste is where everything comes together. It has a bittersweet body as the hops and yeast precede and compliment a malty background with a semi-peppery finish. Smooth with just the right mount of carbonation, this beer goes down nicely. Overall, it's a superb brew. This is my first barleywine styled beer ever, so my bar is set very, very high.","Jacurdy60","Apr 01, 2013"

I notice the big malt presence, but it is clearly overshadowed by the hops at this point. A bitter flavor lingers. Medium-low carbonation. Medium-heavy mouth feel. I would like a bit more creaminess.

4.28,3.4,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Year-old. The beer pours a deep amber with ruby red highlights, a tight creamy head, and plenty of lacing. Sweet malt aromas hint at toffee and molasses while grapefruit and other citrus hop aromas dance around a touch of alcohol. Caramel and slightly roasted malt flavors build a delectable level of sweetness that is met by a bitter bite that brings hints of grapefruit, cantaloupe, and pine resin. Well balanced, this one-year-old barleywine is leaning on being medium-full in the body with a moderate level of carbonation. This is the barelywine all other American versions are measured against, and for good reason!","phishsihq","Mar 09, 2013"

This is bursting with ripe fruit character; an almost equally big citric hop flavor comes in toward the finish. A little bit of booziness that's appropriate for the style. Mouthfeel features a little bit of viscosity and a moderate but soft carbonation - a good complement to a big beer while still reminding you that this is beer, not wine.","gr0g","Mar 06, 2013"

All of our friends in the dorm had gone out to party without us! So he called in a favor to a friend with an ID and told him to buy a sixpack of beer that had the highest alcohol content in the store (priorities in college). His friend soon delivered some Bigfoot and the two of us split the six pack and then went out to find the rest of the group. 3 bigfoots a piece and we never missed a beat once we caught up to the rest of our friends who had been out partying most of the night! the 2013 version is much smoother than the 2001 version and brings back all the memories.

Taste follows the aroma pretty well, strong spiced hop upfront melded with strong roasted and spicy malts. Some citrus undertones help mask the alcohol that makes the after taste.

If it weren't for the bittering piney hops, this beer would be WAY too sweet for my tastes... I can't say enough how bitter, sweet, syruppy, malty, alcohol"y" this beer is. It also reminds me slightly of Dogfish Head's Burton Baton because of the strong "alcoholic syruppy caramel oakiness". It's surprisingly well balanced, but in a "everything is strong" sense.

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2011 vintage bottled 12/30/2010. Pours lightly cloudy reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big orange zest, pine, grapefruit, caramel, molasses, toast, biscuit, herbal, and earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of big pine, orange zest, caramel, raisin, molasses, toast, biscuit, herbal, floral, grapefruit, earth, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, orange rind, pine, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, earth, herbal, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Great balance of flavors with good complexity; nice bitterness/sweetness balance; no overly cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! Nice balance and complexity of flavors; very smooth and crisp to sip on. Highly enjoyable offering with the age on it. Looking forward to seeing how it changes down the road.","superspak","Oct 21, 2012"

4.45,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark brown body with dirty edging and a surprising level of lacing. Smells of toffee and pine. The hops are mysteriously still relevant alongside a dash of noticeable alcohol and light oxidation. Taste is muted toffee and caramel, faded pine and some faint wet cardboard. Its bitter, still. With the muted flavors the alcohol does make itself known. For being 11 years old this is incredible. Light oxidation complimenting against toffee and caramel and a surprising piney hop presence. Perhaps the best candidate for aging I have ever experienced.","davey101","Jul 31, 2012"

The nose is rather absent. Taste is vile. It probably wouldn't taste so bad if not magnified by the mouthfeel. There's an overwhelming hop sourness that dominates the big malt one expects to experience in a barleywine. The piney hop resin coats the palate and continues to invade the senses well after the finish. I want my money back.","DocJitsu","Jul 29, 2012"

Once maligned as America's most unhealthy beer, it is now a reasonable sub-10% abv in a world where bigger is assumed to always be better. It shares the same house quality of spicy (fresh) Cascade hops that adorns Sierra Nevada's pale ale and Celebration IPA. Often tried by unsuspecting celebrators, this isn't really a beer for changing minds or creating trends. However, it is always there in case one's taster needs recalibrating.","beagle75","Jun 17, 2012"

The newest ones are a nice clear red amber, the '03 pours a somewhat darker, more opaque red amber. Minimal head on the '03 and '11, nice thin, long lasting head and lacing on the '10. The newer ones have a sweet malt, fresh hop aroma. The '03 has a more subdued sweet malt and dark fruit aroma. '11 has distinct fresh hops, sweet malt, dark and dried fruit and an almost pine flavor. '10 is the best with dark fruit and the sweet malts becoming more forward and mellow, but with a nice hop finish; not as fresh hopped as the newer one, but my favorite of the three. The '03 has completely mellowed, with a sweet malt, dark fruit and English barley wine flavor but with a subtle hop finish. These are all excellent and I look forward to tracking the newer ones through time.","LiquidAmber","Mar 30, 2012"

The aroma is similar but more muted in that the pine has receded and mostly what comes through is grapefruit zest with a bit of caramel in the background.  The dominant flavor is grapefruit zest but traces of the malt still come through.  The mouth feel and carbonation are much as they were three years ago but the finish has become less bitter although the grapefruit is still there to fade away.   Nicely drinkable and the beer has held up well, but I'm not at all sure there has been any improvement with age.","drtth","Mar 25, 2012"

Carbonation appears to be plentiful and the head does not dissipate quickly like you would expect from something greater than 9% alcohol. Some lacing gets left on the glass. This looks very appealing. The aroma is of slightly sweet dark roasted malt and the piney hops are very forward. The hops explode in the mouth on the first sip and the malt character is also very detectable. It's slightly sweet. There's some citrus in the taste as well as some alcohol in the aftertaste. As the beer warms even more, the sweetness from the malt comes out even more. The hops flavor bursts in mouth, providing even more balance as this beer warms. Wow. The mouthfeel is full and it's very smooth. The beer coats the mouth well and the carbonation helps the drinkability of this beer. This becomes even easier to drink as it warms even more. This was my first American style barleywine and I have to admit that I was impressed with Bigfoot. This is simply an excellent beer and one of the best I've ever had. If you haven't tried this beer, try it immediately. I would love to try this beer with more age on it.","acevenom","Mar 24, 2012"

All components of the taste work extremely well together, even with the mild alcohol and strong bitterness. The warm, dry, and oily mouthfeel would be very hard to top as well.

Little in the way of developed malt or fruit character, though the high-alpha-crazed hop heads will undoubtedly like it. Rated as a barleywine, American or otherwise, I feel that it falls short, and if I wanted Torpedo I could pick up a twelve pack for what I paid for this sixer.

When sipping there is a multi-layered mouth feel which has a fruity, flowery impact at first, giving way to a very bitter and dry, hop finish. Slightly piny.

Some strong piney hops and a solid caramel malt backbone but not quite the complexity I have come to expect from barleywines. The taste is very good, well balanced. I mean this in the best way possible but, it tastes like an amped up SN Pale Ale. A lot of the same hop aroma and malt signature just a bit more intense. Very clean bitterness that is refreshing and prevents the big body from getting too cloying. Very nice mouthfeel, very easy drinking. Overall this is a very solid brew though it sort of straddles the line between DIPA and American Barleywine. I had never had one this fresh and the hops were still very prominent, so glad this comes in 6 packs, looking forward to cracking them open with age.

Very solid beer, and a really classic representation of the style; it may not be as big or as hoppy or as rich or as hot as a lot of other examples, but it makes up for all of these things with balance and, to be frank, a degree of finesse. (Not that there’s anything understated about this at all.) Cheers to Sierra Nevada, for making this beer and continuing to fire on all cylinders, even after all these years (even if this IS one of their most classic products).","fmccormi","Nov 14, 2011"

Even after almost a year, this is still extremely hoppy. And while sipping it has a great lacing quality. This beer I think needs at least 3-4 years before it has a nice malty sweetness, but even now it is a hopheads dream, and it's drinking amazingly well!","PaulStoneAnchor","Oct 26, 2011"

You can definitely smell the barley here, and there's also an underlying sweetness. When you taste it, the hops are definitely there at first, but fade into a maltiness that really brings the beer together. Mouth feel is a little underwhelming, although the carbonation level is good. This is the first barleywine I've had/reviewed, but it's a style I'll definitely return to, especially with the cold months coming up.","cneville","Oct 03, 2011"

I wonder what it would be like aged another year since if I've read the date stamp right, it's been about a year in the bottle and it's still massively hoppy. Might try it again sometime or pick up a bottle now and cellar it a year to see if the hop profile changes and the malt comes out more.","damndirtyape","Oct 02, 2011"

Upon opening bottle I'm hit with earthy, citrusy hops. Sweet malts. Smells like a barleywine. Taste is caramel, sweet malts, some citrus and earthy hops. Well-rounded and tight. Some bitterness at the end of the taste. Alcohol pleasantly warms the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied, I am slightly distracted by a cloy aftertaste. Overall this is a solid barleywine.

Sticky, off-white lacing is left as it settles. Smells of hops (strongly, being spicy, bitter, and vaguely citrusy), faint caramel, and dark fruits. A bit of citrus in the rear makes it resemble a DIPA in scent. The similarity continues into the taste, where the hops lead the way before the malt, date, raisin, and brown sugar make themselves known. Lacking in too much else though, as the hops are really quite pronounced. Mouthfeel is heavy, with the carbonation and alpha acids cutting only slightly through the rich body. Overall, an enjoyable barleywine now, but I will certainly cellar a few away to happily age.","eclipse54","Aug 28, 2011"
4.17,0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O: I think this is the first Barley Wine I've had, and it's (of course) pretty strong stuff, but once I got past that first stroke of alcohol I felt: 'This is a warming and really enjoyable beer'. Perhaps it wouldn't've been a bad idea to get more bottles, to store, for the years to come - with time (and experience) there might be more for me to appreciate.","stjaernstoft","Aug 27, 2011"

Smell is so different then any beer that comes to mind. Sweet and piney heaven. Some carmel, biscuit, and grass. Taste is all that with a grapefruit/breadyness. Some how it works and in another 4 months it turns into another amazing animal. Plenty of body and carbonation.

The taste has mellowed out a bunch on the hops, I get a bunch of toffee/caramel and some hop bitterness, with the less hops, I get a hair more alcohol taste than with the 2011. It a little sweeter and more of a malt bomb also (Is this closer to a proper barley wine?). Honestly, I prefer the ultra bitter DIPA taste of it fresh, but this is still pretty good. 4/5.

I often read in the forums of people asking for a great beer that is easier to find then the ones on the top 10 list, well look no further folks, here it is.

3.75,-9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A translucent red beer that goes into brown shades in its deeper parts. Head is small, off white, and leaves plentiful lacing. Hops and the oh-so familiar raisin, fig, date-ish smells in the nose. The taste is much of what the nose is though more well blended-- while in many beers the dark fruits and hops are simply concurrent, in this beer they are fused together into one taste that is interesting and make both more delicious. Despite the fusion, hops definitely take the forefront with the dark fruits taking the undertone. Mouthfeel has some alcohol burn on the top of the throat, but the bitter sensations in the mouth are pleasant. Solid barleywine overall, but mostly just a more well-crafted version of generic flavors and sensations.","Klym","Jul 04, 2011"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Bigfoot pours a deep red coppery color. A two finger head of off-white foam floats on top for a moment, then recedes leaving a delicate lattice of lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose is hops and sweet malt, emphasis on the hops. Taste starts out with citrusy hop flavors. Exquisite bitterness is momentarily balanced by a very nice malt backbone, then careens back into hoppy goodness. Finish is dry with an excellent lingering bitterness. Feel is thick and viscous with a lower level of carbonation that serves to enhance the bitter character of this big barleywine. Alcohol is masterfully disguised by the interplay of hops and malt rendering an extremely drinkable beer. Overall this a wonderful take on the style by Sierra Nevada, a supremely bitter, satisfyingly malty brew that is a joy to savor. A yearly favorite!","Sideswipe","Jul 04, 2011"

The bottle was from 2009 so I'm guessing it's mellowed a little bit and I like how the booze cuts through the sweetness a little bit.

The taste is rich and heavy on the pine hops, but also with some nice hints of the malts as well. The beer had a heavy feel to it, dense and almost chewy with a heavy bitter aftertaste. Overall, the beer lacks some drinkability due to the high ABV, but that is not to say that the beer is not drinkable. If I was able, I would have had a couple.

Scent is dominated by piney hops, moderate amounts of citrus (orange) and herbal hops, some astringent qualities before the malt even arrives. Malt scent is very sweet and syrupy. Taste is as the scent would have predicted... hop forward, warm burn of alcohol and a big syrupy like sweetness. Full bodied, heavy on the palate, lingering astringency and warmth. While a very nice beer - this pupy definitely needs some age - overly hoppy and boozy, will hunt out a vintage bottle or age the next recent one i see for comparison.","rfgetz","Jun 16, 2011"

Color is a combination deep amber and dark orange with a very heavy, viscous haze....almost like carbonation bubbles frozen in suspension. Heavy but smooth with a light resinous, yet creamy feel. Aromas are not as intense as I expected, but a nice balance of citrus orange and sugary sweet caramel malt with a hint of pine and biscuit. Intense citrus and pine hop flavors in the front. Citrus flavors slowly fade as the pine hop bitterness intensifies through the finish. The hop flavors ride an intensely sweet malty backbone from beginning to end. Long lasting pine bitter hoppiness with alcoholic heat clearly showing at the finish. Depsite the intense sweet and bitter flavors, the feel and slowly evolving flavors provide a mellowness to this brew.","IronLover","Jun 06, 2011"

This is the first Sierra Nevada brew i've had beside SNPA and their porter, and this has made me change my opinion of the brewery. I put 2 bottles in the cellar to see what happens. I can only see this getting better with a year or 2 on it.","1Adam12","Jun 05, 2011"

It pours an ever-so-slightly hazy amber-garnet topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, toffee, orange peel, light pine, very light mint, and a touch of cantaloupe. The taste is as though a mountain of citrusy hops (grapefruit, pineapple, cantaloupe, and then some pine as well) was thoroughly drizzled with thick, sweet caramel. A nice balance, with a sizable, though not o'erwhelming, amount of booziness. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, a very nice b-wine, one that is more than deserving of its status.","TMoney2591","May 27, 2011"

Between the substantial content of malt sweetness and hops bitterness and the dense mouthfeel, I could only take small sips of this beer. Moreover, I only think I made it about half way through the bottle because the beer was so intense. I think my Bigfoot would have been considerably more enjoyable if it had been aged for at least a year; my bottle was from the 2011 batch.

4.11,-0.7,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall I though this was a pretty good barleywine. Pretty much all the Barleywine's I have had have all been heavy on the malts and malt forward, in this brew the malts take a back seat to the hops. I think I like the malts forward Barleywine's better but I can still appreciate the complexity's of this highly hopped Barleywine. I fell like the malt heavy ones are better suited for the colder temperatures of the winter, while this highly hopped one seems better suited for those cooler summer nights around the camp fire, each one has it's own good time and place. I don't know if this beer is that drinkable but since it is not as sweet as some of the other ones I have had I could see cracking another one if I had it. If I can find a 6 pack I think I will buy it, this would make a great summertime Barleywine. If you like your Barleywine's Hop forward then this is the brew for you, hell if you just a fan of Barleywine's in general you should try this. This was a great solid beer from Sierra Nevada, I would like to throw a couple of these in the cellar to see how this brew stacks up once the hops start to fade, I am willing to bet it will taste even better but completely different. This is up their with Torpedo for the best beer I have had from Sierra Nevada. EDIT- The 2012 version is just as good and even more intesence since this one was much fresher the 2011 I had last year, through and through one of the best looking barleywines and a really intense beer.","StoutHunter","May 16, 2011"
4.3,3.9,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Aroma is fruity with an undertone of malt and a firm hint of molasses. It pours a pretty dark brownish amber, almost mahogany, with a thick, fluffy, fairly persistent white head. Luscious flavor is fruity and woody with hints of caramel and brown sugar. Alcohol bite is present and a bit tinny, but not as strong as with most barleywines, which is a plus. Texture is smooth, fizzy and edgy, leaving a tingly and woody finish. I for one recommend this to barleywine lovers.","Cyberkedi","May 14, 2011"
4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Deep amber pour with a tinge of ruby with an off-white two finger head that has good retention and great lacing. Lots of citrus in the nose, specifically tangerines, with a solid sweet malty backbone and a hint of alcohol. The taste is intense! Huge resiny, tangy, spicy, hop bitterness with a good measure of pine and orange peel and a hint of cinnamon. This is all nicely complemented by a syrupy malt sweetness that tries to tame the intense bitterness. This thing really opens up nicely as it warms. A thick and chewy sipper with a subtle alcohol burn. A classic interpretation of the style. Yet another winner from one of my favorite breweries!","beerdrifter","May 12, 2011"

The foam sat atop the glass for a good three to four minutes before dissipating enough to drink. The aromas are very sweet and full of raisins especially. You also get sweet carmel malts and cherries. Unfortunately the flavors aren't quite as complex. You get a boatload of sweet malts, oak, vanilla, caramel, and candied sugar but it's hard to get past the sweetness. This three year old barleywine drinks a little flatter than I'd like. It's lost considerable carbonation throughout time. Overall this is definitely a solid barleywine, but it's very, very sweet and too sweet for my liking. Tasting verticals of Bigfoot through the years is fun to watch and taste. The change can be pretty considerable.","aasher","May 06, 2011"

The aroma holds a great deal of caramel malt, some citrus and some dark fruit. The flavor holds a great balance between a grapefruit/grass hop flavor and caramel malt, there’s also elements of plum, brandy, and alcohol. Full bodied and supermalty over the tounge with a bitter finish gives this brew a great bittersweet experience over all.

The aroma was also nice, with a slight fruitiness and spice, amongst the hoppiness and grain.

Still, like a Beatles album, there is a reason it has become a classic that is a standard bearer for all that followed. The spicy hop character is brimming with pine and more subtle, darker character that is both influenced by and harmonizes with the deep, sugary malt.

It has a creamy mouthfeel at the beginning then i got a toasty feeling towards and at the end. Though the taste is a liitle strong for me, I point out that a) I'm drinking it at room temp out of my favorite laser etched pint glass, and b) I can only assume that because of my general lack of drinking any Sierra Nevada styles it make me a noob to this good beer.

Smells of biscuits, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and citrus zest. Taste is very similar but in the reverse order of the smells: citrus zest hops, brown sugar/caramel/toffee, with the biscuit like malt coming through at the end. Medium hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Thick and chewy in the mouth with each sip. Slight alcohol burn in the throat. Overall, this is a good barleywine that packs a hop punch.

Smells of caramel malts, a hint of brown sugar, and a tad bit of roasted malt. Hops shine in the American Barleywine raging through with pine and grass type hops. Taste is ridiculous crazy, so many malt notes bundled up in one beer compiled with the immense amount of hopping should be illegal, just to make it more fun to partake! This beer is a wicked treat. I remember when I was getting into English Barleys, and picked up one of these monsters, I was flabbergasted! I had no idea what was going on in my mouth other than an explosion of flavors! Overall, this is one heavy monstrous brew, and should be handled with care.

The appearance of the beer was a muddy golden color with some brown in there. The head was white and had some good retention. The aroma of the beer was really hoppy for a barley wine. The other aromas if any where difficult to pick out. The flavor was big and bitey. There was a lot of complexity in here there were hops and malts colliding, there was some dark fruits in the aftertaste lingering around it was pretty different from anything I had tried prior to this.

There was a lot going on in many directions and it seemed muddled up. the beer was almost amber with great clarity, a small tan head, fast fading retention and little lace. The smell was amazing! Tons of hops! Citrus, pine, floral and grassy, lemon and grapefruit, pear and green apple, with a nice sweet caramel and honey in the back. The taste just didn't come together right for me. It was hard to finish. The alcohol was well hidden behind the hop bomb, but the hops was all over the place. Bitter grapefruit with lemon notes, resiny pine and green apple were fighting. Hints of pear, caramel and honey just didn't make a smooth mix. Hints of butterscotch, and a slight burn of alcohol. Light fruity characters. Just too much going on. Oily and slick.

Finishes incredibly dry which accentuates the bitterness... and I think that is one of the main things I don't like about Bigfoot.

The balance of the malts and hops give a very balanced beer, especially for it being the newest edition.

It took me 8 years of drinking Bigfoot to realize that, but I really like the fresh hop profile and supremely balanced malt without any oxidation taking hold. An American original, for sure...but some other barleywines have perfected what SN started since then. Rambling, I know...just reflecting on the crazy growth of craft beer over the past decade.

Carbonation is mild. Aroma is of sweet clean malt mixed with a nice balance of citrus hops. 1st sip brings a tart, dry blast of citrus & pine soaked hops. As the beer lingers on the tongue there is a slight hint of sweet caramel, bit the hops push it WAY into the background. There is a good amount of alcohol on the swallow. The mouthfeel is solid, with a slight carbonation sparkle. Drinkability is limited, due to the alcohol burn. I'm reviewing this freshly bought, a few months (or couple years) of aging would have an interesting effect I believe, so i'm gonna save one or two of these to sample in 2012 or 2013 and see if they mellow some.

The body and mouth feel were very nice but once again the taste was almost over powered by hops, again a bit out of place for the style, in my opinion. That aside this beer if labeled differently, say maybe an imperial IPA or a specialty IPA, is a repeat drink.

The nose has a surprisingly strong undertone of hops which does a decent job to balance the caramel malty smells. The flavor is complex, and honestly feels like it changes as it swims through my mouth. Wow. The first thing I got was a blast of flavor, both hoppy and caramel sweet, but that went by quickly. The next thing I tasted was a littly boozey and a little peppery. The quickly transitioned to a smokey flavor so strong I thought my uvula had been set on fire. Subsequent drinks give similar kaleidescopic flavors, and I also start to pick up some slight sour notes and the steadiness of the hops bitter throughout the taste, although sometimes stronger than others. Very complex. Every once in a while I get a flash of some grapefruit type flavors, too...a little tart and a little sweet. All of these flavors ride a creamy and smooth body that transitions to crisp right at the end. The beer leaves a slightly bitter and puckered feel after swallow, and that feeling lingers a while along side the slightly sour and spiced aftertaste. This beer begs to be consumed. Shockingly easy to drink despite the slightly elevated ABV and the robust catalog of flavors. Now the test will be of my will power to keep from drinking the rest of this and actually age some of it.","GarthDanielson","Mar 07, 2011"

Tons of piney notes and very little malt. It literally smells like a pine tree. Taste is where the hops and malts mesh a bit more, although it remains predominantly hop forward. Tons of pine flavors with some very sweet candied malt flavors. Finish has just a tad bit of alcohol with bittering hop finish. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but refreshing and full bodied. Drinkability is high, as I find it to be one of the more drinkable barleywines. I could probably drink about 3 of these in one sitting. Overall, I love this beer...for the price of a six pack(9.99 at local grocery store), it cannot be beat. I've had this beer with a couple years on it though, and I prefer the older vintage.

4.17,0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"2011 Vintage! Served from tap into an imperial pint. Poured red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine resin, big pine hops, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, big pine, big pine hops, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. I know this one gets hyped up a lot about older vintages and such, and now I can see why... Even fresh this brew is excellent. I can see it really coming to life after a few years. For right now the alcohol was a bit intrusive on the palate during the followthrough. If you like pine notes, this is for you fresh. The pine aspect in this one was HUGE. A definite must try, aged or fresh, for sure.","thagr81us","Feb 17, 2011"

The smell with age on it is so perfect with the smell of sweet candy and sugar. Simply perfect. The taste is a little maltier than the smell with more molasses but still a ton of candy sugar in the taste. God this beer is delicious. The mouthfeel is so much smoother than a young Bigfoot, but still not a super smooth Barleywine like a 2010 Nemesis is. It is drinkable, but in slow sips so that you enjoy it and don't overpower your palate. My 2nd favorite barleywine next to 2010 Nemesis that I have had. I am looking forward to trying 3 Floyds Behometh and seeing how it compares to my top 2 thus far.","mcgwire756","Feb 16, 2011"

Its just to hoppy and hot and the malt character is a little boring, but it develops very nicely in the bottle.

The problem here is that without the hops you are left with a less complex beer. It becomes more similar to an English style but lacks the depth. I think this one is best to be drunk fresh. Don't get me wrong this is certainly a good beer; maybe some more time will help this one out. I'll stick to my fresh Bigfoot.

All the other qualities that mentioned will turn out better with age in the 2010 I'd assume. Who knows. I could be wrong.

The taste smacks you in the face with hops and very rich sweet malted barley. Very rich tasting. This tastes like an IPA with a shit load of malt. The rich malt flavor reminds me very much of the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA malt profile. Actually this is like Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale times 5. So if you like the Celebration Ale and want that same taste but with even more bitter hops and and that same malt but a lot more of it this is your beer. Actually the Celebration Ale and this beer have the same ingredients. They both use two row malt and English barley with the Cascade Chinook and Centennial hops. Amazing beer this is the total definition of an American hopped Barleywine.","thebrood1987","Nov 23, 2010"

The beer is sweet, with a caramel malt taste, with a solid citrus hop flavor, all very well balanced together. The mouthfeel is interesting, the body of the beer is between a medium and heavy feel. Feels almost silky at some point in the mouthfeel. The alcohol content is high in this beer but it is very well masked with flavor. This would be considered a sipping beer, but I think it is very drinkable.","arboristfish","Nov 20, 2010"

Taste was more barleywine-esque then the smell. Good contrast between the sweetness and the alcohol up front, with a great bitter tasting finish.

The pour reveals a reddish-amber beer with a fantastic head and lacing that seems to bind onto the glass. The nose of this beer is wonderful. It is full of astringent piney hops blended with citrus overtones, big malts layered with raisins and caramel with a very faint layer of alcohol. The taste is full of hops, citrus oils, pine and a big malt spine loaded with raisins, some caramel and a touch of honey. Really fantastic. A great mouthfeel, so smooth and easy to drink for a beer that has a massive harshness in its first few months. The carbonation levels are on the medium to medium low levels. A faint alcohol tinge is noticeable, but this beer is one of the few that can make the tinge pleasant.

4.15,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"First time I've seen Bigfoot in stores, had to pick it up. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, 2010 Bigfoot is a clear, copper-orange color with a thick, foamy, amber-tan colored hop head (no pun intended). Bubbles rise through the glass like Champagne. The nose, to no great surprise is mostly all west coast hops like grapefruit, pineapple, heavy pine resin and floral but there are also some grainy sweet and toasty notes to boot. Hop lover's bouquet! The flavor (to no surprise again) leans towards the hop side as well with the hop flavors previously mentioned, piney and resinous more than fruity. The malt does its best to balance but this one definitely leaves a bitter aftertaste. There is a slight alcohol burn, but nothing out of line for 9.6%. Mouthfeel is full in body with a minimal but chewy carbonation and semi-dry finish. Overall, drinkable beer yes but this is definitely no quaffer.","gmfessen","Sep 13, 2010"

The smell is somewhat sweet, but also a bitterness that definitely comes from the hops. Taste-wise this was just as I've read from previous reviewers--grapefruit hops, with an undertone of sweetness.

A tan head of small bubbles rests atop the beer. It has a sweet malty alcohol aroma. I'm picking up notes of raspberries and toffee. There is still a lot of hop and alcohol in the taste, even after two years of aging. There is a kiss of bitterness, but it doesn't linger too long. There is some sugary sweetness still present, but not nearly as much as fresh strong beers. There is a biscuit-like quality up front, but it is different from the Belgian wheats that I associate with this trait. It has a medium to heavy body. Not much carbonation is left, but a lot of stickiness remains. The alcohol in the aftertaste limits my drinkability. This is a large pour and I'll have a hard time finishing it.

Definitely comes off as english malts vs. west coast hops and the hops are winning the battle as this one is only a few months old (12/30/2009 dating).

The hop is very upfront, and probably a tad bit more leafy than anything else. The beer is very well balanced with its thick creamy maltiness. There are lots of crystal and pale malts, not much graininess at all, very smooth and clean. The ABV on this beer is quite evident and is rather warming and not overly boozy. The beauty of this beer is its balance. The assertive hops are held together nicely by a malty and creamy base underneath. The ABV keeps this beer strong, a bit unrestrained, and warming. The beer is ultimately a strong sipping beer with lots more maltiness than you would find in a more vinous and syrupy barleywine. My vote is to label this as a DIPA. L'Chaim.","albern","Feb 28, 2010"

Honey and cane sugar in the nose, a touch boozy, candied orange peels, uncommonly grainy for the beer style, floral as well, suggestion of apricot or peach fruit. Full-bodied, however, the foaminess of the carbonation only increases its density, to the verge of becoming ponderous. The orange, grapefruit citrus more edgy here and the herbaceousness rises quite a bit. For a barleywine, this is a total hopfest, any caramel or honey accents way in the background. The apricot, nectarine fruit also recedes. Hence, what the hell is sweet here?

Very strong aroma of hops, and alcohol isn't hiding very well in there, either. Taste is upfront barleywine, mostly malt and alcohol, with the aftertaste of the ample hops that were smelled originally.

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"My first Bigfoot, actually my first Barleywine so I'm kinda excited. Pours a dark red, copperish color with a small white head that disappears but not entirely. Leaves some ok lacing down the glass. The smell is slightly hoppy, malty, and kind of fruity with a hint of caramel. Not as hoppy in the smell as I was expecting but those piney hops are there. Taste wise it's pretty good. The piney hops stick out more to me in the taste than the smell, I was able to pick up the hoppier taste of the fresh Bigfoot I've heard a lot about. Other than that there is a sweet malt flavor and in the end it bites with some alcohol but it's barely apparent. As it's my first Barelywine I wasn't quite sure what to expect so maybe I'm still trying to figure it out. Overall though I like it. I can taste the alcohol but it isn't a problem at all. I'll probably pick up another sixer just to drink and then age the rest I have. Can't wait to see what this is like with some age on them.","dismal","Feb 18, 2010"

3.88,-6.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"	This American barleywine smells of sweet bready malt at first, followed by a nice plum and fig fruityness, paired with some hints of licorice. There is an overtone of hops throughout. The sweet malt arrives first on the palate and almost instantly turns to a complex blend of fruit, then licorice, then all the complexity of flavor seems to disappear behind a deep hop bitterness. This has much more hop aroma, flavor and bittering than I had expected from a barleywine, this is clearly where English and American styles differ. I should have known to expect a high dose of greenery from the West coast hop heads at Sierra Nevada. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, there is low heat overall. It is a little more unbalanced than the label claims to be. Just as the Brits are subdued which I enjoyed in the Anchor Old Foghorn Barleywine, the Californians bring that extreme American attitude to this beer. I liked this beer, just not at first. As it warms the hop bitterness rounds out and gives way to a sweeter, more stylistic and smooth finish. This is definitely a sipper of a beer. My opinion on the bottle, is one and done. One note is that the hops remained pretty fresh and biting for a Barleywine that is over a year old, must have been stored pretty well as it is the 2008 edition.","Lldeegan","Nov 12, 2009"

Taste kicks like the nose: alcohol, caramel, hops have faded a bit, dark fruits (a bit plumlike). Mouthfeel provides a nice contrast with its creamy smoothness. Much silkier than I remember this beer being with a fullness to it that is hard to come by.

When drinking this beer I was amazed at the complexity of the flavors I experienced. Although outright impact on the taste bud's in the intense flavor of hops (having 90 international bitterness units), the beer is surprisingly well balanced by the malt. The flavors were so rich this beer seemed almost chewable. The aroma was filled with the resinous smell of hops, and then topped off with a bit of sweet malty and fruity character. Though the alcohol content was close to 10 percent, the alcohol taste was not overpowering at all and the drinkability of the beer was quite good. It poured a beautiful clear reddish-brown and had a nice fluffy head in my chalice. This is one of my favorite examples of the American barleywine style ale. Its almost as good as Stone's Old Guardian, but falls just short of that in my opinion. I would like to age some of these for a while at home and then see how it effects my view on this brew, although I already think it is great with out any aging. I've never seen these in 22 oz. bottles, but it would be cool to see some of them if there are any because buying a six pack of this type of beer feels weird to me.

4.6,11.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"5 D: this is my first-ever bottle of American barley wine, and it's incredibly delicious as well as surprisingly balanced. It's so different from those English barley wines I've tried which tend to taste "older" and mellower. In a sense, it bears much resemblance to other types of American ales maybe thanks to the bulk of strongly-scented hops used in this ale, even reminding me of some fantastic characters of SN's own Celebration Ale, but of course this one is of different type. Overall, this is a good digestif to replace a vintage port for me this winter. Though it's not something to savour for more than one bottle, I think the "drinkability"--overall performance, satisfaction vis-a-vis expectation--is sublime. I shall buy some more bottles for ageing and see if it indeed improves with age like a port~~","wl0307","Jul 27, 2009"

There was also a caramel and toasted malt flavor in there somewhere when I took my first sip, but by know the hop flavor is too ingrained in my taste buds to detect anything else other than pure hop juice.

The liquid portion of the image is a chameleon changing with the light, brown, burgundy, red, and quite clear...limpid. I love this beer. Distinct hops, and malts sweet and grainy and fruity, define the nose. I really don't have the palate to do the beer justice...I'll try, again and again. Wonderful mouth feel creamy and smooth with carbonation enough to keep it lively. Bigfoot, fresh, has distinct hoppy bitterness, and hop flavors, that work really well with the sweet flavor of malt. There are flavors of caramel and fruit, sweet caramel and fruit. The hoppiness and carbonation help the beer to not be cloying, each sip makes me want another.","Sanford","May 26, 2009"

Great initial flavors, although alcohol is definitely present - caramel, brown sugar, some earthy tones with a slight hint of maple...hops then take over - citrus and pine, but very well balanced. It has a strong bitterness, but the huge malt backbone keeps it in check. I initially served this at about 60º, but as it warmed, it got even better.

It smells like ether, and floral aromatic hops. In fact it smells much more alcoholic then it tastes, the hop characteristics hide the 9.6% alcohol by volume. This is an interesting take on a barlywine style, because not only is this beer different than a classic barlywine, its an Ale, and well hopped and balanced as well. Its got a nice smooth mouthfeel but drinkability is a question.

It doesn't have a drying feel because of the otherwise rich chracter and feel, but it made me extremely thirsty after drinking only about 6 ounces. The feel is rather rich, oily and frothy like many other barleywines I've had. Ultimately, the one-note, intense hop bitterness dorwns out everything else.

3.79,-8.5,4.5,3,4,4,4,"Found on tap at The Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine, I couldn't resist trying this after enjoyment from the numerous bottled versions. This poured an orangey amber with a nice full off-white head and similar lacing. The aroma surprised me to seem somewhat non-descript. The usual citrus was not pronounced in this tulip glassful. I did get some mild malt sweetness and a hint of the grapefruit, but I found it odd that the this would be less impressive on tap, and unfortunately the taste followed suit. The flavor matched the aroma with the addition of that familiar bubblegum overtone. It had nice medium bodied creaminess with decent small bubble carbonation and was decidedly drinkable but this just didn't strike me the way bottle Big Foot has always managed to impress me. I wondered if maybe the taps here at the Bear were less than perfect in delivering this fine brew.

4.45,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Notes: Michael Jackson called this beer "perhaps the world's hoppiest barley wine", and although I haven't tried very many barleywines I am inclined to agree. This is definitely not a beer for the faint of heart or the faint of palate, and if you haven't gotten your palate accustomed to the deliciousness that lies within intensely hoppy beers this probably isn't a good starting point. To those that are ready, however, Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot is a rich, thick, and exceptionally flavorful and full-bodied barley wine that is hard not to love. A real ass-kicker of a beer, Bigfoot is something to be sipped and savored.","johnmichael712","Mar 30, 2009"

Maybe it's just my particular bottle, but once the head had gotten to about one finger of thick foam, it never dissipated. Sticky lacing is left everywhere in its wake. The smell is complex. Great, pure hops are the first thing on my nose. Grapefruit and pine with a pure fruit presence and lightly sweet malt. The taste is every bit as complex. Hops bitterness is strong but the flavors it brings out are glorious. Underlying is the malt, adding a bit of caramel sweetness. There's a certain earthiness to this brew as well, and light biscuit toastiness with some subtle fruit flavors round it out. One of the most balanced brews I've ever tasted. I can't stress the purity of the hops; I'm picturing raw, young, green buds right off the plant. By the by, this claims 9.6% ABV and I can barely tell as an aftertaste. Impressive.

Smells strongly of hops, floral, piney and with some candy-like sweetness just behind it. The flavor follows the smell in that the hops are at the forefront in a big way, to the extent even of an IPA on the first few sips. But there is a sweetness behind it which grows as the beer opens up a bit and settles towards room temperature.. This isnt so much a malty sweetness but sugary and a bit fruity. Its very complex but its sort of a journey (like searching for a sasquatch) in that you have to search for it a bit. The mouth is moderate with sort of a full body and prominent, crisp carbonation. Its refreshing though it almost approaches syrup-like quality in the sweetness. This brings down its drinkability a bit. Overall its great, but its very "big" in a lot of ways.. the floral aspect is really out at the forefront and I could stand the hop character brought down a pinch, but it becomes much more complex as you get through it.","BirdFlu","Mar 24, 2009"

The one-finger head was beige, the retention good and the lacing consistent. The aroma was notably sweet, a mix of caramel malt, sweet malt, toasted malt, floral hops and some bitter herbal hops. The flavors were delicious. I tasted caramel malt, toffee, brown sugar and some notes of dark fruit balanced by bitter hops and citrus hops. In general I thought the balance was excellent and the sweetness concealed the high alcohol percentage very well. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation on-point for the style.

Poured a translucent, but slightly hazy, mahogany with a dense, half inch, off-white head; bands of lacing were revealed as it slowly receded. The glass must have a nucleation point etched in it, because a spiral of tiny bubbles gently swirled up to the underside of the cap. Potent nose - could smell it from eight inches away. Aromas suggest hops, dark fruit and maybe some toffee or caramel in the mix. Hops hits you right in the face on the first sip before revealing the characteristics implied by the nose and then finishing with a lingering, medicinal bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel was slightly more than medium-bodied, with a mild viscosity and a subtle, but consistent background effervescence that adds a liveliness to the brew. Also detected a little alcohol heat, but it wasn't clearly revealed in the flavor profile. Wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this brew.

A nicely subdued degree of carbonation A stickey, resiny residual mouthfeel. A barleywine, of course, is intended to be filled with alcohol, and its presence is well known here, but not overwhelmingly. A nice balance of dark sweet malt, hops and alcohol.

Lots of citrus overwhelms the olfactory senses but beneath that frontal assault of hops is a really mellow sweetness coming from what has to be an absolute ton of malt since it was able to sneak out from under the hops. The taste is equally great. Huge hops muddled with a big malty backbone. This is what I've always thought a barleywine should taste like or at least I always wanted it to taste like.

Seems to be surprisingly all-seasonable- drinking this in front of a woodstove monitored with too much vigilance has left me with a distinct annoyance with the heat, and this beer is borderline thirst-quenching, probably the last thing any barleywine ever could say it was.

Lots of dark rum soaked fruit with pine sap drizzled over top. This is one big beer. Alcohol can be detected throughout, from nose to throat, but it's all a part of this beer drinking experience. It's damn tasty, but I don't want more than one at a time. This is an excellent Barleywine, and probably the standard for American Barleywines.

I'm not really picking up any malt characteristics, at least in the aroma. As far as I've read this fits the styleof an American Barleywine. So far this beer is wetting my palate and I'm really hoping not to be let down. Mouth feel is really smooth and crisp, with an associated dryness of higher alcohol content. There's a low carbonation level. The first taste is the alcohol, then the hops hits, and then some tartness is present in the aftertaste along with a little sweetness.

The foam is fairly resilient, only dying down after a couple of minutes and leaving a light coating and some brilliant lacing. Smells more akin to an IPA than a barleywine; floral cascade hops dominate, giving it that signature SN bouquet. As it warms, sweet malt with hints of molasses and raisins peaks through. Sharply hoppy upon first tasting, with quite a bit of grapefruit coming through. Sweet, boozy malt is faintly evident after the palate gets acclimatized. Bitter, warming finish. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, though verging on syrupy. Not terribly drinkable, at least for me; the hops are overpowering and the alcohol is pretty noticeable.

The smell of piney hops hit me real quick, but I could later detect some spices and malts. Quite a complex smell, but unbalanced toward the hops. Despite the aroma, I was still a bit surprised on my first sip. It seemed to taste more like an IPA rather than a barleywine as the beer was more bitter than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (not that it's a bad thing). Once my palate was used to the hops shock, I was able to taste much more of the beer. The beer is initially chocolaty and malty and the hops slowly take over the taste. There is a warming feeling as you drink this beer that gives me the sense that I'm drinking whiskey. However, I cannot taste any alcohol in the taste. The beer is carbonated nicely and appears to be near the perfect thickness. This beer is also very drinkable, but I prefer to have no more than one at a time. It just seems you are missing out on the beer if you follow up with multiples. Overall a decent barleywine, and I'm glad I got my hands on this beer.","Jablonski","Jan 22, 2009"

I thought that would relax after months, but it is still the initial flavor that hits you. The after taste is good becuase the hops finally starts to drop and you get the smooth sweetness of the barley to shine through. The beer isn't entirely that drinkable. It is too hoppy.

There was a vast hoppy aroma in my glass, with good traces of different type malts (i.e. chocolate, coffee in 2nd) and for a second I thought I had found a bourbon cask bottle on the cheap. There were some roasted malt flavorings, or at least some chocolate, coffee and hazelnut mixed in with caramel and/or honey on top of hops, so this beer had an extremely noticeable hop bite but was very tastey and very smooth. The only thing that limited its drinkability was the ABV being over session beer limit. I mean, this was a damn smooth beer, syrupy even, with malts all over the place that went down fine and it is inexpensive. On top of the hops and malts there were hints of citric fruit w/ other minimal flavors and I wish I would've bought more.","clayrock81","Feb 29, 2008"

Hoppy beginning with a sharp hop bitterness in the form of dry aspirin like medicinal bitterness. Some cherry cough drop like flavor along as well, but mildly so.

Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a nice looking cherry color. Besides the color, it looks slightly dull, with not much head save for a tiny ring around the glass. Aroma is a slight improvement, with some great berry and cream characters backed by a heavy perfume of booze. Taste begins with a huge assault of hops, a bit of juicy dark fruit, then leaves on an intensely bitter note that reminds me of cheap tobacco. Aftertaste is rather unpleasant. Reminds me of the taste in my mouth after a harsh night of drinking mixed with bad cigarettes. Mouthfeel is heavy on the palate, and drinkability is lessened quite a bit by the rough aftertaste. Quite a disappointment in my book, as other years of this brew have been very enjoyable. I suspected maybe I had a poor bottle, but found the same flaws present in the second bottle I cracked open. I don't think I will be drinking the rest of my six pack at this point, so maybe I will lay a few down to see if they mature well. Simply a mess of a beer IMO. Avoid.","jamie2dope","Feb 19, 2008"

The drinkability is very good on this brew, and I would gladly purchase again.","TheodorHerzl","Feb 08, 2008"

I do feel this taste could be stronger though in general.

Good looking head, with some sticky lacy residue left behind as the beer recedes. Smells hoppy, like a lot of nice IPAs I've had before. I know the SN brewing company is known for hoppy seasonals, but I had no idea their barleywine style would be quite so complex in the hop factor too. Well played, SNBC... well played. The taste is genuinely hoppy, with a crazy strong malt character built in. Lots of fruit here too, but it's almost too heavily masked by the hop content. I love this flavor, but I think it would be just as good if it were a bit milder. Mouthfeel is hefty. I'm not sure this is a very drinkable beer for several different reasons. It appeals to a certain beer drinker, and that's just fine with me because I am that certain type of beer drinker, but it's not an accessible beer by the masses. It can't be.

Pours a moderately-hazey copper-amber in color, with ample yeast settling to the bottom of the glass. Hops are *very* expressive on the nose, with a sort of buffet-table of bitterness and floral hop qualities. Earthy, both in the hops and malt qualities . . . almost smells 'dirty', like the roots of a plant being transplanted. Vegetal qualities are underlying the floral and citric hop notes, and there are a number of fruit notes here too: ripe plum, raisin, fig, and of course anise/licorice. Some diacetyl, but on-style. Licorice and hop bite/bitterness are al over the first sip, followed by a rounding plummy, toffee quality, and a bit of butterscotch. Even after just a sip, there's a sincere alcohol presence in this one - this brew means business! Notes of apple (red and green) in the aromatics, which play nicely with the floral hops (if I said I detect cherry blossoms here you wouldn't accuse me of floral prose, would ya?) Bitterness is very pronounced, and an aquired taste, but is on-style; very par for the course as per my Bigfoot reminiscenses. There's a lemony-citric and even minty quality to the hops on the palate, and it's worth noting that this has a rather dry characteristic as it is still rather fresh; age should smooth that out a bit. Some cherry notes in this too, but faint. Body is medium-full, and becomes a bit more round as this warms. Caramel notes sre here about midway through, and really work well with the fresh hops and fruit characteristics throughout (the caramel notes, too, should become more pronounced as this ages over the next couple of years). Full mouthfeel, with nice,crisp carbonation, but not overly carbonated. Despite a considerable heft this is indeed quite drinkable for the style. Worth picking up by the case, Bigfoot really holds up down the line.","Chaz","May 17, 2007"

Well, to be honest, I cannot decide, because this brew is just awesome all around, with different tastes and characteristics to explore when its fresh and with some age to it. Obviously, with aging, you get less hop flavor, which arguably yields a more traditional bareywine flavor, but again, the trademark hop bitterness of this beer is one element of it that makes it the awesome brew that it is. My suggestion is to do what I am doing now, which is by it new (one it's available, of course), try it then (always remember that for best results, a barleywine should be served at cellar temperature), age one for several months, reflect on who it has changed, and then continue to age it longer, which is what I plan to do with my remaining two bottles. I plan to crack the next one opened around October or so, and then the last of the 2008 vintage around the beginning of the 2009, to see what a beer aged for one full year tastes like.

Still a huge citrus and pine taste but I wouldn't describe it as much as a hops blast as previously. Noticed a slightly oily aftertaste and mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is still incredibly rich.

The smell is all hops up front. A lot of grassy and resinous hop aroma is experienced, the hop aroma is so thick you can almost taste it. The taste itself is also very full of hops. The copious hop flavors hit first along with a strong bitterness. Then a touch of sweetness comes through followed by a bit of alcohol and the warmth associated with the alcohol. For a beer with a bitterness this high it is surprisingly well balanced. The mouthfeel is very full this beer tastes thick and coats the mouth well. Like many big beers drinkability is only good you need to take it slow with this one or the bitterness will just tear your mouth apart. I'm probably more a fan of English style barleywines but this isn't bad I'd definitely like to see how this one ages if my willpower proves strong enough to let a few sit for a while.","fank2788","Mar 15, 2007"

In the nose I get a wealth of pine and citrus, with notes of vanilla and toasted malt. Alcohol sits in the background. When I first had Bigfoot about a year and a half ago, I thought it was over-the-top bitter, which it still kind of is, but now I can taste more than just an assault of hops. What I thought was once disgusting because of the hop character now just seems kind of all over the place with toasted malts, pine resin, and a finish that's both oily and overly sweet with a bitter that doesn't really balance out the sweet, so much as it conflicts with it. The beer is decent, for sure, but it's nothing I could get worked up over. Mouthfeel is full and mellow, but a bit slick for me. I don't have much interest in drinking this.

Much more warming and alcoholic than I remember, but not in an off-putting way-- in this context, the booze is adding flavor and character.

The body bears a huge barleywine-style malt tribute, making for one thick beer. Sweet, and a bit sticky too. Worlds apart from the British Old Nick types; they only have the big malt body in common, but even they are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Picture a hoppy ale, then distill it once, dry hop it to smithereens...e.g. Bigfoot ale. The hoppiness is what I love about this beer; pure fruity bitterness. As big as this beer is, it actually hides the alcohol quite well. Give this to a teenager and it may scare them away from beer forever. Cheers!","rayjay","Feb 25, 2007"

Smell is extremely floral with a some pine and maybe even a bit of soapiness - I like it though. Taste is hops, hops, and more hops with some grapefruit rind in the finish (there's an initial sweetness that gets slaughtered quickly by the hoppiness). Some aging would definitely tone this down. Mouthfeel is nice, almost chewy - the carbonation lends a nice crispness. Even though this is super hoppy, it is quite drinkable as a sipping beer. This is one to be savored.

4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As soon as the beer evacuates from the bottle into my goblet, an immediate kick of grassy hop aroma smacks the snotty crust off of my face, buttressed by a substantial malt foundation (rum-bloated raisins, warm cotton candy). The hops, once I dig my nose into the brew, become more complex than simply "grassy" -- they're huge here -- an entire landscape of freshly peeled citrus rinds and cut grass, pinches of pine resin -- huge -- along with a mild flash of alcohol heat. The color's a translucent russet, has a sheen to it; the head's at least an inch tall, tan, and deflates slowly leaving curdled swaths of lace on the goblet walls. The taste opens from the periphery of my palate, for a split second, before the onslaught of hop bitterness caves in at a deliberately massive pace, like sucking on a thick wad of liquor-drenched grapefruit rinds that still have a bit of flesh, juice, adhered to them. The middle brings out the malts; they press through, in thin ribbons of caramel and prune, deep from the underbelly of the hop tsunami that's so intense even the roof of my mouth feels numbed. Mind you, this is entirely pleasurable to me. Bigfoot is violently sodomizing my mouth! I look forward to it every year.","RootedFool","Feb 11, 2007"

An explosion of fresh and piney hops with a backnote of grapefruit and a solid dry malt background. There are also notes of bitter orange and an undefinable meaty taste as well. Delicious.

The aroma was a mixture of bitter hops and alcohol fusels - remnds me of a sweet brandy. The taste matured from last spring, as the hops mellowed quite a bit, but not enough. This was like drinking a bitter brandy. Way too much alcohol up front, along with very Cascade hops(grapefruit, pine solvent bitterness) dominated the entire brew. Way out of balance. One positive thing about to say was the strong malt base. Even though it couldn't quite keep up with the hops, a sweet toffee like taste could be detected- thanks to the near perfect carbonation. While this is a hopheads dream, I find it a bit too much, if not poorly constructed. If I wish to drink grapejuice soaked pine needles, I go make it myself. Perhaps another 2 years in the cellar would have helped, but I doubt it. The overpowering bitterness is here to stay. Not intended to be a session beer.

Fairly bitter but none of the "fresh" hop bitterness to it that it has when new. Seems like the alcohol comes out as the years go by. Astringent,sort of dry mouthfeel to it.

Smell and taste are both very malty, lots of caramel character, and though chocolate malt is not used, the combination of malts gives a hint of it in the smell and taste. Since this is almost a year old, I guess the hops have calmed down a lot because I don't detect an amazing amount of hoppiness like others say is present when the beer hasn't aged. The malt is king in this beer. Dark grapefruit aroma and taste is also present. Very full-bodied and a very complex taste. The alcohol content is masked very well - it's a strong beer and it tastes strong, but not of strong alcohol, of strong malt. This one drinks pretty easily, you probably won't finish it as fast as other beers, but you'll be able to drink a few more of them afterwards.

Very different from the last barley wine I had which was an english style and much more malty. But this is from the west coast so what do you expect? I could drink two or three of these no problem.

The finish is very bitter and long with plenty of lingering warm alcohol. It has a medium body, slightly chewy texture and has moderate-lively carbonation. This is a flavor explosion and a must try.

Moderate carbonation with a full body and creamy texture. There was a bit of warmth in the finish as well. This is sinful on tap. The malt and hop combination is classic. Plus, it seems to have smoothed out nicely with a little age. What a treat!","DrJay","May 20, 2006"

Aroma - instantly noticeable alcohol- some piney citrus and doughy caramel. Taste- intensly sweet and bitter at the same time- very intense- at first, the hops and malt compete briefly, fighting for your attention, citrus and caramel, then two sides of the flavor equation (hops vs. malt)seem to cancel each other so that alcohol asserts itself over the two - leaving a biitersweet aftertaste following an alcohol burn. Mouthfeel - very full mouth, little carbonation, slick coating, and small alcohol burn. Drinkability- this is very good, but very rich, could handle two in one sitting (maybe three if I wasn't driving) then would need to have something much less rich and smaller abv. As for the alcohol burn; this ale is good enough as to make it tolerable, moreover I suspect that the burn diminishes with age (cellering) as the ale's components mellow and hence integrate with each other rather than compete, much the same way it does with wine (this being my first barleywine experience) -this is vintage 2006.","ultralarry2006","Mar 31, 2006"

Lurking behind, however, is a pretty robust sweet malt backbone to offset the hop attack just a tad. Smells wonderful. Palate is as suspected. The hops jump out and grab you like a pissed off yeti. As the nose indicated, the substantial malt character really does work to "tame" the massive hop profile this one contains. Pine, green tea, and a little citrus mixed with sweet mollasses and caramel. Mouthfeel is biting and sweet, Again, low carbonation. Lasting bitterness of the hops co-exist with a persistent sweetness. Medium-bodied. Wow ...what can I say ... I've wanted to try this one for a while now and it didn't disappoint. I was a bit worried as this is the '06 Bigfoot and still very "young." The hops are indeed "untamed" and are a force to be reckoned with. All in all, though, this is still very drinkable (one), and promises even better things in a couple of years. The rest of the six is goin' in the cellar and won't make another appearance for a year, at least. By then, it'll have learned a little discipline. Anyway, as for the Bigfoot ...

The finish has a brawny hop presence, intermediate acidity, aftertaste is dry, alcohol bitter and the high ABV is certainly evident in the "Belly Warming".

Pungent hop flavor with lots of sweet caramel maltiness too. Although the sweetness is there, the taste left behind in the mouth is very bitter.

The alcohol character became a liitle oppressive and despite all the fascinating complexity this beer developed, I felt its drinkability declined severely.","JudgeRoughneck","Mar 08, 2006"

The hops stand out right at the beginning--citrusy and piney, but it is followed with a pretty good malt kick. It tastes just a little nutty. The most notable thing about this one is the big kick of alcohol in the mouthfeel though the taste is only minimal-giving it a little fruity taste.

Dark copper in color and a head that can be incited to stand but will soon diminish to a lacing. This beer is one of the strongest in terms of ABV I've had and I can't even taste the alcohol because of the hops. As far as I'm concerned, every bit of hop bitterness is needed to balance the otherwise cloying sweetness.

Leaves lacing all the way down the glass, which is very unexpected for the style. Smell is almost all hops, and I'm not talking the nice citrusy hops that I love. Pure pine needles. There is actually some caramel malt smell underneath everything, just barely. Unfortunately it doesn't show up in the taste. At first the hops bite hard. Like eating pine needles. Then you wait for the initial hop bite to subside and for the malt to smooth things over...and you can wait all day if you want, but it never happens. The finish is even worse - it's pure bitterness. There is absolutely no flavor that lingers in the mouth, just bitterness, and linger it does! Mouthfeel is actually pretty good. Nice and thick and creamy like I like my barleywines. Right now I don't care how good this will taste in 10 years, it's nearly undrinkable at the moment.","PatYoda","Sep 24, 2005"

No complex aged components yet, but it still carried a good bit of IPA hops.

The taste was very reminent of a strong IPA with the hop bitterness shining through. I would have liked a little more of malt presence to balance out the hops with some sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent, but a little rough so far. This beer is much better after laying down for a couple of years.

Presented a murky dark brown with a ragged light brown head clinging to itself in some places and spilling down the glass in other places. Smells dark and citrusy. Almost grapefruit pith, but not quite...perhaps a hint of pineapple mixed in there? Sweet is less noticable than the hops and consists of caramel and some brown sugar/molasses. Taste starts sweet (momentarily), but then comes the hops, bolstered by an playful alcohol. Citrus hop bitter rises above the caramel and rock candy sweetness to become almost edgy. Low co-humulone is good, because it keeps this one from going over the edge. The finish is hop citrusy, complimented by the bitter and alcohol to leave my mouth dry. Hop flavor is mostly grapefruit pith, some tangerine and also a touch of sour (not quite plum-skin sour, and certainly not cherry sour). Thick bodied and mildy carbonated. I was concerned that, fresh, the hops would be a bit too much and the malt a bit unrefined.

Mouthfeel is creamy with an almost sherry like texture. Extensive lacing is left behind by this deep copper, opaque nectar. The alchohol is very present in the taste making no attempt to hide itself. The balance of hoppiness and maltiness is outstanding after aging. The hops grab your attention first, followed by the maltiness, then finally the bitterness of the hops asserts itself again.

Good staying power as the head sticks along for the ride. Big hop aroma with floral and pine notes galore. As it warms a bit some of the sweet malt and alcohol peak through that massive hoppiness. The flavor starts with a bit of sweet malt before the huge dose of hops comes through. Citric and earthy hops provide a good amount of bitterness though notably less than previous years. Some alcohol notes but very light. A little bit of sticky fruit sweetness. Bitter aftertaste finishes this. Excellent. Mouthfeel is full and creamy while giving your tongue a light hop raking. Very drinkable this year as well. Also an well priced beer for the style. This is definitely blurring the lines between Double IPA and Barley Wine. I like mine fresh but it is still great after several years. Either way its one awesome brew I will be getting plenty of each year.","meathookjones","May 10, 2005"

The taste is a immediate assault of hops on the tongue, backed up by a thick malty body. I can't wait to try it again after it ages a year or two... If I can wait that long.

The beer is not quite cloudy but some sediment is floating around. The only scents are alcohol and hops, granted, the hops are significant (grassy, grapefruit, pine, a bit of tropical fruit, and I can almost smell the bitterness). Taste delivers more alcohol and an assload of hops. The predominant flavors are hop oils, pine, and grapefruit, but they are so strong I can only detect the malts in the mouthfeel. It is very thick and coats the mouth well with a bitterness that lingers forever. However, this bitterness is very intense (...coming from a hophead) and even though the IBUs (90) aren't as high as other beers I've had, the lack of enough malts to balance them make it seem like the most bitter beer I've had. I like my hoppy brews, but I was expecting more malts - this seems more like a dark double IPA than a barleywine. There's no way I could drink more than 2 in a night.

It poured copper in color without any significant head, but there was a thin film on top of the beer. The aroma is purely of malts and hops. The flavor made me think of crab grass, ery sour with a spicy bite. But not sweet spices like other barley wines I have partaken of, but pepper and cumin. More spicey spices. A lot of really good cooking recipes (or so I think at least) come to mind as I drank this beer. The mouthfeel was fairly crisp but there was a very present alcohol burn.

4.22,1.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"2004 vintage. Poured a clear red that was very rich in color with a white head that lasted for an amazingly long time for a brew of this gravity.The aroma was very nice with a strong hop aroma that seemed a blend of pine and citrus. The taste was excellent as a strong hop presence was immediatly made which segued smoothly into a sweet carmelized malt flavor and finished with a lingering hop flavor and an alcoholic warmth. This ale seems like it recieved a full amount of aging and the yeast finished this beer very cleanly. The body complements the alcohol wonderfully as it is viscous and the light carbonation provides a touch of carbnic bite which offsets the sweetness of the malt and the differently assertive hops flavor. Very drinkable I try to save some of this every year but it rarely makes it through the summer.","RenoZymurgist","Jan 03, 2005"

4.37,5.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"2004 batch. This beer pours a very hazy dark reddish brown. About a half inch of bubbly head on top, though it doesn't leave much lacing to speak of. Quite aromatic... hops up front but also a big presence of ripe fruits like apircots and pears. Bigfoot is certainly an appropriate name for this brew. Big all-around flavorful taste. A grapey sweetness hits the palate first, folowed by more fuity malts and finished with a piney hop bitterness. A lot of beers seem to put the hop taste out front, but I like that bitterness as sort of an afterthought in this beer. This beer is a perfect example of a well balanced beer. It's not too over the top in any particular feature, but it's extremely flavorful and has a wide variety of complex tastes to be sought out by the drinker. Exellecent smooth and full mouthfeel. Although a lot of people generally give these bigger beers a fairly low drinkability score I think this is a very drinkable beer, as long as you can handle the %10 ABV. Personally, I feel up to the challenge!","twelvsies","Nov 16, 2004"

Poured into a big wine goblet (it's wine, right?!), the tan head quickly diminished into the beautiful hazy reddish-copper liquid below. I couldn't stop taking whiffs of this beer. It smelled divine. All of the following were detected by my mere novice nose: sweet caramel malts, sour and dark fruits like raisins and cherries, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, honey, pepper and spices, bourbon and with a big enough sniff, straight up alcohol (how's that for a bouquet?). I dove right into it to find extremely complex tastes... it seemed that right off the bat, my taste buds experienced a candy-like sweetness that was almost immediately punched in the face by a powerhouse of spicy, bitter hops. It's a pretty amazing taste experience. The finish is so, so bitter but eventually I warmed right up to it (literally). Tastes included raisins, tangy and sour fruits, toffee and grapefruit (typical of Sierra Nevada). The mouthfeel is absolutely incredible... extremely smooth but thick and chewy with just enough carbonation to keep your taste buds from falling asleep. Drinkability... well, I'd definitely have another but not in the same session. This is an amazing beer that allegedly gets better with a little age. Apparently, its hoppiness mellows out over time and for someone like me, that's a good thing.","oxmasterscream","Aug 17, 2004"

The hazy copper red appearance with a steady carbonation that fed a generous head that left oodles of lacing while dissipating made this is one beautiful looking beer. The initial aroma was a wave on piney cascade hops that nearly singed my nostrils. Deeper sniffs revealed layers of caramel malt, vinous and spicy alcohol, and ripe tropical fruit. The taste was sweet plums, raisins, chestnuts, caramelized sugar, and grapefruit that softened up the palette up front for an unrelenting assault of hop bitterness and peppery alcohol zing that lingered long after each sip. Surprisingly, the finish on the beer was again quite sweet, with a toffee like aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy and quite soothing despite the dance of flavors going on in the mouth. This is one marvelous brew that should improve tremendously with age. Although I did not have the patience to save the one bottle I acquired this year, come 2005, I will surely be jumping all over this one when I see it.

It's thick and wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of the barleywine style, but this one is pretty damn amazing. Mouthfeel is thick and coating.

I don't find this to be a very drinkable beer. The only times I've found it to be satisfactory is when I wanted a large volume of alcohol or on the end of large volume of beer.

Bigfoot pours a nice dark slightly cloudy reddish brown with a very nice head with good lace. The smell is equal parts hop and malt with just a touch of alcohol to tickle the nose. As the ale hits your tongue the warming and molasses like malt flavors dominate and then there is a hint of the alcohol sweetness only to be followed up by the hop bitterness and citric flavors. Good full body and carbonation also enhance this beer. All in all a very good barleywine, especially for one so young.

It also left a nice curtain of lacing. Very clear for the style IMO. Not a bit of yeast floating around in there, very unlike some others, such as DFH's Olde school barley wine. The smell was excellent, piney, hoppy and solvent alcohol. All enhanced by the fact that I was drinking it from a snifter I suppose. The taste was excellent as well. Much more hoppy than I expected. Big oily bitter hops no less, right upfront. Balanced by the piney flavor and equally big sweet malt backbone. Very well balanced. More so than Victory's Old Horizontal. The finish was warming alcohol that seemed to evaporate out of your nostrils. The mouthfeel was nice too. Velvety smooth, although more carbonated than I expected, and a tad filling. The filling feeling is the only reason I didn't give it a 4.5 on drinkability. The taste is there, but as with all big beers, I would probably not session with this brew.

The flavor hard to grasp -- some woody hints, some hop indications, a bit of malt sweetness -- but overall the experience was more like an IPA than a Barleywine to me.

The hops dominate the aroma, Citrus, dark fruit, pine, alcohol, and a nectar like quality are all in the nose. Thick bodied, with a slightly syruppy consistency. The taste is sweet with American hops bursting forth all over the place. A strong malt character (caramel, biscuit) is here, but it is definitely subservient to the hops in this fresh example. The malt only serves as a vehicle to allow the hops to express themselves to the fullest.

The taste is earthy, a coniferous forest in spring with a slight hint at alcohol, nice aftertaste which lasts forever, but is a bit astringent. Medium-bodied. While this is very bitter, it's also pretty sweet and a little sour from overhopping. I'd definitely like to try this aged a bit to complexify the flavors a bit, but young, this is one big hopheads beer, therefore not exactly my bag. Quite citric even for an american barleywine.

A little grapiness around the edges, just a hint of whats to come. As it warms, alcohol definately takes over, but by the time this happened, I was nice and warm, and didn't let it bother me. Full bodied mouthfeel, oily, but not bad. clingy. Drinkable yes, in large quantities, no. I understand why Foghorn comes in smaller bottles, besides the obvious marketing ploy, 7-8 ounces is really all I need, after that, it just tasted like alcohol anyway. Also, I probably should let this age a while as well. I really think this will be very tasty with some aging. Hops was just a little too dominant right now. Another six months maybe?

Notes of figs and currants open up, as well. Even in this almost two year old version, the raw hop presence hardly fades, while the malt becomes more complementary and sweet. The alcoholic burn on the finish lingers, but not as much in more youthful versions. Mouthfeel is viscous and oily, yet round and appropriately carbonated for an aged draft offering.

Great aroma of lots of sweet caramel and fruity malt with a slight hint of alcohol. Only a small touch of spicy hops to the aroma. Color is deep copper-brown and slightly hazy. A large amount of carbonation can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, yet theres only light carbonation on the tongue. The palate is similar to the nose with a good deal of caramel and fruity malt sweetness. The alcohol which is quite obvious is in no way awkward in its tendency to stand out. Instead, it melds with the other flavors only adding to the overall experience. Decent hop bitterness picks up toward the end to perfectly balance out the sweetness from the start. Theres a little roastiness to the finish and aftertaste which lingers for quite some time. Easily the best barley wine Ive had to date, and Ill certainly be looking for this one again.","byrd","Nov 12, 2003"

Taste and mouthfeel is of thick warm caramel melting across tongue, surrounded by a thick layer of hops to curb the sweetness, and pull it across the line to the bitter side of town.

It's full of deep invigorating piney hops wrapped in maple syrup that are acting like pheromones, making me fall in love with this beer. The taste is one huge assault of malts and hops. The hop resins send shots of bitterness across my palate and the wave of malty sweetness of figs, raisin, and syrup sweep through finishing the flavor. Mouthfeel is syrupy fullness one full bodied west coast hop monster presenting the oily resins in the mouthfeel very nice.

Their Barley Wine (style) Ale provides an inviting appearance with a robust brown color featuring ruddy highlights, as well as a complex aroma that includes scents of pepper and orange. An odd scent, which transcends as hoppiness in the flavor, is probably attributed to the high alcohol content that comes off in its scent and amalgamates into the bitterness of its taste. Therefore, the taste would probably be improved by a long and intense breathing session or storage alone, as many advocates have suggested. A chunky mouthfeel doesn't help, culminating in a less than spectacular review.

The head was thick and foamy and fairly large, it was a creamy beige/light tan color as well. It left a full but chunky lace behind that stretched the whole way to the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of flowers (dandelions), hops, pine trees, some malt, light bitey citrus fruit, holly berries and some alcohol. The smells, I noticed, seemed to change in strength as it warmed as well. The tastes were BIG and pronounced. They were of bitter hops, and more hops (seemed to be the leader in this brew), wild flowers (dandelions), earth tones, pine trees, some sweet malt was noticeable but not strongly and seemed to be in the middle of the tongue, some roasted malt, dark plums, and a warmth that came from the 9.6% alcohol. This beer left my mouth, after each sip, with a dry hop taste that seemed to remind me of a dried flower. This beer gets better as it gets warmer, the flavors become more pronounced. I wouldn’t leave it sitting out around the campfire too long of it will disappear. A big beer that sneaks up on you like the elusive bigfoot in the woods, better get a picture or it will disappear and leave you with that feeling that something great just happened.

Aromas were of rum cake, citrus, and scotch pine needles -- a pleasant mix that took me a few minutes to really comfortably place and categorize in my head. Taste was similar. Very light citrus notes up front that get put to rest quickly by an overwhelmingly large hop presence. And that's all that limits this brew as far as I'm concerned.

As the beer breathed and warmed, the dominance of the hops in the smell and taste faded and bit, and the malt resurged to counterbalance perfectly. Much like the smell, the initial taste was one of a strong hop presence, followed by a valiant attack by the malt. Again, with warming and breathing, the flavor became very balance between the malty/fruity sweetness and the puckering hop bitterness. Despite this, the mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied, with a lingering sweetness and hop flavor. Moderate carbonation. Somewhat warming.

It poured a very dark copper color with a great tan color head that lasted quite awhile for a barleywine head. The dominant aromas were of corse hops, and then beneath that was a fruity, floral scent. I let this beer warm a bit before drinking, and the flavor was great. It reminded me of the SN celebration ale, but with way more alchohol and more malty sweetness. As soon as it hits your mouth, you get the blast of hops, then the sweetness sneaks in followed by the warming feeling of the alchohol. As far as barleywines go, this is right up there with Stone's Old Guardian for the best you can get.","Dmann","Feb 27, 2003"

It smells awesome and makes my mouth water just anticipating the first taste! The taste has strong alcohol presence and fades into a citrus hopped smack right in the tasters. The light biscuity and malty taste in the background are nice to be able to detect, but arent as noticeable as they could be or even perhaps, should be. I feel like aging this could make these flavors more balanced, so I will save back a couple bottles for this purpose. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body and unfortunately with the large alcohol presence, the drinkability score wont be what I had hoped. This is still a very nice brew with lots of complexity, yet its unbalanced flavors should come together very nicely with a little more time in the bottle. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 25, 2003"

Thick and kind of syrupy in way, this full bodied brew has some kick! I haven't tried many barleywines yet, but they will probably grow on me. This one wasn't too drinkable to me. I enjoyed the hoppy flavor as it warmed though. The alcohol didn't seem evident for being so high.

The finish and aftertaste is all crisp hops with a constant lingering of the alcohol. This beer has a definite warming effect. I'm not sure what kind of hops are used but they are not really bitter, almost more of a grassy taste.

All of this adds up to a perfect 5 for appearance, not surprisingly. In the nose, there's hop character of impressive magnitude. You can tell it's hopped generously, and with different hop varieties. It's very floral and a bit tree-like overall. The malt backbone is big and strong, offering intense caramel and deep grain up for sniffing. Flavors are just as varied and complex, if not more. A rush of heavy caramel is first in the front with an underlying grain character. Near the middle, the hops come in. Very leafy, oily, and resin-like with a serious, but well-targeted bite of bitterness. Sweetness shows up in the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, just perfect.

It's got quite a bite to it, kind of peppery, but at the same time, there is evidence of some fruit, maybe something citrusy. The mouthfeel is fairly good too.

Raw oily hop resins are the key player here with some additional flavors of bitter grapefruit rind, fresh pine, and a hint of dark fruits. Pretty solid and heavy mouth feel.

Also unlike the others, this one is not overly sweet. Reminds me more of a robust, powerful IPA than the sweet barleywines I have become familiar with. A bit more fruitiness and sweetness shows after a few more drinks, but this is an amazingly balanced beer. (even the "Hop burps" are both sweet and hoppy!) Very nice bitterness on the finish. Can't quite place the type of hops, but it tastes like possibly Liberty or Cascade. The mouthfeel is not as syrupy thick as others. While this hurts my mouthfeel rating a bit, it elevates the drinkability. Even with the high ABV, I could drink several of these. Really a great winter warmer. Perfect for a night when we might be hitting single digits. Or any night that you want a powerful, well balanced beer. On top of the great beer, the label on the bottle is decent as well.

Very, very balanced though so maybe that is why the strong flavors are not shining though entirely(I still gave it a 4.5 on taste, but I expected to go 5.0)..must have a heavy malt load to balance the hops..smooth and easy drinking....the second bottle poured a head like a root beer float (Maybe the first one hit me too hard and I blew the pour)..creamy lace sticks to glass from top to bottom...the best overall barley wine I have had, but not the most intensely flavored..","ZAP","Apr 16, 2002"
5,20.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Heady fruity and spicey and alchoholic aromas.  A very thick malt rush start, then a semi-bitter rind/citrus peel coarseness is abrasive on the palate.  Alchoholic notes.  Complex and overflowing with a rich character.  This has been a very difficult brew to find here in Fresno, CA.","Jordan","Apr 12, 2002"
4.82,16.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"2000 bottling: Pours a clear mahogany with a very slight head. Beautiful bitter hop notes mixed with sweet caramel malt on the nose. This beer is medium to full bodied. It has a nice refined bitterness and hoppiness. Not nearly as over-the-top bitter as fresh samples of this same brew. The malt tones are really starting to show. And they are really nice. Sweet caramel malt. There is still some noticeable alcohol on the palate as well. Don't be fooled however. Even after 2 years of cellaring, this beer is still all about the hops and bitterness.","Bighuge","Apr 04, 2002"
4.55,9.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I just tried the '03 BF and found it to be similar to a young '02. Recently, I've had a chance to sample some leftover '02 Bigfoots and they've aged very well. The hop bitterness is still very much up front, but it has mellowed a bit, as has the alcohol smell and taste. I imagine that the '03 will hold up as well.","mickeymac","Mar 30, 2002"
4.44,7.2,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Hop heads delight,This beer is huge on the nose,by using the four C's of hops minus Columus.Nice copper/garnet in color.The powerful taste goes right along with the nose,rich hops,toffee and a nice balancing sweetness that does a pretty good job of masking the 9.6% abv","sprinkle","Mar 27, 2002"

4.5,8.7,5,5,4.5,4,4,"Beautiful ruby hue w/ good clarity. The thick initial head settles to a modest but creamy and persistent off - white one that leaves lace all down the glass. Gorgeous & appetizing in appearance. Citrusy, piney, bold American hop nose from the four C's (minus Columbus) dominate the nose, but caramel malt, fusels, toffee, subtle fruitiness and a touch of diacetyl add considerable complxity to the aroma. Superlative in all aspects of hops-- bitterness is high but clean, and the hop flavor and aroma is wonderfully assertive. Although the hops hit hard, there is considerable malt complexity & sweetness that contends well w/ the hop profile, but, alas malt does lose in the end. Bigfoot finishes with hop bitterness and a bit of residual sweetness on the tongue, plus mellow alcohol warmth in the throat. Just delicious & intense. There is a wonderful bittersweet taste you get when you lick your lips after each sip. I am satiated and my taste bud receptors are saturated.","marc77","Mar 24, 2002"

5,20.8,5,5,5,5,5,"2004 Vintage (reviewed 3/1/04):The 2004 vintage of Bigfoot pours with a thick creamy, hoppy, head, reaching the top of an imperial pint glass. It fades to an inch-thick head with a lot of staying power. The beer is a deep ruby red. The nose is full of piney, floral hops. Taste is full of oily hops, with a thick body presumably from malt, but I can't taste a bit of it. Maybe a brief malt hint in the aftertaste underneath a boatload of hop bitterness. Scarily drinkable. I'm yet again reminded why I consider this my favorite beer.","ColForbin","Feb 25, 2002"
4.45,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"I had this on draught at one of what has to be the premiere beer bar in Pittsburgh, Fathead's. It poured dark reddish gold with a dense, creamy white head, which I find unusual for a barleywine. The aroma spoke of a hopheads dream exploding with Cascades and  grapefruit. To try and balance this beer must have been a daunting task but Sierra Nevada succeeded in my mind. Toasted malt, apricot, some toffee sweetness over the aforementioned hops and then the alcohol kick. Superb.","QXSTER1","Feb 24, 2002"

4.32,4.3,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"Beautiful winey amber color, exactly how I imagine a barleywine should look. Very hoppy as you may have guessed. I have to say it is actually too abrasive fresh out of the bottle; the hops are overwhelming and the flavors are unbalanced. I can't wait to try it again after I shelf it for a while. Unmistakable trademark Sierra Nevada flavor (read: hops). I didn't have any goblets so I poured it into a brandy snifter - I would suggest not just dumping it in a pint glass. It mellows nicely in the glass. There is something really interesting going on hidden under the hops but it is indistinct at this point. Withholding full judgement until it matures. Buy it now though, it goes quickly. (11 weeks later: Ohh, it's good. I'm kicking the smell up to 5. The smell is AMAZING!)","Thrasher","Feb 19, 2002"
4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"1999 bottling: As I just wrote in my review of the new 2002 Bigfoot batch, I had my last '99 Bigfoot at Christmas, 2001. Very impressive. The cellaring gave the flavor a softness and rounded-ness that more than offset the slight loss of carbonation and head. I've read that the hops flavor is the first to go when one cellars beer, but you couldn't tell that from this brew. Wow!","BKotch","Feb 16, 2002"
4.7,13.5,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"2001 bottling: Something magical has happened over the last couple months. My 2001 has aged and mellowed perfectly. The trademark hoppiness is still there, but is now balanced by just a hint of sweetness (like caramelized fruit). Outstanding. Unfortunately, I have only one left, so I can only hope my 2002's age as well (and I exhibit a bit more patience than I did with the 2001's). I marvel at Sierra Nevada's craftsmanship.","mophie","Feb 09, 2002"
4.06,-1.9,5,4,4,5,3.5,"2001 bottling: Ok I give it this high of rateing with one caveat, and that is it has to age. I my opinion it is the best Bigfoot in the last 4 or 5 years. Sure the hops were too agrressive when it first came out and maybe they still are but it has enough malt going on this year that it will age out to perfection. Another 4 months and I will crack anotherone open. It has the potential to be a truely GREAT beer.","mattmaples","Feb 08, 2002"
4.3,3.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: A deceivingly powerful brew, that is sure to sneak up on you during a session. At 9.6%(abv) and roughly $11 a six-pack this is by far, one of SN's best brews. Find it, buy it and savour it with respectful sips.","BeerAdvocate","Feb 05, 1998"
