3.94,-0.8,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Nice copper color, a little murky looking.  Aroma is a good balance of malt and citrusy hops.  Taste is initially malty and a bit sweet, a little brown sugar.  Hops kick in on the way down, with a pretty strong, but pleasant hop bitterness on the back end.  Good body for the style.  Very enjoyable beer.","stortore","Dec 24, 2014"

3.92,-1.3,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours out a really nice maroon in color with a great two finger white head with good retention and lot's of good lacing. Smell is really sweet with nice candy sugars, lot's of caramel hops that give you great sugar, a little bit a of dark fruits, and a little bit of toffee. Taste is really sweet as one would expect but there is also a little bitter hops that weren't present in the nose that add to the complexity. Really a nice barley wine as there is some balance with the hops that I typically don't see in this style. Mouth fell is really pretty thick that goes with the style. I really like this as there are a lot of things going on here that meld together that I don't typically see in this style. Overall a really big beer that makes me want more as this beer brings balance that you normally don't see in the style.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 03, 2014"

Taste of big caramel, orange zest, pine, biscuit, dark fruit, grapefruit, herbal spiciness, molasses, toffee, and toasted malt. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big caramel, citrus, pine, molasses, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel. At 11.6% this is most certainly a sipper, and I would expect it to be. Good balance of flavors and bitterness; with a nice malt forward profile. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a warming present on the finish.

Taste: dark brown sugar, sugary dates, lemon peel, notes of cherry and red apple. There's a sugared fruit sweetness, balancing bitterness, and a major hit of booze. This is pretty nice, but a bomber is asking a bit much given the upfront alcohol.

The flavor is nicely structured, with piney and citrusy hops upfront, along with plum and fig, some caramel and brown sugar, and a healthy dose of alcohol. The mouthfeel was thick and a tad syrupy, and drinkability was pretty good despite the ABV.

Mainly spruce, lemon rind, caramel, and shortcake, with tons of nuances, some fruit/ berries, some florals. Taste is much fruiter and less sweet than I expected. Big strawberry note up front, then hops and big malts take over. Spruce and lemon linger long in the finish, accompanied by a bit of alcohol burn. I'm still tasting it a few minutes later. This is a full, heavy bodied brew, a meal in itself. Mouthfeel is thick but dry, a little resiny. Lemon rind in the finish seems to emphasize the alcohol burn, which is unfortunate. Maybe a bit more sweetness, like half way to Gravitation (raisin paste), would help. Although it has its flaws and is a little rough in some areas, overall it is another solid offering from Smutty's Big Beer series.","BeerNinja007","Mar 31, 2010"

Fruits and light brown sugar and caramel lots of hints of citrus mid way through finishing with a long lingering orange apricot and bitter hop finish.

As soon as I popped the top, I smelled something warm, sweet and bready. Dipping my nose in the glass, there's a strong aroma of hops: grassy, spicy and fruity with a note of orange peel. It's pretty full bodied, very smooth and slick with a very quick, dry finish. It tastes a little sweet at first; then it gets resiny and finally quite bitter. There are flavor notes of wood, spice and orange peel. It's solidly American and really pretty complex. It kept my attention.","yesyouam","Feb 14, 2010"

Lots of citrus off the nose - oranges, sugar and some aromatic hops come out as the brew warms up a little. Taste is interesting - candied citrus with some light hops bittering coming out at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light and evenly carbonated. An easy drinking beer with a well-hidden abv (too well-hidden - glad I went for the half pour). I have to say though that I prefer the body and malty complexity of English Barleywines over their American counterparts. However, this is a solid brew and well worth trying.

This is malty and sweet yet still balanced by substantial but not overwhelming hop bitterness and flavor. This seemed to get just a bit too boozy at times.

Instead a got an aggressive ass-kicker with an overall character that reminded me a bit of Dogfish 120 (minus the insanely high alcohol).

Looks thick and syrupy on the pour, which yields a deeply murky, dullish amber beer that glows with a "sunburst" effect when backlit. Thin but dense and creamy ecru foam cap. Attractive sheets of clumpy, webby lacing. Blunted hop aromas overtaken by a caramelly sweet character and a dry, ruggedly bitter scent. Smells somewhat oxidized, but nothing unpleasant or inappropriate -- merely a function of having been aged for a year or more. Mellow flavors of brown sugar, alcohol and crystal malt bitterness, a bit of mineral twang, and a slight leafy hop presence. Pleasantly bitter on the rather long finish, which is likely the best aspect of the taste. Full on the palate but feels a bit watery all the same. Tame overall, but I prefer beers that err on this side rather than going too "extreme" and resulting in a gigantic balls-out mess. A decent "beginner's" barleywine.","orfeu","Apr 25, 2007"

It poured into a Rapscallion sniffer glass a lush amber color with nice head retention, and chunks of yeast floating around towards the latter half of the bottle. It also exploded when I first opened it (too much time in the fridge or moved around a bit too much I assume). In the aroma were ripe strawberries, some dried grain, alcohol, and the faintest hint of vanilla. Taste was very rough, though in a good way, with lots of bittering hops, raisins, and more grain. Alcohol was there, but not too heavy. Mouthfeel for this style was medium I would say, and pretty drinkable. Im surprised to say that I killed the bomber easily. This is definitely a Barleywine to sip and savor. At first it seemed a bit harsh, but as it warmed, it became quite the lovely treat. I wish I had a cigar on hand to go along with this one.

Obvious alcohol notes suggest that I'm in for a good night. Herbal, slightly resinous hop backing. Very fruity malt flavors up front with fruit cocktail syrup, pineapples, pears (candied), and brandy. Solid toffee and caramel sweetness in there as well. Bitter (slightly astringent) hop echo throughout. Hops come through as medicinal and herbal in the end. Alcohol is noticeable and warming and a tad medicinal. I really like the big fruitiness up front, but the medicinal character is a little too much. Full-bodied with explosive malt sweetness. Trending toward syrupy.

4.47,12.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Largely clear, ruby in hue with a slight golden-tawny highlight, this has a very attractive color. A dim white head of almost one finger in height topped the beer. The head retention was very good, after a few moments it faded to a foamy cap and then to a collar. Subsequent lacing was minimal, basically nonexistent. At first the aromas were very bold with its fruitiness, like fresh grape juice mixed with a big red wine. This smell was intriguing. As I when back for more I was rewarded with much malty goodness. Man, was it rich! The supple maltiness was lovely, somewhat sweet with a kiss of caramel and a trace of deep toastiness (I cant call it roasty). Thankful that was not the end of the bouquet. The hops came to be after a few moments of sniffing like a fool; they offered a mellow but noticeable hint of citrus rinds. Before the nose concluded raisins, plums, and figs became apparent. The bouquet is mouthwatering and obviously inviting. The potency is louder than moderate and my greedy-ass wishes it was even bigger but, atlas, it is top-notch nevertheless. My bottle is a 2001 Edition, aged in UnionMades cellar (thanks!). This Big Beer still packs one hell of an alcoholic punch. That is both impressive and disappointing. This is quite a flavorful Barleywine, the maltiness is big and chewy. Plenty amble. There are bushels of plums and raisins. Let me not for get the hops, even after a few years they are noticeable and offer modest bitterness and some citrusy-pine flavors. The weakened hops are no match for the big, malty sweetness (which reminds me of a fresh SA Double Bock). This doesnt take in to consideration the alcohol punch. As the beer finish a good belt of alcohol heat/spice blends with figs, chocolate, and plums. There are plenty of flavors going on here and they all fall into the realm of what is considered a Barleywine (as expected). Since this sample as been aged I cant make assumptions about this beer okay, I will anyway. It seems to be an English-style Barleywine with a distinct East Coast influence. Then again, I might be full of it. When this beer is released next winter I think I might have to trade for a fresh sample, for comparison. This beer is really begging to be paired with aged cheddar cheese or smoked Gouda and some seasonal fruit. I think I will heed its request! Ive had many great Barleywines and this is Top-5 material! In retrospect I could have aged this even longer, maybe the alcohol would have hid more and the sweetness would have curbed. Maybe not, this might be as good as it gets. Which is fine by me. Almost full bodied, I mean it is really close to full, the carbonation is low but natural, and the mouthfeel is quite pleasant. Even with the alcohol heat and the 10% abv this is very drinkable, granted I needed to sip and savor but it is drinkable nonetheless. Lovely.

3.32,-16.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Small yellowish khaki colored head that faded quickly to a film. Ruby brown colored beer with an amber tinge. Aroma of sweet malts and alcoholic grapefruit candy. Flowery hops up front right into slick sweet malt. A moderate bodied beer with very light carbonation and a slightly bitter and alcoholic finish that leaves a warm feeling in your stomach. It could have used more carbonation and some bite, too sweet for the flavor.","HappyHourHero","Mar 11, 2004"
4.05,2,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Taste is dominated by the big malty flavors. Big caramel and hints of nut. Alcohol flavors very apparent as well. But the hops stand up to this big body with a strong hoppy/citrusy finish. Big bodied with a bitter hoppy aftertaste that stays with you. A bit sticky. Pretty drinkable for a young barleywine although not as drinkable as, say, SN Bigfoot. You can tell that this one will age beautifully. Let this one alone for a few months and I'll bet it will be even better.","ViveLaChouffe","Mar 10, 2004"
4.43,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured into a snifter, this hazy amber brew smelled sweet and with a hint of citrus fruit. It grew a nice head, which settled and would reappear with a little twirl. The flavors were a mix of fruit flavors, tangerines and raisons with brown sugar sweetness. While the big beer is 10% ABV, there is very little alcohol flavor. The ethanol has a very noticeable presence, sculpting an incredible mouthfeel. The beer has body, but doesn't seem bogged down by any undesirable heaviness. It's remarkably drinkable, and is easily the best of the young barleywines that I have enjoyed this winter.","AllThingsNinja","Mar 08, 2004"
4.35,9.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Enjoyed at room temperature. Its slightly hazy copper body has a ruby cast and displays deep amber highlights beneath a creamy head of ivory foam. Initially the head holds quite well and leaves wide swatches of lace about the glass, but it eventually fades to just a wide but creamy collar and some cottony surface covering. The nose delivers a variety of fruits (without being very specific about any one in particular) and some grassy and citrusy hops over a caramel-drenched maltiness. The body is medium-full with a very fine, natural carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and velvety across the palate. Rich, caramel malt is equally balanced in the flavor by juicy fruitiness, grassy and lightly citrusy hops, and a brisk bitterness. Its alcohol is noticeable within the first few sips, but it never becomes excessive. It finishes dry as its malt and fruit flavor fade quickly but leave its bold bitterness and some leafy and grassy hop flavors behind. Well done and certainly worth trying, but be sure to enjoy this one at closer to cellar temperature to get its full range of flavors.","NeroFiddled","Mar 04, 2004"

3.62,-8.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This barleywine poured with a nice amount of carbonation. Creating a nice light off white head. The aroma is all at once sweet, floral and alcohol. The flavor on the other hand was much more subdued. Just a touch of sweetness at the begining, a stronger hop finish than the aroma fortold and the alcohol does not hit until it lands in your stomach with a rush of warmth.This is a bottle that I put away when I bought it in 2002. I had expected the hop characteristic to mellow somewhat and more fruity flavors to assert themselves.","ybnorml","Feb 11, 2004"
4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a darkish reddish tea colour with an offwhite thin head. The head dissapeared rather quicky and left a think layer of lace. Nose is of dried dark fruits with a carmel hint. Amost like a glaced fruit that was a bit over done. While the taste is a bit like the nose, there is a definate strong hop presence in the beer. It is an interesting sort of dance that the beer does as it goes across the palate. First sweet then bitter with just a final presence of burnt rock candy at the end. It almost had a Belgian type sweetness at the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit thinnner than I had expected, but it could be because the bottle is a year old. There was some sediment at the bottom. Overall it was a nice barleywine style beer that I would certainly try again","TinusTime","Feb 06, 2004"
3.68,-7.3,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Beautifully clear deep garnet hue. Thin, spotty light beige head yields foam wisps. Pungent waft of ethanol heat and burnt toffee hits the nose intially. Mellows promptly, with softer notes of butterscotch and woody, sweet pine like hop ensuing. Esters are of a combined fig and subtle bland pear nature. A touch rough around the edges aromawise. In flavor, the incipient snap of simple medium caramel sweetness is quickly overrun by a barrage of bittersweet, peppery alcohol and assertive, drying hop bitterness. Pronounced nutty, singed biscuit character combvines with the background diacetyl to lend an impression of burnt, bourbon soaked movie popcorn... in a good way. Mellow, but bright ripe strawberry like fruit ester undertone. Expectedly woody hop flavor, but with a citric, lemon rind tinge. Well attenuated and a bit lean in body to support the malt and fruit character. Thinnish, yet syrupy in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is unyielding, and eventually outlasts residual sweetness. Finishes with a brief resurgence of soft caramel, but with fading quinine like bitterness and augmenting ethanol warmth. A tasty barleywine, yes, but not all flavor components coalesce. Regardless, it's certainly a well crafted and ballsy brew. Thanks to Bierman9 for the bomber I've been saving for a while!","marc77","Feb 01, 2004"
4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: I enjoyed my first Smuttynose brew. In addition, on a cold winter night as tonight it warms the bones and gives you a warm fuzzie inside. There are a lot of things going on in this beer. It has a sweet sticky-ness to it and makes you feel warm all over, with a smooth mouth feel. Drinkability is good as long as you can stand the punch of the alcohol. Try it, you will like it!","Stubbie1","Jan 25, 2004"
4.08,2.8,4,3.5,4.5,3,4.5,"Drinkability is excellent. Like I said this isn't a harsh barley wine, but a nice mix. I wouldn't think it was 10% unless I read it. One of the best I have had.","stegmakk","Jan 16, 2004"
3.53,-11.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"pours a nice amber colour with a light tan head that is surprisingly thin and short lived. smells mainly of sweetness and alcohol: carmel, malt, earth and fruit are all detected within. the taste is a more mellow version of the smell, but with a bit of a spice kick to it and a slightly more overpowering alcoholic taste than i would have preferred. whist more in the style of a barleywine than actually a true barleywine (as the label states), it is a more accessible stab at the style than most, but it needs to work on it's blanace of flavours a bit. maybe a bit of aging would do this one some good.","SixpointJMH","Jan 03, 2004"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: A very good effort, and whilst not quite up there with the best of them, its not far behind, it is perhaps a second tier Barleywine when fresh. Maybe a year, or two, in the cellar will improve this one, I think so.","TheLongBeachBum","Dec 21, 2003"

4.57,15.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"A minimal dirty white head leaves nice lacing as it recedes, nice looking slightly hazy amber/ dark honey colored liquid with sparse bubbles slowly fighting their way thru the viscous ale. A very fruity nose with a background dark fruit undercurrent and sweet malt, spicy hoppiness...a hint of what's to come! The taste is a lush, solidly chewy and fruity malt base with a powerfully bitter hop bite that's pushed aside by a warming, brandyish alcoholic warmth. Very light note of phenolic "band-aid" tasted after swallowing. Finishes up rich & very strong, very bitter...powerful and ballsy! This is indeed a hop monster, it almost "out-Bigfoots" Bigfoot, my personal benchmark for the style. A great buy for $2.99 per bomber.","beerluvr","Oct 26, 2003"

There's some nice breadiness in there, and a slight hop bitterness & some alcohol in the finish. Can't help but wonder about these floaties.

3.45,-13.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours deep copper in color, with a good size tan head with quickly receeds to leave small amounts of lace. Aroma is dominated by raw maltiness, but has a good flowery and perfumy hoppiness to back it up. Flavor starts strongly malty (raw grains, some bread), in the middle the hops push through, and ends strongly citric and bitter from the hops, and also has some spiciness thrown in for good measure. Body was full, lightly alcoholic. Seemed a bit "raw" to me, maybe it's too young, but still pretty darn good.","goz","Apr 26, 2003"

The isnt much of an aroma, but I did detect hints of fruit, caramel, and alcohol. The taste is very bold. The alcohol, which is very strong, is the first thing to hit the taste buds. Once you get past that alcohol taste there is a nice medley of flavors with toasted malt and caramelized sugar being the primary ones. There are also some sweet fruit undertones. There was a very slick, oily texture left on my tongue, which seemed to hold the bitter aftertaste in my mouth for a long time. This is an average barleywine, moderately drinkable.","Scooter77","Apr 09, 2003"
