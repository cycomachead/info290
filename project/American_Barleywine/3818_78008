3.84,-5.2,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,"The initial smell that sways my sinuses is one of raisin and a bit of toast. A few more inhales and I also notice a little bit of citrus, I suspect from the Willamette hops. Its color appears as a deep, and slightly cloudy mahogany. Backlit by the sun, it gives off a small red flare midst the brown. My first sip includes roasted malt, a tinge of hops, and more raisins from the nose. Midway through, I also detect vanilla and a little bourbon. It lingers, joined by big wood. [rim shot] No, really, the finish really leaves you with the oak-aged portion of the process. Great sipper. Tiny bubbles and mist-droplet like lacing. I’ve had the regular version of this. I much prefer this one, as it reminds me of Widdershins, but with less oak. Good take on barleywine, without being from across the pond.","JMS1512","Jul 17, 2014"

The nose is almost barleywine all the way, with a hint of oak playing a supporting role deep down under the figs, berries, nuts, light caramel, showing as a touch of vanilla bringing up the rear. Not too much here in the way of hops or specialty malts, but that's how I prefer them anyway. The vanilla comes out a lot more on the palate, while the oak lingers in the finish- a very well-integrated and non-intrusive element. The elegant presentation of well-woven flavors, unfortunately, is marred by an underattenuated quality that dominates all else. Dry this out a touch, and it would do a lot for this beer. Solid effort, but it easily could have been on a whole other level.","TongoRad","Jun 12, 2014"

I like that the oak cuts the sweetness but its just too understated for the brigade of sweetness that attacks the palate. It's like drinking overly sweetened tea. Well put together and easy drinking gives this a bump in points. I read reviews about a strong hop profile so I really want to try a fresh version.","Hopswagger","May 29, 2013"

I have never had the un-oaked version so I don't how it compares but the oak helps this out a lot.

4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/15/2012. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big orange zest, caramel, raisin, molasses, toast, toffee, oak, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate hop and oak balance. Taste of orange zest, caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, pine, oak, grass, and floral earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange zest, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, light pine, and hop earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of deep malt flavors with moderate hop balance; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and moderately full bodied; with a creamy, fairly slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! All around nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate hops; and dangerously smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 15, 2013"

The kicker though, is you are not getting much of the oak in the flavor. Perhaps the oak is working in the background to balance out the often assertive flavors in the style.

I'd had this fresh before, like out bright tank 13 day after brewing fresh along with from the store where it's had a solid amount of hops flavor and aroma which is awesome if not a bit agressive. Aged this beer has mellowed but I don't see it become an elegant after dinner beer like other Barleywine.

Huge sweet oaky nose with hints of caramel, butterscotch candy, booze, vanilla, and toffee. The taste is complex and the oak is once again the star. Nicely complemented with hints of caramel, butter, brown sugar, vanilla, dark fruit (specifically figs), toffee, and just a touch of orange zest, licorice, and coconut. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy but surprisingly smooth with a subtle bitterness and alcohol warming on the finish. With that said, it's really pretty drinkable for a 9.6% ABV beer!

Pours a deep ruby red mahogany brown hue with a cream colored khaki head with fine speckled laicng forming on the sides of my glass. Aroma has oak and vanilla with hints of booze, caramelized sugars with a rolling breadiness. Also in addition there's a subdued earth, citrus pith, and herbaceous flavor combination that gets a bit jaded by the loads of vanilla and charred oak flavors, making the beer a bit dysmal for me. I like Unearthly but not a fan of Oak Aged Unearthly, this is basically the same type of oak flavor, it just doesn't do anything for me that the base beer meant so much.

Well oak, its there actually it kind of takes away from the rest of the aroma. Some good things, balanced hops, citrus, pith, pine, rich caramel like malt, syrupy, sappy. Some bad things, the oak / wood flavor is a bit artificial and wood chip - E tasting. Aside from that I really enjoy the balance of this beer, some A - Barleywines are just too hoppy / bitter and this is nice.
