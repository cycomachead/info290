4.64,2.4,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours a beautiful brown coating with a very thin off-white head that dissipates rather quickly into the abyss of fine barleywine. Aroma gives off a phenomenal smell of pure barleywine - wood,  sweet figs, and slight alcohol. The flavors replicate the aromatic qualities very well along with toffee and raisins. By grace, this is a delicious beer! This is just a tad below Cigar City's Leon, but a cut above Steel Toe's Lunker - both world-class bourbon barrel barleywines in my book! Very impressive coming out of a brewery that is well known for IPA centric beers.","CuriousMonk","Mar 15, 2015"

Figs and raisin play a strong role with chocolate and dark malt presence with berry notes, caramel, and brown sugar in back.  Full bodied with soft carbonation and a very creamy inviting palate.","cpetrone84","Aug 07, 2014"

I think that Alpine Great is not an American Barleywine; rather it is more of a cross between a barrel aged English Barleywine and a barrel aged Old Ale in my opinion. This beer is huge and flavorful; my recommendation is to split a 12 bottle with a friend because 6oz of Great is enough for one sitting.","4DAloveofSTOUT","May 01, 2014"

3.88,-14.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,4,"2013 vintage bottle, poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours a typical dark brown with little to no head at all. In fact, it is almost still. Nose is predominantly bourbon, with some nice dark dried fruit and caramel. Not quite as impressive on the aroma as I had expected. Taste is a follow-through on the nose. Had high hopes for this one, and it is good, but not King Henry good. The mouth feel is essentially flat and thin. Fairly standard, if mild, flavors for the style - bourbon, wood, caramel, figs, etc. Super sweet, with some hints of oxidation. Ultimately, it is lacking all the way around when compared to some of it's peers. Don't get me wrong, I like this beer, but considering the hype, there are far better examples of the style out there (King Henry, Blendiculous, etc). Drink 'em if you got 'em, because this one probably won't age well.","brother_kenneth","Dec 14, 2013"

There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

No real retention or lacing on this one. The beer smells sweet like caramel with a bit of barrel aging on the nose. The hops are a bit hidden on this. The taste of the beer is also sweet with a subtle bitterness in the finish, flavors of caramel and toffee in there with a minimal bitterness. I was hoping to get more of the JD barrel flavors from this but wasn't able too. The mouthfeel is smooth, very dangerous because it's easy to drink.

The initial taste is some sweet caramel followed by some oaky bourbon, marshmallow, toffee, and vanilla. All the flavors come together quite nicely. The finish has a slight alcohol burn, but nothing unexpected given the ABV. Medium-full body. No carbonation. It could use slightly more carbonation, but it is certainly amazing the way it is.

3.95,-12.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Reviewed from notes, back in late June. On tap at brewery into 6oz tulip. No head whatsoever, but has a creamy egg-shell ring. Medium brown color with a grapefruit pink hue. Very refreshing on the nose with a 'great' amount of caramel malt, sweet and salty candies (butterscotch?), with a nice alcohol presence. Taste is very similar, alcohol didn't burn me that much, the caramel and grapefruit came out more. Mouthfeel was decent, a tad too much carbonation for my tastes, as I have always enjoyed smoother barleywines. Still, ABC comes through once again with another magnificent brew.","SDDanC","Jun 22, 2011"

The appearance of this beer is a touch hazy but maintains a nice amber color and actually for the first time in awhile is one of the BA barleywines that has a head on it. The aromatics of this particular beer are heavy with oak and vanilla, but rather mild on the bourbon aspects. This allows for the butterscotch and caramel which reign supreme on the palate of this beer, to come through in the nose as well. There is a background flavor that I actually love when I detect it in higher abv beers. Toasted marshmallow, some have said almond, but I'm sticking with my guns on this one. It really wraps up the flavor on this smooth drinking beer. Overall, this beer might get lost in a giant tasting like this one, but I guarantee, if you have a bottle all to yourself, you are truly not going to want to share it.","Vdubb86","Mar 26, 2011"

The nose comprises toffee, graham crackers, light walnut, butterscotch, and a vague sense of alcohol. The taste brings in more of the tasty same, though the butterscotch and alcohol come through a bit more pronounced than before. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice, very tasty b-wine. My only real criticism was that the barrels really didn't impart as much bourbon character as I'd hoped. Despite this, though, this comes through as one damn fine barleywine, straight up.","TMoney2591","Mar 26, 2011"

A bit green on the finish with some earthy hops and booze, as well as a hint of sherry and cardboard-like oxidation. Still, I'm guessing that this beer has held up fairly well, and the alcohol is nicely hidden for the ABV.

Smell is very strong, but good. It is quite sweet in the taste with a hint of vanilla. Enjoy this beer pretty warm as, straight out of the cellar, it finishes with the reminder of the flavor of ham, which is unappealing. The people I enjoyed this beer with called me crazy, but acknowledged that the smoky, brown sugar sweet finish my allude to some honey ham. Once the beer warmed more, I was completely able to get over this issue and really enjoyed the beer. It is very thick and heavy in the mouth with low carbonation, but disguises the ABV really shockingly well. The drinkability is not limited by alcohol flavor, but instead intensity and its thick body. Ultimately, I held this beer to the highest of standards because I thought when I acquired it that this might become my favorite barleywine ever. To that, it did not live up to. Is this a really good beer though? Heck yes.","seeswo","Jan 07, 2011"

That being said, there's a lot to like here, and I did enjoy it. The aroma was pretty fantastic, and the flavor profile pretty robust and complex. On the whole, it's a mixed bag, and I'm not sure it's worth the $10.99 that was on the cap ... though maybe it'd be different fresh.

Unsurprisingly, the head isn't long for this world and leaves little trace behind. Aroma and flavor are both exceptionally sweet, overly complex and subtly balanced. The nose leads off with a strong boozy whisky and vanilla aroma with softer notes of figs, raisins, plums, brown sugar, caramel and sweet malts. Body is thick and lightly carbonated with a sweet, dry bourbon-y finish. A strong base of caramel, toffee and crisp malts supports the strong oak and woody flavors of the spirits and dark fruits. Incredibly smooth and balanced with surprisingly little alcohol heat throughout, despite the strong booze and spirit presence; this is an exceptional barrel aged beer.","yourefragile","Dec 06, 2010"

Wonderfully oxidized, sherry like with a hint of savoriness. The palate is massively malty and rich. Flavors of butterscotch and bourbon are balanced by tannic oak. Oxidation lends notes of sherry and faint soy sauce. Full, almost syrupy body, yet this is surprisingly easy to drink and very balanced. This was very good from the bottle, but it's outstanding on tap. There's virtually no trace of alcohol, and the balance between beer and barrel is impeccable.","largadeer","Sep 16, 2010"

The second was both 2005 and 2009 versions at the brewpub, and I was let down - I recall there being a weird smell akin to cat food in the 2005, and the 2009 needed some time to round into form. I'd rate this most recent experience to be in between those prior ones. This is a good beer, but there are a number of other barrel-aged barleywines that are better, IMO.

4.75,4.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"D: This is really, really good. The barrel-aging is VERY subtle, and it hits the zone for me when it's at the upper range of the "recommended" drinking temperature. Lovely. I want more. It's pricey as hell at $11 a 12oz, but this may be one of the few beers where I think it's actually worth it, like a Hair of the Dog special release. [EDIT: I have been informed that this was $8 / 12oz at the release. That is well worth it, IMO.]","Arbitrator","Jan 08, 2010"
4.87,7.5,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Ahhhh why I love English barley wines so much on top of that add bourbon barrel aging and you have one of the best beers I've tried in a long long while. A dessert style beer very sweet with mission fig, rum soaked rasins, caramel, date, currant, bourbon, vanilla, alcohol burn, a perfect tingly mouthfeel from a hint of carbonation that adds to the complexity. Slight oxidation and sherry quality. Christ this is good.","mcallister","Jan 07, 2010"
4.13,-8.8,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours hazy garnet/brown in color with ample tan carbonation. Smells of bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, and lots of toffee, among others. I like it, but the buttery toffee component is a little too much for my taste - reminds me a bit of Olde Bluehair's smell. Taste is outstanding - those same toffee, bourbon, raisin and brown sugar qualities are all quite strong, and blend together well. Not hoppy at all, this sits on the line where barleywines end and old ales begin. Mouthfeel is thick, sticky, coating, and well-supported by ample carbonation. At 14%, I was expecting to have difficulty drinking this, but those concerns proved unfounded.","waltonc","Jan 01, 2010"

4.42,-2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"375 ml bottle with gold foil courtesy of KingG, thanks again Joey for this treat, 2007 vintage, poured into my Rader snifter tonight, dark brownish red, 3/4 inch creamy light tan head, retention was around ten minutes which was suprising for a two year old barrel aged beer, some lacing at the top of the glass too, aroma consists of bourbon first, sweet malts including toffee and caramel, brown sugar, alcohol, prunes, biscuit, mild citrus, and oak, flavor starts off with a semi sweet vanilla flavor, sweetness along with some almost toasted malts in the middle that were much like the biscuit I could smell, some mild alcohol flavors in the finish but nothing like you would expect from a beer of this strength, also some oak and vanilla lingers in the aftertaste, more whiskey comes out as it warms, it tastes very Jack Daniel's like too, warms up with more malts coming to the surface but never really gets cloying or hot, sweet, warming, and malty mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, low to medium carbonation, taste lingers a long time, this beer is very smooth but almost syrupy, alcohol is hidden well for fourteen percent, it is a bit filling though, drank most of this bottle tonight and did not want anything else, I have wanted to try this beer for years and glad I finally got the chance, it certainly lived up to expectations and I am interested in seeing what the higher alcohol version batch two tastes like in the future, recommended","Floydster","Dec 31, 2008"

4.43,-2.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Re-rate on 10/29/07. Pours a clear copper to brown color with lasting thin tan head. The aroma is up in your face big and bold with the aroma of a oak paneled shed followed by sweet creamy caramel candy and some chocolate malts. It also has a sizable load of fruity esters with prunes, dates and a bucket of raisins. The alcohol is not all that well hidden for a 10% beer. But for this beers big ABV it isn't too bad. The flavor is just as bold as the aroma with a whack in the face by a freshly milled oak plank followed quickly by red wine grapes, red wine tannins mixed with rich caramel candy. The alcohol is there too. Nice. Another decade of age could see this good beer turn truly great.","BigMcLargeHuge","Apr 14, 2007"
4.42,-2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a cola brown to amber in color, clear, with a small cream head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aromas are strong of the barrel ageing. Salty, a deep leatheriness, woodiness, and a good booziness are most prominent. There are sweet pruny malts in the background, more subdued under the effects of the barrel. Agitation reveals more of the deep leather, oak, and bourbon notes, you can almost smell the inside of a barrel. Taste is a flash of rich maltiness up front followed by the booziness, leather and grapes/raisins, and finishing oaky and dry, a boozy bite warms the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation keeps it somewhat slick, dry on the tongue in the aftertaste and warming. This is one of those beers for me where from the first smell I am taken in, my pen is writing furiously rather than searching for aromas and flavors. I'd love to try the good, i am sure it is an outstanding barleywine based on this sample. I hope that alpine produces this again in the future, outstanding beer.","hoppymeal","Feb 24, 2007"
3.8,-16.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"From the bottle at Spuyten Duyvil in Brooklyn, New York. Light bronze color. Unfortunately, it has a very mild nose overall, but it does show some barrel contribution (coconut, toasted oak, vanilla), very mild, piney aroma hops and a caramel laden malty aspect. Extremely well hidden alcohol, shockingly hidden beyond belief, quite honestly, yet it isnt quite as rich as I had hoped. Nice blending of butter toffeeish malt, with the barrel contribution quite profound, with toasted oak and vanilla flavors. Creamy, big full body, yet lacking in texture in a way. Still pretty delicious overall, although I did expect a bit more.","Crosling","Dec 18, 2006"

4.67,3.1,4.5,5,5,4,4,"Great is a perfect name for this beer. Oak barrel aged, notes of vanilla and bourbon come through in this barleywine. It is deep, dark with some red hues. Clear, no head. It is still available at the brewery so I don't know why it is retired but it soon will be since they said they didn't have much left. Very yummy beer.","bigbelcher","Sep 04, 2006"
4.1,-9.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Dark brown, sparkly carbonation. Aroma is fruity, alchohol, bourbon, sweet, malty. Huge bourbon flavors took me by surprise, I was not expecting so much whiskey flavor. Followed by cereal malt flavor, and a strange vegetable kind of aftertaste, I couldn't place it. This beer is like drinking bourbon but without the alhoholic sting. A heavy powerful brew, syrupy and sweet. Very glad I shared the bottle with someone. Take your time and enjoy this one.","stoner420","Apr 22, 2006"

The taste was malty with flavors of caramel, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. Very nice, rich flavors. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium-full body and low carbonation. The finish and aftertaste were filled with flavors of wood, malt, and alcohol. This was an excellent and quite enjoyable brew!","UncleJimbo","Jan 05, 2006"
