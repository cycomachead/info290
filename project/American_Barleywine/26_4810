Soon after a peasantly sour mixed with a bitter effect and the higher abv blending in comfortably.  Mouthfeel has hop bitterness lingering in back of the mouth.  Sugars lay on the tongue.  Overall this is really a treat.  Not one component outdoes the other.  Well done.","joeseppy","Mar 27, 2015"

Cherry, plum, prune with a nice sweetness.  I greatly enjoyed this.  The hops obviously faded and this almost resembled a quad, but it was fantastic nonetheless.","MLDucky","Mar 10, 2015"

I guess we weren’t quite sure what to expect for a “blonde barleywine”, but for some reason a major hoppy component wasn’t it.  It was pleasant, translating well into flavoring.  Sadly, it remained way up front in the mouth, getting battered by waves of sharp booze and heavy grain.  This introductory taste actually made us think of a “Super Zombie Dust”.  It was so hopped!!  Again, however, you then hit this monstrous wall of bitters, puckers, and chemicals.  All that said, we’ve had DIPAs that are bigger malt bombs than this barleywine, but the booze keeps you in line with your thinking; at least this works when remembering style.  This beer wasn’t bad, but it just kind of took us for a loop following that description.  If you want a big, big beer that isn’t afraid to show you what it is, then this is the ticket for you, our friend.","TheBrewo","Feb 09, 2015"

Definitely an american barleywine. This is like a DIPA with the malt bill kicked up for added body and sweetness. It works very well.

Aroma is caramel, toffee, orange peel, some more fruits, figs. Flavor is big time malts, toffee, caramel, lots of fig, some orange peel, still some semblance of hops with a little dankness, and more big malty notes. Lots of flavor, and very much on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is chewy but with plenty of carbonation despite the age.

4.2,-0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass; Fall 2011 Ohio bottling with yellow wax. Pours slightly cloudy reddish orange color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, floral, grass, pine, brown sugar, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, tangerine, toast, floral, brown sugar, raisin, pear, light pine, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, toast, brown sugar, pear, raisin, floral, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine style. All around great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Sep 01, 2013"

3.73,-12,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"orange wax edition, shared with friends, thank goodness. this beast pours a burnt orange color, with lots of yeast sediment and maybe an inch of just off white head. the nose is really sweet, English toffee, dark caramel, brown sugar, and beet sugars as well. there is also a lot of hops, not quite hog heaven level, but this is definitely an American barleywine, with some pine notes and even some tropical fruits emanating from the hopping. the taste is crisp for how sweet it is, and I think the hops do save this beer from being just a sugar bomb. the alcohol is piercing, and the flavors all combine to be like a really good bread pudding. sort of odd in a beer, but I enjoyed the flavors coming together as they did. the feel is a little sluggish. not quite bubbly enough, and the sweetness starts to take hold after half a glass or so. this beer becomes pretty punishing when its warm, but so do most barleywines. I know its the wrong time of year for this, so maybe that had something to do with my dislike of the mouthfeel, but this is a complex and enjoyable beer nevertheless. still waiting to be blown away by three floyds though.","StonedTrippin","Jun 03, 2013"

What you have here is a very good beer and an interesting take on the style. A hop head who has a sweet tooth would definitely enjoy this one. The sheer body of this beer is enough to make any craft beer enthusiast content. If you have access to it and like DIPAs or Barleywines then pull the trigger. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'd age one.","JamesMN","Feb 16, 2013"

3.58,-15.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"The palate, however, falls rather flat. Heavy on the crystal malt, this is astringent without (thankfully!) too much sweetness. While the astringency does fade as the beer warms up and has time to breathe, it is initially rather unpleasant. This beer is pretty big and sweet. The hops have faded gracefully, leaving some mild pine bitterness and some citrus fruitiness. The mid-palate has plenty of fruit, with red delicious apples, a little grape, Alcohol does appear on the finish, mildly warming. Full in body, this is soft and lush on the palate. The finish has crystal malt and a mild bitterness. Decent stuff. The alcohol is rather well-hidden IMO. However, there just isn't enough malt complexity to keep this interesting on the palate, nor is it worthy of time in a cellar IMO.","DefenCorps","Jul 11, 2012"

3.23,-23.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"OVERALL: An enjoyable beer, but there's not much barleywine about it really. It is too hop forward and lacks a big enough malt base to put it in this style classification. Perhaps a couple years of age will do this one some good, but fresh, it's simply another hop bomb of a DIPA. This makes scoring it a tough task, as it was a really nice beer, but was also mislabled. Anyways, this is a beer I'd gladly drink in mass quantities, but not if I'm in the mood for a barleywine. Thanks for the cool beer Irishgurl4.

Takes a few minutes for the head to disappear which is about right. In the smell I get the normal hop characteristics of all FFF beers, which makes for an amazing smell, odd to get in a barley wine but this is FFF after all. After the hops I get a deep and profound sweetness throughout. The smell is up there as one of the most pleasant smelling beers out there. Taste wise this beer is very complex. At first you get a very nice smoothness to it, then you get a hit from the hops like a pale ale, and then it finishes with the sweet alcohol ending like most barley wines have. The sweetness and smoothness fade away to leave the hops that everyone knows and loves about FFF beers to linger on the palate for a while. The mouthfeel is very nice and leaves a residue on the inside of the mouth after consuming. Overall this is probably my favorite barley wine I have had and was intending to age this but was told to drink it sooner rather than later as it loses some of the hop characteristic. I would recommend this beer and next time I will pick up 2 and age one.","TheTot","Mar 05, 2012"

But hey, hops are great and so is this beer. I wouldn't say it's their best offering nor would I say it's the best the barleywine style has to offer. I'm looking forward for this one aged a year or so. Yes I couldn't resist not stashing one back in a cool, dark place. Bottles with wax just beg for some cellaring.","BradtheGreat7","Feb 24, 2012"

4.27,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"2011 bottle. Pours a bright and mostly clear orange tinted brown, minimal cap of off white froth gone quickly. Even after a year, the scent is dominated by hops, muted pine and mildly bright citrus lead, backbone brings notes of buttery toffee, light caramel and whiskey. When poured at about 40-45 degrees, the flavor still had a decent hop profile, while the sweetness was light and the malts did not provide much character. As it approached room temperature, flavor blossomed with nice toffee and whiskey notes found in scent, hops still lead the overall profile though. While carbonation was at a nice level, the beer felt a little too light for the style, lacking any sticky or coating texture or even smoothness. Great scent and taste from this hop centric barleywine, body lacking compared to many other true barleywines.","rfgetz","Feb 19, 2012"

3.95,-6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"2008 vintage shared by Dave Guay - I've been wanting to try this one for a while. Pours the color and clarity of cider - no volume to the head; just a soapy skim and a thin band around the shoulders. Aromas of malt, prunes, bready, sugared fruit and ethanol comprise the nose. Taste follows nose with the addition of a little medicinal bitterness towards the finish. All and all - not as sweet as suggested by the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an easy carbonation and a trace of acidity at the finish. Overall, this beer is really quite solid, but I do think it has a great deal more aging potential. I'd love to see this with another three years on it.","Jwale73","Nov 08, 2011"

There is a nice mixture of sweet malt, cherries, candied fruit, and it has a resinous hop aroma that I definitely dig. There is a light alcohol aroma present on the back end. The flavors are very sweet fruits initially. It's almost syrupy. It reminds me of toffee a toffee and citrus blend which is definitely interesting but still flavorful and tasty. That resinous factor comes into play again and the hops come alive. It is a little sweet but that should be expected of a barleywine that is roughly three years and three months old.

With an abv of 10.5%, Behemoth is very smooth and drinkable. The mouthfeel is exceptional, exactly what a barleywine should be; rich and expansive. Behemoth's finish is extraordinarily barleywie.

The color is darker than a standard Blonde but carries with it a much lighter complexion than a standard Barley Wine. The nose is sweet and full of aroma. The taste and mouth feel are thick and full of robust sweetness and hops. The finish is strong but there is not much length but it leaves you with wanting more.

Extremely well-rounded and smooth - dried fruit, toasted malt, and wood. Finishes dry with earthy/piney hops that linger. Some alcohol presence, but not in the taste.

But it is the tropical fruit note that makes this really special! Taste includes loads of fresh tropical fruit like mango, melon, and other fruits, piney bitter hops balance perfectly, and lead to sweet caramel towards the finish, with the alcohol not all that detectable. Chewy, resiny finish with loads of tropical fruit and lingering bitterness. Creamy full body with soft carbonation throughout.

The beer has lots of citrusy hops on the palate that actually mostly cover up the malty background. Though a caramel like flavor does find it's way though to make it's presence known.

The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit, leek, light-ish pine, and sweet, sweet toffee. The taste does not strive to deviate from this pre-determined path, though the grapefruit is slightly intensified, and some mandarin orange syrup seeps in as well.

Darn smooth really but would benefit from several more years of aging.2005 vintage. It pours a hue darker than the '06 with an even bolder tan head. The aroma is much more barleywine like with a suitable level of dark fruity esters to break up the once hop dominated nose. I also get a just noticeable caramel note.

Appearance is a dark orange, with three fingers of white heading, taking a long time to die down. Smell is of floral hops, but of garlic, mango and other citrus fruits. Gentle flowery hops dominate in the taste, with the malt taking a backseat. Alcohol burn is there in a very mild way. Feel is on the medium side. Drinkability is superb, but after more than one of these, you would definitely be feeling it. As others have commented, this beer really tastes more like an Imperial IPA than a Barleywine. At the same time, sometimes the line between those two styles gets blurred, which isn't a bad thing. So I guess this is just a really hopped up Barleywine.

The balance of malt must have knocked that down a bit. It was actually dangerously smooth, I'm sure if I didn't know what I was drinking I could have ordered three or four and ended up on the floor.

It's still high, however, which does knock down the drinkability score a few points. The aroma is also somewhat weak, not in pungency as much as in complexity. This beer really shined through later on, however, and I wish many of the complexities of the mouth had been more evident in the nose. The mouthfeel was also perfectly balanced, smooth, creamy, sublime.

If I were fortunate enough to live in an area where it were feasible, I'd buy a couple of these to cellar for a year or two - I doubt the hops would suffer to the point where this became unenjoyable, and the estery alcohol might be able to use a little time to cool down. Nonetheless, recommended, fresh or otherwise - a solid brew.","CrellMoset","Nov 30, 2008"

Tastes pretty mellow as far as the heat from the abv goes. More stiff malt with a big, dry minerally backbone, but overlayed by sweet brown sugar and pine and grapefruit flavors from the hops. Relatively mellow in intensity as well and quite smooth. The mouthfeel is mellow and quite creamy with nary a hint of sharp alcohol.

An outer ring remains which leaves a good amount of stick on the sides of the glass. Smell begins with a powerful punch of piney hops, slick oily hops, and rich malt. Sweet candy sugars and some spice tickle the nose as well. Booze does make an appearance, but I was expecting that for the style and abv. Overall the aroma is very powerful and can be detected from halfway across the room, I love it. Taste begins with sweet malts followed by slick piney hops. Midway the caramel malt becomes more present with a touch of citrus. Aftertaste is dry and sweet, almost like hard candy I used to get from my grandma back in the day. Overall the taste isn't as complex as I had expected after taking a whiff, but it's still good none the less. Medium to full body with a smooth and creamy feel and a carbonation that stings the mouth leaving it slightly dry. I can't belive this beer is 12%, I hardly taste any of that on the tongue which is pretty scary. Barleywines aren't my favorite style, but this is defintely one of my favorites of the group.

Lots of oily resins segue into bitter waves of pine resin and grapefruit bitterness. Red apple and cherry notes float into the middle.

This must be one of the sweetest tasting barley wines I have ever had, sweet malt, carmel and spices, with of sweet fruit flavors. Then at the end a hard smack of bitterness levels the playing field. A thick and sticky feel, with it almost wanting stick to the palate, then as it reaches the back of the throat the warming sensation of alchol hits the throat.

Some alcohol shows up in the taste as the beer warms a bit, but it's not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy, it's oily and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is good too, the beer goes down smooth and it's easier to drink than you'd think it would be, considering the ABV.

Someone needs to explain supply and demand to 3F. Still, I will buy a few more as this is an astounding example of a barleywine. English or American?? Personally I think it is bordering on an English style as the hops are not that prominent. It is so complex with grapefruit, brown sugar, nuts, caramel, super sweet and creamy.

Warming after-effects. Light carbonation, and extremely flavorful right out of the fridge - and still obviously delicious as it warms and becomes more toxic.

Some pineyness and a citrusy vitamin c tablet flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich, there is also some chalkiness with the vitamin c flavor, a drying hop finish with some warmth from the alcohol. Interesting beer, the alcohol conent is amazingly balanced for its strength, but there are some different flavors and textures (vitamin c) that attack my palate.

Nothing but hop aromatics in the aroma and if this were a Double IPA that would be fine, but in a barley wine I want malt aromatics. Still though, the hops are vibrant enough in the nose to definately be enjoyable. The body is undeniably huge and provides a nice mouth experience. The flavor is fairly well balanced between hop and malt flavors, but overall I suppose this is more of a hop accented barley wine. Loads of juicy, medicinal hop flavors throughout the palate, with hints of grapefruit. The malts hints of toffee all the way through, with hints of caramel and roasted nuts. Quite the tasty treat, but it needs your complete attention and a pretty large sample, because it changes very much throughout the tasting. Also, I am not one for aging barley wines, but this really needs some time. Maybe it will peak at around six to eight months.

Expressive aroma firstly disarming you through a blast of floral, piney, sprucey aromatic amarillos. The underlying malt is not to be neglected, highly candyish, like concentrated Jolly Rancher juice. Tons of residual sugar components, yet well developed fruitiness, rich with melon and perfumed berry notes. Quite boozy in mouth, if not necessarily harshly so thanks to the cognac-like nature of the alcohol, reminding of a concentrated wine. Thus very sweet and fittingly very hoppy, foresty, fruity, woody and throath-coating. Very malty spirit is betrayed by a rather syrupy palate, certainly fruity and alcoholic, but also rather oily and slick even, the carbonation being restrained to say the least.

There was a big malt backbone with a bit of alcohol that attempted to balance out the intense hop bitterness and huge hop flavour. Caramel and toffee malt provided lots of sweetness, and pine, grapefruit, and orange hop flavours produced a pleasant counterpoint. Lingering bitterness and resiny grapefruit in the finish. Plenty of alcohol warmth, which became a little hot in the finish after a while. Moderately low carbonation, fine bubbles, slightly syrupy. Pretty good overall, there's a lot of potential for this one as it matures. Thanks Viggo!","DrJay","Oct 25, 2005"
4.11,-3.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"this beer exists somewhere between a barrel aged bw and a double ipa. dark lord epitomizes excess. this is more like dreadnaught, finding happiness in balance. can't wait to see where an aged bottle or two goes, however this is ready to drink NOW.","goodbyeohio","Oct 21, 2005"

4.5,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As soon as you pop the top off this the hops come right at you. It poured out a dark red with a tall tan head that left streaks and rings of lace as it collapsed. Big citric hop notes with plenty of pine to go along with it. There is a big sweetness there as well as some ripe fruit notes and caramel malt competes with the giant hoppiness. No real alcohol comes out in the nose surprisingly. Taste is huge as well plenty of grapefruit and pine needle hops smacking you around with a nice bitterness. Dark ripe fruit notes balance it out a bit with some sweetness as does light caramel and light doughiness. Lots of stuff going on in the flavor and it all seems to come on strong. I think in a few months it might all meld together better which would really boost this to greatness. Ends with some bitter and sweet fruits. This definitely warms you up real quick with the first sip. Thick and almost syrupy with a bit of sticky sweetness going on. No lack of body here. Pretty damn drinkable with all things considered. Another great beer form 3 Floyds.","meathookjones","Oct 12, 2005"
4.28,0.9,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - It is a great beer, but is over the top in ABV and taste, this was split in two, and took about an hour and a half to finish, but enjoyed it all.","Bumpon10s","Oct 12, 2005"
4.87,14.9,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Opened bottle hop aroma stretched across the room. Poured out nice reddish brown to copper color. Head long lasting some lacing. Head color off white. Aroma of hops, hops and more hops. It helps to accentuate the caramel, cherry, malt, and grapefruit. Tastes of hops, hops, and more hops. With caramel, malt and some grapefruit to start. Hops flavor lingering throughout. Warming up brings in some cherry, maple, piney character as well. Nicely carbonated, full bodied with slight aclcohol warming becoming present after half pint or so. Just a spectacular American Barley Wine. Well balanced even with the large hops aroma, and hop flavoring. You never really lose the other aromas and flavoring. Smooth till the finish seemingly aged a while before bottling. Well done 3F. All I can really say to express true feeling toward this beer is WoooHOOOO","amatuerbeerguy","Oct 12, 2005"

4.52,6.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Bomber bottle with wax on the top. Pours an amber/brown color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma reveals a lot of US hops as well as slight fruit and a strong malt character. The flavor is much the same. Big caramel malt backing with some cherry flavors and lots of hops. Fairly thick mouthfeel and the drinkability is very good. This is a very nice barleywine.","clvand0","Oct 09, 2005"
4.48,5.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a brilliant and clear deep amber to mahogany with a light tan head that falls to a ring around the top. The light passing through it gives a really nice amber to red glow to the foot of my glass. The nose is not nearly as big as I expected it to be. There is a deep caramel sweetness with notes of artificial cherry from the aroma hop and a moderate piney hop bitterness. Very nice and rather complex. I like that its not incredibly strong. Flavor big maltyness...caramel is most prominent with fruity notes and light pineyness from the hop. No real bitterness hangs on. Aftertase is a little like spun sugar. Sweet, but not cloying. Tasty. The feel is thick, slightly syrupy with a light carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding. No hint at all of the ABV on this beer. The flavors meld well together and everything just works so well. Well worth trying. I like it.","kmpitz2","Oct 08, 2005"
4.47,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a very dark copper with a tannish head on top that chilled out for a while there. Carbonation was apparent, in the opaque body. Smelled of pine, grapefruit, cherry, malty maltiness. Taste was of a warm alcohol bite, some sweet brown sugar, pine needles, juniper, grapefruit, plum, some whiskey notes and a very sweet finish with the hops bouncing around the tongue. This stuff was too drinkable for how strong it was. As I already drink beer pretty fast, I drank this one WAY too fast. Dangerous but delicious.","HoboAGoGo","Oct 03, 2005"
4.32,1.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D-Wow this beer has a good balance of big juicy hops and a powerful alcohol warmth. It would be nice to have a little more complexity in the malt flavor. I think this beer is young, bottled ~2 weeks ago, so as it ages it should get better and better.","rhoadsrage","Oct 02, 2005"
4.62,9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Good Beer. If you have tried Dreadnaught, you will probably expect nothing less from Three Floyds in the Barleywine category. A must try.","beerinator","Oct 02, 2005"
4.34,2.4,4,5,4.5,4,3.5," The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It is certainly coating. The drinkability is better than average, but the acidity of this prevents me from having another one, for now. I have plenty for later.","Sephiroth","Beers"
4.69,10.6,4,5,5,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is dense with a nice creamy aspect and good stable carbonation. Chewy without going over the top. A nice sipper as each one packs an array of flavors. I wouldn't mind having a few of these on a cold day..but you have to watch out for that ABV. Paired nicely with some 3 year old cheddar. Well worth seeking out...I have a feeling that aging this a year or two will produce some good results. Still a bit overpriced in the grand scheme of things...but I guess one should not put a price on happiness...and right now I'm pretty damn happy.","orbitalr0x","0"
4.92,16,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Rounded out by a thick mouthfeel, but not cloying or pasty, I tasted this beer whenever I burped or coughed for the next 24 hours, literally. Very extreme, but very drinkable in that over-the-top way. Found it on-tap at the Blind Tiger, a couple days after their Barleywine festival, and am very happy to have experienced it.","nomad","Dec 28, 2003"
4.5,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"While there is perhaps the slightest detection of alcohol looming underneath all the huge flavors here, it's super drinkable nonetheless. A very well-done barleywine, as one would expect from this brewery. Great stuff.","Jon","Sep 27, 2003"
4.2,-0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Browns tree-bark brown with large off-white head. Aroma is beautiful malt and sweet bitterness. Dark fruit aromas, prunes, raisins along with citrus fruits. Flavor is wonderful malt ! Even the bitterness seems to be infused with earthy malty flavors. Almost a light smoke or peat also was detected. Really excellent beer that I think would do amazing sitting some 22 oz. bottles for a year or two in the cellar.","CRJMellor","Sep 19, 2003"
4.58,8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Deep amber color. Small head. Aroma is floral hops and malts. A very big bold malty and hoppy barleywine. VERY smooth taste. The big rich malts are balanced by big floral citrusy hops. A very well balanced barleywine. The alcohol is not at all evident despite the 11.5%. VERY nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is surprisingly dry. Aftertaste is malty, with a lingering slight bitterness.","beerguy101","Jun 26, 2003"
4.5,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Translucent amber with a thin but persistent head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Aroma is full of floral and pine hops, with some malt sneaking through. I can tell immediately that this is an Americanized Barleywine... but I'm not complaining. Flavor begins with a rich carmel malt sweetness that gives way to a piney bitterness... nicely balanced... not too much bitterness, just enough. Quite a bit of flavor and aroma hops went into this, and the hoppiness is quite pleasant. Moutfeel is sticky and oily with a full body and medium to low carbonation. Absolutely delicious!","zerk","May 19, 2003"
1.88,-55.7,5,2,1.5,2,1.5,"Hotstuff and I went on a tour of their brewery. For $5 you get a 12oz glass of 3 of their beers. I thought this was the worst of their beers. The aroma was obnoxious to me. The head was mixed with large and small bubbles. It had a heavy taste with an after bite and an initial taste that I could only describe as off. The color was very nice deep caramel brown and you could not see through it. Hotstuff did not rate it but preferred to get another Robert The Bruce instead!","TheDM","Apr 24, 2003"

4.67,10.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5," Hazy, orange/red color, thick, creamy tan head receeds to wispy froth covering the beer. Blast of fruity aromas - cantaloupe and raisins mixed w/ wildflowers. Full bodied, sugary malt up front, flavors of honey on toast - hops then bite the tongue and back of the throat while more grassy hops take charge of finishing things. Hop infused , sugary sweetness coats your mouth. This is like eating hop candy! Alcohol is there but does not over power this tasty barleywine. Very drinkable w/ a unique nuttiness and exceptional balance.","Shiredave","Beers"
4.3,1.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Deep amber with slight carbonation. Very fruity nose. The flavor starts out by attacking every tastebud in your mouth - primarily sweet malt, with a background bitterness and alcohol that sings its praises loudly. Caramelly mid-sip, with a floral citrusy hoppiness hiding at the end. The finish changes 3 times in 2 seconds, from hop to sweet to toffee.  The main flavor is a sweet maltiness that is incredibly similar to my buddy's 1996 barleywine, so much so that I told him to haul his keester over to the bar because they kegged it for him. Huge. Wonderful.","sponberg","0"
