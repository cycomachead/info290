4.5,16.3,,,,,,"2014 edition from a bomber.  Pours a deep chocolate brown that light barely penetrates (to think this was a clear red brew just a couple of years ago). Low carbonation and thick, creamy mouthfeel, with the cocoa nibs first introduced last year prominent.  Almost no hop flavor, all roasted dark malts. Unstated ABV and absolutely no alcohol taste or aroma, but it comes up on one towards the end of the bottle.  First sip was a little sweet for someone like me who doesn't appreciate that, but my palate settled into to it quickly. Obviously not an all day drinker but well positioned as a dessert beer. I suspect this may develop in interesting ways over the next few weeks as the yeast settles out more, and possibly fall off fairly quickly afterwards.  Snazzy new label.","slangtruth","Nov 22, 2014"

The nose comprises pine resin, light dark greens, rich toffee, and a touch of fruitcake way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the toffee and pine duking it out for my entertainment, creating a decently nice balance; and some mild stone fruits dance in the back, seemingly egging on the combatants. Normally, when I use those terms, it means there's a flavor clash on my tongue, but this time it's just to illustrate the balanced see-saw thing going on instead. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty nice brew, one that brings the hop pain without overwhelming with it.

This is not a barleywine. This isn't even an American Barleywine. Its a lightly hopped, slightly dank, average run of the mill IPA.

4.12,6.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Popping the cap my nose is hit was a nice dose of citrusy hops. Surprising. Poured into a goblet a couple-finger head leaves a smattering of rorschach blots around the glass (the second pour really cakes it on, tight elegant lace rings) The nose is exotic fruit jam, sweet by not cloying. I think this version is more like an imperial english-style ipa than a barleywine so get this while its fresh. The finish is dryly hoppy without any significant bitterness. Really invites the next sip. The alcohol is well hidden. If this is still in the 9.5 - 10% range it doesn't taste like it. Sweetness is quickly cut through with a grainy, rustic bread quality that balances the brew nicely. The blurb on the bottle describes its bitterness as prominent without being aggressive which is about right. BBC has really been ringing my bell lately. This is definitely up there with my favorites. Good stuff.","Masscraft","Nov 17, 2012"

Opening quite sweet with a rather prominent hop character, I get a ton of really good flavors up front, with caramel, toffee and mint all making for a tasty beverage before a finish that is sorely lacking in character. The blend up front featuring the caramel and pine is pleasant, but the beer quickly devolves to a mildly bitter finish with no real malt flavors that one expects from a barleywine. And while there is a certain heft to the palate, this still comes across as slightly watery, even when at 60+F. Is there rye in this beer? The spiciness I taste is definitely not from the alcohol, I can swear there's some in here,and some reviews refer to it as well. Also, with time, I'm noticing a butterscotch character which isn't wholly pleasant either, especially in conjunction with the hop profile. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, the palate is decent but for the finish.

Aroma is sugary sweet, liight caramel, and surprisingly low hop aroma for an American Barleywine. Great flavor on this one. Nice candy-sweet flavors, a touch of spicy breadiness, some caramel, and very well-balanced hopping. There's almost a citrusy, orange/lemon-lime type thing going and is reminiscent of sweet tart candies. This is an American Barleywine that I can get into because it's not ridiculously, over-the-top hopped, which I think really can get in the way of what a barleywine is supposed to be with other brews in the same category. Great, slick mouthfeel, coats the tongue, and the high ABV can barely be felt. I'm really digging the balance on this beer and I have to say it's probably the best barleywine I've had in a very long time. Excellent stuff, and I'm sure it's recieved lower ratings because some people think that if doesn't offend your palate with hops then it must not be good.

The head is nice and creamy looking and leaves medium lacing on my glass. Pillows cover the top after the head is gone. Smell needs more strength right off the bat. Notes of fruits, malts and a tiny bit of hops. The fruits smell pretty sweet but the malts smell nice. Hard for me to pick up much here. The taste is pretty much like a standard ale. Huge malt backbone, almost rye tasting. The hops add some fruity and bitter flavor and even some spice. The strength of the hops is not too high, which I like in a Barleywine. The fruity flavors are tasteful and add a nice aspect to this one. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creamy texture. Moderate carbonation works well here and a huge coat of fruity malts is on the tongue. No warming, very smooth. Alcohol comes into the taste later on in the beer and starts to take away from it. The price is OK but more expensive than other BBC offerings which I like more. Would like a better aroma and less alcohol take over.","cbutova","Jan 04, 2010"

Poured a translucent amber/copper with a one inch, tight, bone white head that settles into a broken skim with thick trails of lacing in its wake. Nose reveals dark fruit (your typical plum & prunes), as well as a sugary, berry jam quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, much more balanced and blended with just a kiss of hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sparklingly effervescent with a dry finish. In the last month, I've had this on-draft, from the cask (incredible) and from the bottle. A really excellent seasonal with a deceivingly well-hidden abv (espcially on-cask).

Neverless, this is a damn good beer. Mouthfeel is coating, yet refreshing. Drinkability is dangerously high, I could sip on this all night.

Pretty sneaky, definitely makes someone drink a lot of it while hiding a probably high alcohol content. A great, thick body with a low-medium carbonation allows this to be wonderfully sipped throughout the whole night.

This beer seems to be very pleasing to the eye and pallet. It has a dark hazy reddish auburn hue with a big off-white head. The head dissipates slowly and creates a solid lace down the whole glass. This brew smells of caramel and sweet fruity malt. Nice fruit tones of plum and perhaps some apricot. The smell is very floral and fruity with some hints of spice in the nose. Taste is sweet up front then followed by some caramel malt and a hint of fruitiness. This is an extremely smooth and enjoyable beer. Mild tone of yeast mixed with the plum and other fruit tones. Solid brew that is really easy to drink. Nice complexity to the flavor as the beer warmed. Quite a unique offering with many new flavors that jump around in my mouth. I am curious to see how this one will taste with a few months of aging in the fridge. I have been enjoying it now and so have a few of my friends. This one certainly gets the cheeks rosy.

4.02,3.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Hazy, coppery-gold in hue with tawny-bronze influences. Lazy appearance. The head didnt form properly, at the most the off-white head barely covered the liquid and then it quickly dissipated to a thin collar. In my glass this barleywine has a sad, sluggish appearance. The lack of subsequent lacing contributes to the image. There is nothing truly odd or flawed about it, just too normal looking. Am I being picky? Maybe, but I try to be consistent. The nose is sweet. Strong notes of banana dipped in caramel sauce, lightly drizzled with chocolate pine needles, which is the strongest of the secondary aromas, this balances the sweetness rather well. Weak hints of butter. The malt fails to say much. The nose lacks complexity. It needs more malt. It needs a hop bite; the hops do offer some spruce notes. I like that. The nose isnt great, its kind of soft and there are more things about it that needs improving than things that are excellent. With that said the bouquet is still good. Inviting. The palate is more put-together than the nose. Bananas flambé. Caramel dipped dark fruits, chocolate covered cherries. Pine needles are juxtaposed. This is a sweet barleywine. It might be hop poor but its malt rich. Hops offer spruce notes and some aforementioned pine. Bitterness is moderate but it fails to supersede the malt. I assume this is intentional. Sweet from start to finish, it could use some toasty qualities. Again, Im nitpicking but when it comes to barleywines they better shine in every aspect or Ill say what I wish was happening. Now, dont let these comments fool you, this is a damn tasty beverage. Id gladly drink this beer again, especially with cheese or a chocolate muffin. Its a solid offering. Basically full in body, heavy from the low carbonation and tons of residual sweetness. Healthy mouthfeel. Sometimes big and lumbering works, in this case it does. It is also plenty drinkable, like I said, Id surely be happy to quaff this one again but I wouldnt drink more than one or two a winter.
