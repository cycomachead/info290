3.99,6.1,2.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Overall impression:  A big and boozy American Barleywine.  I could have used some filtering or lagering to get rid of the floaties.  Also, some age could have relieved some of the ETOH "hotness".  I decent shot but for the price, I'll stick to the American standards (i.e. Bigfoot).","mattcrill","Feb 28, 2015"
4.13,9.8,4,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Overall- Even with a year age the hops are still very noticeable. Tale of two beers, up front there is a huge sweetness, fruitiness, but midway through the beer transitions into a hop bitterness and dry, oaky, port like finish. Rather enjoyable to see the beer transform like that with every sip, a unique type of balance in that there are two extemes going on. Enjoyable sipper.","OrangeMen","Feb 28, 2015"

3.91,4,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"12oz bottle dated 03/12/14. Pours a murky medium brown with virtually no head. Almost no lacing. The aroma is boozey with some caramel, dark fruits, bread and a hint of citrus. The taste is caramel and wheat bread with some raisins, plums, and orange peel. Boozey with a noticeable alcohol presence, of course. Still I'm surprised the ABV isn't higher. Woody and boozey finish. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, solid choice I'd grab again.","PicoPapa","Feb 21, 2015"

Flavor is - whoa, the alcohol bite means it is not for the faint of heart! Aside from that is has rather subdued notes of caramel, cloves and woody hops plus a hint of honey. Syrupy texture is smooth and does not seem to have a lot of fizz. If you like barleywines, this may be up your alley.","Cyberkedi","Dec 31, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, plum, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish. Very nice complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice American barleywine style. All around good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 08, 2014"
3.8,1.1,,,,,,"Went to my fridge wanting something big and boozy and this ticks the boxes so it pours a full dark copper red hue with a one finger head and a rim of lacing, the smell is definately a hoppy barleywine with aromas of piney resinous hops, sweet barley and booze, the mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are piney hops mixed with sweet toffee, caramelized pears and finished with a fruity boozy bitterness and overall a nice hoppy barleywine thats worth a shot cheers.","ADZA","Sep 08, 2014"

Taste is much the same with toasted malt, brown sugar, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

3.9,3.7,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"i found this to be a very interesting take on a barleywine, more of an american strong dark ale, insofar as the two are distinct from one another, but nevertheless, i liked this better than the gentleman i shared it with. a curious nose, hoppy and spicy, like a winter warmer or holiday beer, with some clove and molasses, but i think most or all of that is a product of a very large and diverse grain bill. the flavor comes on in waves. sweet and grainy first, the only part of this that resembles classic barleywine, but it is short loved, moving into a spice palate that includes cloves, allspice, and even something a little more funky, cardamom or cinnamon maybe, tough to tell because the hops start in before the spice fully evolves. bitter as anything on the finish, which is one sense is nice because it cuts the grain sweetness, but on the other had is frustrating because it exacerbates and exposes the prominent alcohol strength of this ale. fizzy carbonation makes it feel light on the palate, especially for the style and for this examples particular strength. i like its tricking drinkability, and would recommend this ale for the lover of the unconventional. nothing like the barleywine we expected, but an enjoyable beverage nevertheless.","StonedTrippin","Mar 04, 2014"

Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky garnet/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The brew smells like toffee, brown sugar, molasses, and dark fruit. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some caramel, earthiness, pine and dark bread. Nice mix of sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit syrupy and sticky with moderate carbonation. I thought this brew was good, it's worth a try. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Nov 17, 2013"

This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, it was cloying, the alcohol could have been hidden better and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, splitting this bottle with someone is enough for me, I wouldn't want to drink a whole bottle, it's way too sweet and cloying for me to have more than half a bottle. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma they were both nice with the head and lacing looking pretty good for a 10% Barleywine. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they weren't that good and they were the downfall of this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I wasn't that into it and it was way overpriced, I bought two of these so the other one is going to set in the cellar for a while and hopefully it improves a little, I wouldn't recommend it, it's not a great example of a Barleywine. All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, it doesn't have all the quality's that I look for in the style and the sweetness was just too out of hand and combined with the other flaws it made this beer pretty rough around the edges. This wasn't a good first impression for Evil Twin, I still have interest in them, but I'll for sure think twice before a I drop over $10 on a bottle, better luck next time, this one just wasn't for me.  2014 Edit So I aged a bottle from this same batch and it aged very nicely, the hops died down and it let more of those great malt flavors come through.  I liked this one more aged and I'm going to bump up the score from my original 3.11","StoutHunter","May 28, 2013"

Overall this beer wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. There are better Barley Wines out there.","Knapp85","Jul 29, 2012"
3.8,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a murky amber color with a small white head. Nose is lightly fruity, but quite heavy on the toffee and toasted malt. A bit of caramel and brown sugar along with some pine hop notes and a bit of perfume. The flavor has an almost woody note to it. Heavy on the pine hops with a moderate bitterness. Lots of toffee, a bit of toast, and some brown sugar. A bit of booze and perfume, too.","womencantsail","Jul 26, 2012"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark reddish brown amber with a nice one finger tan head that had good retention and tons of lacing. Looks good. Aroma of caramel malt and light citrus and pine hops. Flavor has sweet malt and dark fruit to start, slowly changing to a malty, nicely hopped finish and a lingering, slightly boozy pine and citrus hop aftertaste. Moderately complex and a very nice flavor progression. Medium to heavy bodied with moderate creaminess. The high ABV and hops make a bit of an astringent finish, but overall I enjoyed this well made American style barleywine. If I can find a reasonably priced second bottle, I would age one for a few years to calm the booziness.","LiquidAmber","Jul 15, 2012"

3.8,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a reddish borwn with decent head on top of a slightly boozy, sweet and sugary malt (along wiith touch of figs) and some breadiness; hopping minimal. This is a hearty, filling beer with some slight stickiness. Malt heavy, there is some caramel and sugary sweetness, tad syrupy, and (almost) evenly balanced with a touch of citrusy hops and alcohol. Unfortunately, the alcohol bleeds through, not only for a slightly too strong backbite but overall just kind of muddles the beer. Enjoyable sipper but not a great beer.","clayrock81","Apr 23, 2012"
3.85,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall this is a unique barleywine. Fan of the fact that the residual sweetness does not play the main part in this beer. Big big beer, slight astringency prevents it from being amazing.","natemort13","Apr 22, 2012"
3.8,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a murky yellowish brown with a two finger khaki colored head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, caramel, caramel hop, wood, and subtle vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, wood, alcohol, dark chocolate, and caramel hop. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this a fairly good brew. I really hate to say it, but this one was a little too boozy on the flavor for my liking. There were lots of things going in this one, but the booze just stole the show. Really unfortunate that was the case. Still not bad, but I doubt I could drink a full 750 mL bottle myself.","thagr81us","Apr 21, 2012"
