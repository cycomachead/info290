The nose comprises rye-ish biscuit, light toffee, mild tobacco-like greens, a twinge of candied orange peel, and a hint of celery. The taste continues the trend, with a spicy biscuit backbone riding high in the saddle, surrounded by mixed greens that don't pack much of a bitter wallop, but still serve as a minor balance to the malt. There's a slight twang of booze, but nothing that distracts from the main attractions. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a nice, surprisingly easygoing barleywine, one that showcases a balance and a restraint you don't normally find stateside. Good times.","TMoney2591","Aug 05, 2013"

A very faint whiff of smoke-probably more perceived then actually there. Toffee and buttery flavor. Mildly astringent hop bite. A hair out of balance with the hops. Mildly boozey though not overly so and not in a detrimental way. Sticky and gummy mouthfeel. The upfront sweetness quickly becomes dry. Enjoyable all in. Have wanted to try this for ages.

Tastes of honey and cherries with a biting but not unpleasant aftertaste of pure alcohol. Great mouth feel, almost a nectar. Smells mostly of cherries. This is one of the easiest to drink barleywines I've ever come across. About as close to a session beer as this style could ever be, not that that's saying much. Excellent, would buy again, cook with and even save a spot in the cellar for.","Snorlax","Sep 04, 2011"

Color is a clear cherry orange amber and some bubble trails. Aroma is a pronounced blend of malt, caramel, toffee, hops, fruit, yeast. Flavor is similar to nose and has a very good balance between sweet, bitter, and tang. Body is also very good, full and round with a few high points while carbonation is perhaps just a tad light. Finish is like flavor, has good length, and has some alcohol. A slow sipping brew over the course of a bomber or two.","drpimento","Aug 28, 2011"

Poured out of the bomber into my glass with a two finger khaki colored head. The head display nice retention in a cobweb like way and it does lace quite well. The brew color itself is wood stain brown. Aromas of malts and ripened fruits. Flavors are sweet and the ALC % is clearly masked (purposefully) by the on-display esters. Fruit flavors, most notably pineapple, in the middle, strong malt presence, and at the end enough hop presence to cut with out doing so sharply. Well thought out, but not subtle. Still, I do consider this as a good example of the style and a well balanced drinkable Barley wine. If you can find, you have to try it.","thekevlarkid","Aug 20, 2008"

As I got further into this brew and it warms I figured out the problem. The floral hop profile just doesn't lend itself to a Barleywine. It's more of an off-balance IPA that is too dark.

Sippable and modeerately worth savoring. Flavors don't 'wow' but have a nice layering, a balanced warmth, and are complex enough to give this a 'thumbs up'. Good effort by Santa Fe Brewing and, officially, my first New Mexican brew (47th to the Union, 39th on my own list of all 50 US states).","msubulldog25","Jun 19, 2008"

The head fades a bit but settles to a thin cap for the life of the beer. Smells a bit sweet, and a bit hot, a tiny bit bready, and with some spiced pear on the finish. The taste is not nearly so hot and the flavors are more integrated than is indicated by the nose. Some tangy, spicy malt, earthy hops, caramel, pear, honey , and a dry finish that caps it off nicely. Fairly dry and smooth and integrated in the mouthfeel. Pleasant to drink, but you can definitely feel the alcohol creeping up on you.","Georgiabeer","Jun 18, 2008"

Quite a bit more suspended goodness as you progress to the inevitable bottom of the container. The smell is also unique. I get a rich malty corn starch caramel and baked vanilla character. The presence of alcohol is more pronounced as this beverage warms up. Full bodied and adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is significantly influenced by the boozy side of the 10% ABV. I find the taste quite enjoyable..exactly what the doctor ordered tonight. Had this one on the WANTs list for some time now. Really glad that i found it at Whole Foods in Arlington,TX.

Unfortunatly this is where the excitement ended on this beer. The smell was of malts and a hint of fruity hops. But the first taste ended all enjoyment of this beer for me. It was very very strong on alcohol, that eventually gave way to some malt and hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light, but with the alcohol taste, it warms your palate too much.Overall this beer was not my favorite of this style.

Taste is slightly fruity maltiness, grainy, somewhat non descript malt sugars before a decent peppery hoppiness cuts through. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, slightly thick from the maltiness but cut nicely by the peppery hops and a warming alcohol bite.

Double Bastard, 120 minute ipa, and quite a few Russian Imperial Stouts, but none of these were as easy to drink as this. It is scary to me that this beer is so good and so easy to drink.

If aging could kill that aftertaste this would be a real winner. The label was a little pretentious as it stated that this beer would someday define the American barleywine style. Um, no.
