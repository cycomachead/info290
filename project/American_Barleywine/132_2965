Solid bitterness.  More bittering hops than aromatic ones.  Body is creamy, full, and smooth.  Excellent American barley wine.  Textbook.","goochpunch","Mar 02, 2015"

Pretty easy to drink though it is definitely a big beer and needs to be slowly sipped and enjoyed. Alcohol is pretty well hidden considering the strength of this brew.","dbrauneis","Feb 13, 2015"

Overall a great beer, the smell and taste are far from each other. When I first opened it I thought it would be overly sweet but instead it's smokey hoppy malty, and incredibly smooth.

Pours hazy ruby brown under a rocky light tan head that produces thick lace. Has a big malt nose with dark sugars and some sherry notes. Begins with a touch of sweet malt and then goes through three or four versions of hop bitterness and spiciness ending in a long lingering hop bitterness riding on smooth caramelly malt. A big alcohol palate joins with some heavy duty bitterness to balance the big, rich sherry malt flavors. Lingering bitter alcohol finish. The alcohol is warming but not overly hot or solventy.","pat61","Jan 09, 2015"

4.09,2,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"2013 vintage, black ceramic flip-top bottle poured into a tulip. Note that the recipe of this beer appears to change depending on the year. A murky ruddy root beer brown brew with a copious quantity of creamy, frothy light tan head. Nice aroma of resinous citrus/tropical hops (this incarnation includes Centennial), orchard fruit, dark bread, cotton candy, cacao powder, barroom nuts, and a tinge of umami. Classic American barleywine. Pine, orange, and mango mingle with rich toffee, pretzel, chocolate, pears, apples, black tea, donut, and a little light molasses. Robust malts and equally assertive resinous hops, with emergent walnut, pine needle and astringent tree bark elements cutting what might otherwise be a cloying sweetness. Thick bodied and smooth but not quite syrupy with low end carbonation. Finishes rather dry, more piney hops and citrus rind. Hits all the expected notes: Fruity, aromatic, richly sweet but with a counterbalancing bitterness. Some IPA tendencies. Perhaps less complex than other iconic examples of the style.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 13, 2014"

I found the Rogue to have a good "weight" to it, though I thought it would be a tad heavier. The taste was spot on with vanilla and coco notes. The only reason I did not give this a 5 rating was the price. $16 is steep for this beer, I think it's due to the bottle though","Brubzy","Oct 31, 2014"

4.2,4.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage bottling, 10.75%. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, floral, grass, pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of citrus/earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome American barleywine. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 16, 2014"

That said, this bottle that I reviewed was literally the bottle right next to the last one, and it was infinitely better.  The previous bottle showed stupid amounts of metallic character that was hard to ignore. This one had very little. Just goes to show the volatile difference that can happen from bottle to bottle. Whether or not I'd be willing to gamble on another bottle of this vintage? Probably not.","TheSixthRing","Jun 25, 2014"

I'm thinking it might have been slightly past its prime (14 years is quite a long time I know) but it was enjoyable. The alcohol had all but vanished but there was some subtle bitterness that felt out of place. It was definitely better when it was closed (cold) then after I had let it sit. The warmer it got the worse I felt it got. I have another bottle that was cellared in 2010 so I think I'll try that shortly and compare the two.

There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

3.45,-14,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"7oz bottled in 2000 Sampled in 2012 so it's got a bit of age on it. Pours a mostly clear dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. The aroma is filled with caramel dark sugar and lots of dark fruit with some alcohol and a bit of wet cardboard. The flavor is dark sugars and cherries and raisins with a healthy dose of warming alcohol. There's an earthy herbal component in there as well. Medium to thin body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet harsh alcohol type mouthfeel. Its nice to be able to try a 12 year old bottle of barleywine. I've had fresher bottles of this and felt the alcohol was a bit too present, and this proves that age won't fix that. The twist off cap probably didn't help much, but there was still a little bit of carbonation. Nice to try.","johnnnniee","Jul 18, 2012"

The Beer was poured out into a wine glass. The beer had a few bubbles left but not nearly as much as any fresh brew. The color of the beer was a reddish brown color with some sediment floating around in it. The smell of the beer was pretty boozy, with some wine like aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer has some malty fermented fruit flavors in there. There is also a heat in there coming from the ABV. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty thin now and flat.

The aroma was rich, light notes of alcohol and a ton of bready malts. Hints of pine resin hops and a nice, touch of grain mingling in throughout the profile.

4.07,1.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a wide mouthed goblet, the beer has a cloudy, almost opaque appearance, with a muddled amber-tan color. Good flow of carbonation present, which is good, because this appears a bit on the thick and viscous side. A very thin film of head that dissipates to residue very rapidly. The beer has initial smells of grapefruit and cotton candy, both characteristics very sweet and forward. Deeper smells reveal more citrus, but also some light spices. The beer has a sour backbone of flavor, but the cotton candy sweetness remains present in the flavor, although much lighter than the smell may infer. Some definite notes of hops, both in the green bitters and slight citrus (grapefruit) notes. Also, a boozey flavor to the beer, although not unpleasant. The beer has a viscous and oily/slick mouthfeel, as it appeared that it would. The aftertaste is slightly sour and toasted. The ABV can also be gleamed from the aftertaste, again not entirely unpleasant. The finish puckers the mouth and dries the tongue a little bit, but that makes it all the easier to follow with another mouthful. It would be difficult to consume this one en masse, and your head might pay for it the next day. Ultimately enjoyable Barleywine!!","GarthDanielson","Feb 05, 2011"

Tastes of massive amounts of malt; caramel, a bit of toffee with the intense juicy citrus of Centennial hops combined with the pine resin character of Chinook. Very smooth. The lubricious mouthfeel enhances the drinkability (for a barleywine.) I love the combination of Chinook hops and caramel and Munich malts. The bitterness is intense and gets abrasive towards the finish. High alpha hops and alcohol mix for a very assertively bitter, slightly "hot" finish. Haven't had one of these in really long time. Still a great, intense barleywine. Amazing how assertive the bitterness is with nearly two years of age.

The color is really fantastic on this one, a deep reddish brown with a fantastic, yet thin, layer of head that doesn't quit. The aroma is also quite good. Normally, I expect barleywines to be overwhelmed with malt character, but there is a fair amount of hop quality here as well. Upon first sip, the beer reveals itself to be viscous, yet pleasantly smooth. There's a good amount of malt here, but again, the hops manage to shine through. I'd be doing this beer a great disservice if I didn't mention that this is likely the best experience I've had with a barleywine to date. Overall, Old Crustacean is very drinkable for a barleywine, although you probably wouldn't want to have more than one or two glasses, as the 11.5 ABV might sneak up on you pretty quick.

I have had fresh bottles of this beer before, when it tastes like acetone and vomit, and the two years that were supposedly on this keg improved it vastly. Both the hops and alcohol have mellowed significantly and the malt character has become darker and more complex. There is still enough of the resinous hops and sharp alcohol left to keep the beer intense and lend it a boozy quality. This was quite good, but I suspect that there is still room for improvement. I can't wait to crack open the five year old bottle that I have in my cellar.","nickfl","Jan 04, 2010"

The taste is both hop flavor and chocolate malt competing for dominance. I think it is very well balanced throughout the flavor profile.

I thought I was in for a malt bomb with lots of malted milk ball flavor, but that wasn't the case. Aroma was fruity, bourbon, and lots of maltiness. Still thinking that I was getting a malted milk ball. However, flavor was very mellow while still being highly malty and smooth with some nice bourbon notes. Quite good.","BeerBelcher","Nov 01, 2008"

That being said, Rogue is also one of my favorite breweries, and I just couldn't see passing this one up any longer. This is the 2007 Vintage. Pours a chocolaty brown into a snifter. A huge, bubbly dark tan and brown head sits atop and fades slowly leaving a thin, but consistent lace around the glass. Smells of sweet and dark chocolates, dark fruits (prunes and plums) yeast, big sweet malts and bread. Tastes rich and creamy, chocolaty and sweet, with an unexpected but very welcome hop hit at the end. Alcohol is fairly well hidden by the complex tastes which also include the big malts and caramel candy finish. Mouth-feel is full bodied, but goes down pretty easy. The carbonation explodes after a slight swirl. This is redemption in a glass, and I can't believe I waited this long to enjoy this first class Barleywine.","stephens101","Aug 22, 2008"

Very dark brown with a nice creamy head. Great aroma, hops all over the place. A bit of a sweet note on the nose as well. The taste of this beer was perfect. Nice smooth start, a little sweet, kind of fruity but then the hops kick in. Wow, great hop note. Balances the malt sweetness perfectly and complements the alcohol zing and warmth nicely. Not a beer for those who don't like hops. A neat take on the barleywine. This one will be heading for the cellar very soon!

Smells big, bready, and slightly oxidized, but it is slight and the overall aroma is very nice. The taste is huge, and surprisingly bitter and dry, Much of the sweetness has gone out of this one and created more of an old ale. Very little citrus or oine flavors, just an earthy bitterness underlying the malty notes. The extreme earthiness of this one makes it a bit hard to drink too much of it, and that same bitterness coats the mouth as well.

This was served from a refrigerated keg, and therefore too cold for a barleywine, but I was still able to pick up armoas of sweet caramel malts, bourbon soaked cherries and a menacing pine forest of hops. The huge, sweet, malty beginnings of this first sip are immediately thrashed into oblivion by the most massive, earth-scorching hop bitterness I've ever encountered. Woody, pine-struck acridity lingers infinitely...or so it seems. I don't know when this one was kegged, but it sure as hell tastes fresh to me. A bubblegum sweetness tries to emerge as the beer warms. Huge, chewy mouthfeel; medium body. My impression is that this is a promising barleywine if properly aged for a number of years -- like at least three. Right now, at least, the drinkability has to be low, because the hops are almost too obnoxious to really enjoy. I'm all for palate expansion, but beer drinking shouldn't ever feel like a chore.","orfeu","Mar 26, 2006"

Taste is bold, with good hoppiness on top of the cherry, currant, and plum fruitiness. Plenty of port wine grapes and a touch of hot alcohol are also in the mix. Tastes are complex, but not exceptionally well balanced. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, not cloying or oppressive, but promoting a finish that seems to go on forever.

The head then quickly fell to a ring. Smelled of sweet caramel malt with some milk chocolate, prunes, maraschino cherries and a solvent alcohol that was mixed into a resinous pine hops. The flavor began with an up front dry pine then picked up some sweet cream and a delightful woody barley. Finished with a dark chocolate and some intense dry piney hops with an alcohol burn. Unfortunately, I inhaled through my mouth while drinking and choked on solvent vapors. The mouth feel was medium bodied and sticky with a light carbonation.

Super bitter hops and super sweet fruity malts... I guess that's balanced?? A bit thick and syrupy on the palate. A little more carbonation would ties everything together a bit better.

Lots of strong alcohol flavor, the hop equivalent to a rack of brontosaurus ribs and phenomanally large malt on top of that. This beer is all about a melding of extremes. I don't know if an all-around larger beer has ever been brewed. There is no doubt in my mind that this would definitely make Fred Flinstone's car tip over.","TastyTaste","Jul 14, 2005"

Smells like everything: malt, molassas, hops, grapes, prunes, raisons, chocolate, toffee, berries...the list goes on. Tastes like (see smells like...) with emphasis on the dark fruits; add dates, figs, almonds, and red wine. Very agressive with the flavoring and bittering hops: no punches pulled here. Strong body, thick and a bit oily. Quite chewy and almost nausiating (in a good way if there is such a thing.) Finishes anything but dry. Flavors fade slowly. I opened one three days ago and I'm still sipping on it. All in all, a good complex Barley Wine. Too abrupt now, but is certain to meld and mature with time.

A lot of malt at the outset upon tasting, developing to a plum/raisin taste and other dark fruits, thence to an alcohol warmth and finally to a surprisingly hoppy finish for a barleywine.

Still hops dominate big time, especially in the finish. The 120 IBUs are definently noticed here.

Huge, floral hops come out mid-palate, becoming bitter towards the back of the mouth. The body is substantial - syrupy, sticky, and everything you'd expect from a huge beer from Rogue.

Thereis also a carmelized sugary feel along with what I percieve to be some molasses notes.

Theres a beautiful smooth to bitter transition for mouthfeel. Drinkability is tremendous..so smooth, adventurous. An alcohol warmth comes to the chest not as immediately other high quality barley wines but, no worries, it certainly presents itself in time. I'm appreciating Chinook hops more and more.

It sounds weird, but that is the closest thing i can think to describe it. Just foot. After i got used to that smell i found some burnt somethings with a bit of hop and malt in there too with some peppery fruits. The taste is overridingly alcoholic at first, with an incredible amount of chalky bitterness after that.

So dark and pine filled, tons of hoppiness in there! Darkness, burnt toast, peppery and warming alcohol. Not much carbination going on, which I like, just such a good mouthfeel to it.

I am not a huge fan of Barley Wines, I do like Stone Old Guardian on occasion, but during a recent trip to Vegas, I dropped into my favorite watering hole there, The Freakin Frog. I found, quite by accident, they had tapped a keg of 1996 Vintage Old Crustacean, a week or so prior and there was still some left. I decided to give it a shot, and boy what an unbelievable beer this is!! No head to speak of, but a beautiful dark amber color, no carbonation to speak of either. Strong malty backbone, very strong on carmel, but before it got "sweet", the hops took over and finished smooth as velvet with a warm alcohol bite. I would love to have some of this for winter, it is truly a belly warmer. I immediately ceased any thoughts of drinking anything other than this for the remainder of the evening, which was not too awful long, considering the high ABV of 11% + who knows what has happened over the last 8 years.

In a pint glass, the beer was a rich and very deep and attractive mahogany brown, and was topped by a thin light brown head. The nose was extremely complex and wonderful with exploding textured roasty, mushroomy, spouted-grain, woody maltiness. Irratic plumes of varnish-like alchohl caught my nose from time to time. Sweet notes are present but stuggle to escape. On the palate, a big roasty, peaty malt profile with some nice cocoa nuances reared back to release searing scotch-like alcohol flavors that warmed the throat on the way down. A huge complementing bitterness came through this in the finish leaving lingering roasty, lightly astringent nutty notes. The medium body felt good for the flavors and character of the beer. As for drinkability, it suffers considerably due to the completely detached alcohol thoughout....I sipped it like as if it were scotch, and I barely got through the bottle. Despite this harshness, the nose was amazingly developed and good flavors made it enjoyable for a while. This aged barleywine was quite intense.","HiroProtagonist","Jul 29, 2004"

Hop bitterness followed by a cleansing alcohol bath, a touch of malt, and palate stripping fruity hops leaving the mouth wanting more. It's not completely unbalanced, but it wants you to think that it is. The dry mouthfeel coupled with the mouth-watering hop bitterness attempts to balance it all out, but falls just a bit short. I think more residual sweetness would make this a killer barleywine. Very drinkable, but the flavor is in that grey area between American double IPA and barleywine.

Yeah right! I am betting the ABV is more around 14-15% at this point (bottled in 2002). This beer has a great texture; creamy, smooth, but has some kick at the ass-end due to the alcohol.

The foretaste is notably malty and quite sweet, but the sensation is quickly overrun by the intense hoppiness. Alcohol warming hits after the first few sips and the alcohol taste is evident in throughout the beer. The finish is all hopsany other subtlety is simply overpowered by the spicy bitterness.

There's a wave hello of hops in the middle, but fleeting, a sudden rise and quick goodbye. The hops may have passed on from age, but they did not mellow the beer as much as I would like: too sweet and too "strong" (the sense of the alcohol, as opposed to what the actual ABV is). If the beer was younger the sweetness might have more balance, but I fear what the alcohol prescence would be like. For barleywines, I'd prefer Old Salty, Bigfoot, or Blithering Idiot.

Still tastes pretty good, but its dominated by a toasted malt character and the alcohol seems to take over too much in the finish.

A vigorous swirl releases a few bubbles but there's no marbling, no collar... color is of "raisin juice," if there is such a thing--semi-opaque burnt umber color with cinnamon-colored highlights but very murky; vinous cling. I know this is (1) old and (2) a barleywine, but this is just not a good-looking beer. Smells better than it looks, anyway: dark chocolate and toffee superseded by dried fig/raisin; a touch of dessicant nutmeg or mace in the finish. Intriguing nosefeel of grape leaves is smooth but lacking in complexity. Taste begins with massive dried fig with a sudden surge of bitterness. More complex at the back of the palate with sweet dark chocolate and a suprising taste of coconut milk; through this there is a sustained, intense bitterness: extreme grapefruit rind with a touch of apricot (?). Initially harmonious flavors each have their turn, until the appealing bitterness crosses over into a powerful, unappealing acidity. Flat mouthfeel is more waxy than syrupy with a slight alcohol burn again turning acidic. The brew is, however, immediately soothing and warming. Well... I think time has helped the flavors distribute... but this sample was less than satisfying. I've had other '98's that have fared better. With one still in the fridge I'll see if the marks go up.

With deep tones of alcohol and slightly salty sweet shimmering notes of malt this beer is quite an experience bottled in 2002, just amazing.

On the nose I got some whiffs of caramel malts, spices, some fruitiness and pine hopssurprised I picked up these through the strong alcohol aroma. On the palate, the alcohol pierces the mouth with the nearly 12% abv, after the brew warms a bit it is easier to consume with different flavors coming acrosscaramel maltiness, toffee, spices, pine needles, and some nice sweet fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is some-what sharp. It took me about a ½ hour to finish this freakn 12oz beer. This is a monster of a beervery good brew, a slow sipper.","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 29, 2003"

4.89,21.9,4,5,5,4.5,5,"2001 Vintage: Pours a hazy, reddish body that appears dark brown when sitting upon the bar. The head is densely creamy and holds well, but it leaves only minor lace. Rich notes of fruity, deep caramel malt and piney hops rush forth to assault the nose. Astounding! The bouquet is almost good enough to simply enjoy on it's own. As I make my way through the serving, between sips I will often simply lift the glass to my nose and breathe in it's resiny goodness. Lingering over it's caramel sweetness and thin sharp fruit, one glass could easily be enjoyed for well over an hour (and I credit that towards its drinkability). But onward... it's full bodied with a very fine, gentle carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with rich caramel maltiness, followed quickly by a tour du force of hop flavor that's almost minty! It's intensely rich with notes of licorice and toffee at first, but the sweetness and berry-like fruitiness begin to ooze out as it warms. This is a potion that's best enjoyed slightly warm! Alcohol isn't really noticeable on the palate, although it's clearly there somewhere. It finishes dry with loads of hop flavor (pine, spruce, citrus) and bitterness, but some residual malt sweetness as well. It really coats the mouth and throat with hoppiness that's almost spicy and has the drying feel of smoke. That, coupled with what dark malt is there, teeters on appearing roasty. Although it's all right-there in front of you and easy to see, this beer is actually quite complex! It changes as it warms, and as your palate becomes overwhelmed. There's just no keeping up with it's brutal hop assault! And that's one of the reasons that Crusty is just as good whithin the year of it's release as it is with several years time. Well worth putting a case away to cellar!","NeroFiddled","Mar 16, 2003"

The smell was mostly floral hops, but with some malty aroma, too. The initial taste was dominated by hops, but eventually the sweet malt did make a valiant effort to come through. There was also a bit of oak in the flavor. The mouthfeel was a battle of sweet malt and strong hop bitterness which almost gave a chalky feel. The carbonation was low. The drinkability was good, and this ale grew on me as I finished the glass. "Old Crusty" as the bartenders called it.","UncleJimbo","Mar 16, 2003"

Raisins, chocolate, malt, floral (hops), malt, sweet, dark bread, malt, toffee, malt, toasted nuts and alcohol. Hops bite is prominent but held in check by a moutain of malt.

Fruitiness eeks in, combines w/ the sweetness resulting in a red licorice  - like note.  Mild vinous alcohol and hints of sherry are present as well. Although subdued, the waft of heaty fusels are a harbinger of a potent brew.  This warms my nostrils if I inhale deeply. Trace pine hop nose.  Rich and enticing aromawise.  Deeply toffeeish sweetness hits the palate initially, but quickly gives way to assertive, sharp, yet clean hop bitterness that more than offsets what would be a cloyingly sweet malt profile.  Caramel notes, and nutty sweetness akin to peanut brittle provide contrast to the quenching bitterness mid palate. Hop flavor has faded into muted citrus.  Full in body and very dextrinous in mouthfeel, partially due to the apparent high final gravity.  Finishes w/ lingering hop bitterness and residual sweetness on the lips.  Enveloping alcohol warmth grows progressively stronger throughout.  Old Crusty 2000 has matured wonderfully.  The hop bitterness is still sharp, but the rich buttery malt is not overshadowed.  Intense and absolutely delcious.","marc77","Sep 11, 2002"
