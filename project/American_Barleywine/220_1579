Hoppy beer, smooth, medium strength body, little bit of heat on the finish. a little sticky from the malts, mostly some toffee or caramel sweetness and these balance with citric, hoppy, earthy flavors and touches of dark fruits.  Pretty well built and strong, holds up and I like the extra hop notes.","clayrock81","Monday at 07:14 PM"

4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/19/2015. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, plum, apple, citrus rind, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, dark malt, and fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, plum, apple, citrus rind, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, citrus rind, plum, apple, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops, dark malt, and fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light-moderate warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible American barleywine style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops, dark malt, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV, even with the noticeable warming finish. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2015"

Taste is dark malt, brown sugar, caramel, raisin & alcohol booziness, tropical fruits, orange & leafy floral hops. Some grass & pine. Sweet throughout the sip but with an alcohol bitter finish & spice which linger in the aftertaste & there become increasingly drier, hoppy & bitter.

The smell, however is a different animal. And yes, this is definitely a different animal. Big malts: lots of caramel, less toffee, more biscuit. Barely any bitterness detected, although there is a hint of citrus, maybe a grapefruit zest thrown in. But there is definitely some butter here. Not butterscotch, mind you, but butter. I'm not quite sure what to make of that, but sure, why not? Maybe a touch of golden raisins mixed in with the butter, rum, and caramel. Very sweet in that respect, but it's kept in check somehow by an invisible and undetectable hop cone somewhere. The body feels sticky but medium in quality. And lo! There is carbonation despite not showing up at first glance. Effervescent is too strong of a word here so I'll say it is decently carbed. Overall, not bad. Not one of my favorite barleywines.","DmanGTR","Jan 03, 2013"

The near-11% ABV mellows quite nicely, leaving the complex, fruity flavors in tact while not compromising the bitter hop resins within. The booziness seems more restrained as well, allowing more subtle malt flavors to shine though. I wish I had another bottle to open in a year or two.","Gambrinus1184","Dec 22, 2012"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruit and a bit of sweet booze. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some bready/grainy malt noticeable. It's very sweet and malty. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's very smooth and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, and at just $4.99 a bomber it's definitely worth trying!","bluejacket74","Dec 19, 2012"

Pours a dark reddish brown amber with a one finger light tan head that dissipated quickly to a ring around the glass. Intense hops on opening the bottle with a great aroma of herbal and piney hops and caramel malt. Hops dominate the beginning of the taste, then sweet malt and fruits develop. Finish is sweet malt, somewhat boozy, light hop finish. Creamy medium bodied. Interesting and fun to drink. One of my favorite barley wines.","LiquidAmber","Jul 29, 2012"

Lots of the sticky sweets and very prevalent booze. This one is a really slow sipper based on that alone, but the sticky, chewy mouthfeel slows you down even more. Not inappropriate for the style, but also not perfect. For me I was worn out before finish my 12oz. pour, but I loved the first half of it! Definitely worth a shot.","TheRealBigC","Jul 27, 2012"

Pours a reddish-amber hue with roughly a finger's worth of quickly dissipating head. Leaves but the thinnest and sparsest lacing behind. The nose gives hints of vanilla, caramel, and some raisins. It is a very very boozy scent indeed. The taste follows closely behind the nose. Lots of prominent roasted caramel flavors, vanilla, malt...BOOZE. God forbid this stuff makes you burp. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but hot. The tail end of each sip departs with a tad of bitterness. Overall, a solid brew. Perhaps I'd have rated it a bit higher, but having had the likes of Abacus, BA Naked Evil, and some others recently, this one doesn't quite stack up as well.","Retail1LO","0"

A nice beige head up top with life and able to stick to the glass. Smell is very malty at this point in the game. No hops in the nose to speak of. Sweet candi with sugars in the nose with some deep caramel and toffee. Some English malt is noted along with a faint hit of alcohol. Taste is pretty good. Looking for any hops, I was unable to find any, they faded in the 3 years. No hops brings out the malt ansd yeast and shows off it's English ingredients. Candi, light chocolate, and grain from all dat der barley. Sadly alcohol comes into play and I can taste it which detracts a bit. Feel is above medium and is a bit sryupy, carb is light off this tap, but the ride is pretty smooth, except for the burn. All in all a nice B-Wine to go to on the cheap.

The aroma is all sorts of awesome, lots or orange marmalade, and sweet floral notes. There is a cordial or liqueur note that maybe I can’t place my finger on so well.... maybe cherry, maybe sloe gin? Either way I like it. There are fairly strong boozy tones present but not in an annoying way. Earthy and toasty notes add to the background of the bouquet. The flavor is nice with plenty of sweet molasses and cordial. There are some earthy hops that are really nice and at about one year are still very strongly present. Mid glass this starts slipping away from me when a sort of odd boozy on bitter fight occurs, but then I got the ground aspirin note, once that’s been introduced to the palate try as you may to erase it from your mind it will come within inches of ruining an otherwise very nice beer every time. I loved the way this smelled, and I liked the way it tasted too... had I not picked up that aspirin note I think I would have scored it a lot higher...

Nose is sweet caramel with bitter orange peel, even more bitter hops, and a hint of honey. Flavor starts off with brown sugar and honey sweetness, and moves to bitter orange peel and hops. The body is big and thick with average carbonation and a long bitter hops and brown sugar finish. This is very hoppy for a barley wine, but still nicely balanced. The alcohol is hardly noticed until the bit of burn in my chest.","wedgie9","Jun 21, 2011"

Smells of citrus zest and pine and caramel malt. Taste is of sweet malt balanced by citrus zest/pine hops. There is a bit of brown sugar and caramel that comes out too. Mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. A lower level of carbonation makes for a slightly thick and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine that tastes better than it smells. Another good value for the price (I paid $3.99 for a bomber) from Lagunitas.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 09, 2011"

Smells like all my favorite beers in one. The sugary and fruity kick is probably most dominant. Taste is a bit more subdued but still good. Dirty and earthy hoppiness with a twist of grapefruit and orange peel. Nice lingering bitterness all around. Nice caramel backbone holds it together nicely. I feel it could use a bit more carbonation personally. Just a tad too bit flat and oily for me but otherwise a great beer especially at $5 per bomber.","generalnotsew","Jun 09, 2011"

It's like a far less hoppy, way less interesting version of most other American Barleywines. Hopefully it's just this keg that's problematic. It isn't like Lagunitas to miss this badly on a beer. Drinkable, but awkward and mostly unejoyable.","Reaper16","May 14, 2011"

Really a nice looking beer. But the smell is what did it for me. It took me a good long while to figure it out...and it's those butterscotch candies I ate as a kid in my grandparent's house in NE Philly.

4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured a very hazy dark, burnt ruby amber. Very intresting hue as the reddish tint was very noticeable even though the haze made it almost opaque. A one inch head formed on the top upon pour, that faded almost immediatly. What was left was a thin film of decent quality lace that circle around the glass. Smell was very sweet, caramel sugars hitting almost immediatly. The deeper smell after some warming indicated a nice bready, earthy malt back with a hint of alcohol, which at 9%abv and being a barleywine should be expected. The taste for me was just too light. I expect barleywines to make me sit down and to be a definite sipper, but this just did not have the fullness I would have expected. The finish on it was very dry, and did last a good bit though. The taste itself was very hoppy, with piney flavors the most noticeable, a slight malt back was trying to form with flavors of grain and bread, but was just too thin to really be noticed. There was a huge amount of carbonation, again for a barleywine, on this one. Lots of fizz and contributed to the feeling of lightness. Overall this gave me more of an impression of a well balanced double IPA. May improve and bring out some flavors as it sits, but a little younf still for me.","mikesgroove","May 05, 2011"
3.28,-19.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into an oversized snifter, the beer is a deep, crystal copper coloring that is very dark in the deeper parts. The head settles into an off-white, foamy, light head that is amber-tinted and rests into about a half an inch. Nose is tangy-sweet, with a sugary-sweet caramel base that has a slightly sour tone to it. The beer is viscous and oily slick in mouth, with flavors of tangy sweet and slightly sour dark fruit flavors. It almost tastes like a little raisin and a little prune juice, with a healthy dose of pineapple. Not much on the spice to help balance it, although there is the slightest hint of hops in there at the end, sometimes. Almost overpowering, with some slight boozy characteristics. The beer has the tangy sour flavors into the aftertaste, and they slowly fade in mouth with a long lingering finish. This one is interesting, but definitely an acquired taste. It would be interesting to see how it ages, if anyone was so inclined.","GarthDanielson","Apr 30, 2011"
4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: The easiest thing to do here is compare this with Bigfoot.

4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: After having had the cask and draft version of Lagunitas Gnarlywine I was looking forward to catch a bottle with mixed expectations. This sits somewhere in between. It lacks the very rich and complex malt and hop profile of the cask, but offers a much longer and pronounced range than the version I had on tap. Tap may have suffered from being a bit too cold but found it a bit blah. However this bottle is one of the best fresh barleywines I have had this season with good memories of the cask experience in the horizon. I'll gladly age a couple of these bottles to see how they turn around. And again the price/quality ratio is tremendous.","Daniellobo","Apr 22, 2011"

4.35,6.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep ruby red-orange hue with an off white creamy head. Off white/cream head. Smells of fruity hops, malt, a little booze. The first sip is always a doozy with the beer. Burst of fruity, juice hops fallowed by a blanket of thick malt with a nice alcohol-warmth finish, almost a little bite of spice. Hints of peaches and apples covered in liquor. The alcohol in this one definitely finds its way throughout the beer and works nicely with the hops and the malts, separately. For the amount of malt in this it's pretty balanced, for a lagunitas beer. Ater several sips and letting this breath, the malts take a slight back seat to the hops, which begin to move their way towards the finish, but definitely don't sit quietly. A few months to mature wouldn't hurt the beer. It's good fresh, but changes from aging definitely benefit this eer.","100floods","Apr 09, 2011"

I was at my local Hy-Vee the other day trying to pick up some more World Wide Stout from Dogfish head ... a story for another day, but it was only $7.79/bottle and I only bought 2. When I got back they were all gone and they weren't getting any more. So after the disappointment wore off, I decided to try something new. The young kid working the department suggested a "different" hoppy beer. The thing that got me was "LIMITED RELEASE". Well I'm a sucker for limited release anything, so I picked up a Lagunitas GnarlyWine. My first reaction ... smells like Grapefruit ... and in my opinion ... beer should not smell like grapefruit juice. But the mouthfeel ... thick and chewy like 10w40 motor oil. This has the mouthfeel of a good stout. I stuck with it and tried to enjoy it on its own merit instead of "If it's not opaque, chewy and smells like coffee/chocolate I won't drink it" ... and I found out something. I can like a hoppy beer. It's not my favorite, but I like it. And if there are any hop haters out there that love stout, imperial stout, high ABV beers ... give this a shot. Heck, give it a couple of pints.

Smell is decent, big caramel malts, some herbal/piney hops, typical American Barleywine nose. Taste is quite good, with again big caramel and lightly toasted malt and big piney hops. I think this is where some of it falls short for me. It has huge flavors, but it lacks a bit of balance of sweetness vs. bitterness--the caramel is almost cloying. Very big flavors from the malt, but I feel as though it's almost unidimensional--I wish there was something spicy or something toasty or something else to back it up. MF is medium-full, creamy, smooth. Good stuff all-around. Drinkability is fantastic considering the ABV, though some alcohol comes out as it warms. A good beer, just barely misses the incredible mark in my book. Just a few tweaks could make this perfect, but, as such, it falls short.

Being a west-coast barleywine, I was expecting a hop bomb on the nose but it's actually pretty well balanced with the citrusy, piney hops being countered with a toasty, caramel maltiness. Just a hint of alcohol is perceivable. The initial taste confirms the nose that there is a good balance of malt and hops but there is a whole additional level of complexity. Grapefruit dominates with sweet, heavy dextrins as a backdrop that reflect caramel and dried fruits like figs and raisins. The alcohol is much more apparent in the taste than it is in the smell. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a reserved yet creamy carbonation and a dry, alcohol burn finish. I could have used some more west coast hops. Drinkability-wise, this would be a wise brew to sip and enjoy because the 11% could be rough. Excellent beer but I really was surprised that there was not a much bigger hop presence considering this is a west coast American Barleywine and it is only a 2009 vintage; there should be HUGE hops IMO.","gmfessen","Aug 03, 2009"

I know that sounds wierd, but its hard to explain. It is totally to style, but there is just no unique flare to it, I would like the balance to shift a little bit to be more clear. A touch more hops and a touch less stickiness. I don't know what it is but i just can't get really excited about this one.

The nose displays some restraint and doesn't push the sweetness too much, caramel, honey, tangerine and mandarin orange citrus, Indian spices, the plum, raisin fruit scents balanced by fresher apricot and peach notes, while knit into the whole well, there's more general hoppiness than many peers. Full-bodied, sticky, clings to your mouth pores like glue. Things more amplified here, the carbonation helps to separate the elements. The pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus gets out in front of the pack. Brown sugar, caramel and honey compact and not sweeter than any other component. There is a lively dark roasted coffee bean edge. Not bready or doughy really, you get a nice floral lift though. Here the apricot, peach, nectarine fruit leads, you might even discern more pineapple than raisin, date or fig flavors.

After a couple of sips you feel the sugar on your lips... sticky. You can tell there was some good crafting on this beer, as the extreme sweetness from the grains is balanced by the good amount of hoppiness. It is complex and hard to digest.

The flavor is malty and fruity from a mixture of cherries, sweet dark grapes, a mild raisin note, prunes and sugar coated plums.

4.5,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another GREAT beer experience from the guys at Lagunitas. After my last Lag brew (the imperial stout), I knew they would redeem themselves. This pours out a wonderful burnished copper body with light airy, sticky lace. The body is wonderfully clear and shines like brass in the light - great for a beer nearing the double digit abv level. The aroma is loaded with caramel malts, orange zest, and candy sweetness. Hops are definitely there, but big time citrus overtones. You can really get a feel for the richness of this beer in its nose. The taste is purely remarkable. Unlike many American barleywines which are overly rough on bitterness, this one carries a strong sweetness with semi-strong bitterness. Rich malts and caramelized sugar lead the way to a full and heavy mouthfeel. The smoothness is unexpected and begins with a creamy texture. A nice amount of carbonation is blended greatly with delicate and robust body. This is one of the best barleywines I have had in quite some time. Many barleywines take years of cellaring to create such balance and flavor, but this one is great right out of the chutes. For the price and quality, there are not many in this league. On top of it all, I am watching my 5 day old daughter Marlie wiggle and smile on the floor.","ALESwhatCURESya","Oct 22, 2008"

Taste is very syrupy-sweet at first with some toastiness from the malt. From all the grain used in this to give it such high sweetness and alcohol, you'd think they could at least give some complexity to the beer. Some citrus and pine hops come in the finish with an awkward bitterness. Hops bring more bitter than flavor to the table. Not overall disgusting, just heavy-handedly 2-dimensional (SWEET then bitter [kind of]). Mouthfeel is nice, however. Viscous, slick, and smooth. The body could be a little heftier though, I suppose.

The copper colored body was hazy and alive with lots of carbonation streamers. The dense head was good looking at two fingers thick, and growing. The smell was indicative of the generous hopping rate used in the recipe. It was not a piney and bitingly resinous hoppyness in the nose like the Bigfoot I had just yesterday. Instead these were softer, citric, and somewhat earthy hops. The taste was quite a bit sweeter than what I was expecting from one of the big boys from the West Coast. The residual sugars from the wort were still pretty evident, and the spicy and earthy hops could not provide and equal match up. The fruity richness of drizzled pears, apricots, and peaches came in wave after luscious sticky wave. Quite a full mouthfeel with a tinge of sourness in the finish.

The first whiff I took from from the bottle was very hoppy but now that it is in the snifter it doesn't seem overly hoppy actually a subtle sweetness. Whoa, sugary crazy flavor that ends very bitter.

Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, nice and soft sugariness from the malts, just a hint of drying hops in the finish along with a trace amount of warming alcohol, although the alcohol is extremely well balanced.

Theres notes of faint chocolate plums, honeysuckle perfume and strong glowing embers of melted raisins. Sugars and musky mens cologne. Hints of West Coast hops. Pour of clear fire red, with orange fringes a carmine center and a swirling head of tanned hide. Flavor is respectable, with heavy cream and sherry. Rich raisined malts are perfuse with more touches of chocolate and long basking rays of caramelization. In the backend, strong alcohol heat senses the humours and carries swift currents of tawny fruits and amber honey. The hops show in resin format, almost entirely, as this long linger subtle reminder of parching dryness and balancing parafin wax. Candy wrapper delight.

The palate is very rich and smooth. As you sip the first drops you get a rush of malts, fruit and a little bit if pine. Good strong finish, even after 22 oz of this one.

Some ripe dark fruit flow through towards the end while a hit of peppery alcohol comes through just to remind you its a barleywine. Overall the beer is fairly smooth, but the alcohol makes it a definate sipping beer. I enjoy this brew, but dont think I will be drinking this bomber very quickly.","sulldaddy","Mar 21, 2005"
3.85,-5.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: In its current state, it's intensely sweet, intensely hoppy--it's just intense, period. Maybe I'm having an off day, because I seem to be in the minority here, but IMHO it's raw and not particularly interesting at this point. I'd give it a year or so and come back to it.","WetCoaster","Mar 20, 2005"
4.1,0.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Taste: a huge mouthfull, an immense mouthfeel, all the richness of a well-crafted barleywine, dense cherries, plus alcohol, rich in malt, some hops, but so thick with classic barleywinish flavor...just like I like it..too tasty...very nice.","feloniousmonk","Mar 18, 2005"

Thanks to GClarkage for the great beer.","santoslhalper","Mar 16, 2005"
3.18,-21.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Great wall of China buttress of 1/7-inch head made of tightly formed, ionic column bubbles that stick, at least a little. Slight hazy orange/gold hue, though on the darker side, with a fair amount of action. Sweetly oozing melting sugar on nose with a pleasant hop bite and some juice characters  orange and raspberry. A somewhat tinny character is immediately noted on mouth, and an oddly empty malt profile. For a barleywine, I expected a great deal more complexity. Sweet aspects seem to dominate with just echoes of malt and a pin prick of hop presence. Bottom rung on the ladder for this style.","Truh","Mar 11, 2005"
3.78,-7.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"this is a concentrated beer, no doubt. strong, warming, and engaging. you could either love or hate the mouthfeel. it really is a syrup that coats everywhere. there's barely carbonation to be felt. overall a very nice brew--i didn't get a lot of complexity but it is pretty well balanced and perfect for sipping with a book. a whole bomber is a challenge though. probably best to share with someone.","studentofbeer","Mar 08, 2005"

3.96,-2.7,5,4,4,4,3.5,"This poured a beautiful crystal clear deep amber. The nice persistent head left a thick patterned lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, very fruity taste profile with cherries seeming dominant, at least to me. Reminds me of an Old Nick but with twice the power. Thickish mouthfeel is good for the style. Would rate higher for drinkability, but I find the taste, even though rated a 4 a bit too powerful at times and the cherry accents are quite strong. Still a very good BarleyWine style ale","Mark","Feb 16, 2005"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Update  I had this again with a year-old aged bottle and boy was it tasty. The sugars came up big and the hops took a step back, making it more like an English-style BW than an American. It was mighty good though, and I think as much as I enjoy this fresh I actually prefer it cellared and a little sugared up.","RoyalT","Feb 08, 2005"

4.73,16.2,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I had never known that this beer existed until i saw a row of 1999 vintage bottles in a liquor store that i frequent every few months or so. Thinking back to where I was in 1999, a junior in high school, it is amazing that this beer has been waiting for me until I was in my final year of college, makes it pretty special to drink. Pours a scarlet red color, slightly brown, with just a tiny bit of bubbly off white head. Smells vinous and strong, raisins and brown sugar abounding. Taste is smooth and mellow on the outset, which becomes a little rockier at the end where the now-mellowed hops make their presence felt. So many flavors will great you and morph into different ones as you take each sip of this fantastic beer. Mouthfeel is full and slick, low carbonation, and that is just fine. Drinkability is good, i don't think i could session it because of the fact that it so strong, and somewhat pricey. Do i recommend it, if you ever have the chance of buying it? A very enthusiastic "Yes".","TastyTaste","Nov 10, 2004"

3.2,-21.4,4,4,2.5,2,4,"Draught. Dark Copper. Pungent, fresh aroma, very reminiscent of Old Boardhead in its nose. Soft but sharp hops, along with fruity malt and caramel.

Very hoppy (grapefruit, pineapple, orange) along with lacking very sweet malt (fruit, cherries mainly, medicine and caramel).","Crosling","0"

4.35,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"What a gorgeous looking beer: mostly dark red with amber leanings. A medium-large, yellowish-cream, dense head. Light, sticky, foamy lacing. Beautiful. Tons of hops in the nose with sweet fruit and flowers. The front is fruity, hoppy goodness that gets out of the way for a sweet, sweet, malty, creamy middle. Very fresh, hoppy finish. Hugely bitter. There's a nice, slightly nutty aftertaste. I'm usually not crazy about really sweet beers, but the big hops here perfectly offset the thick sweetness for me. Delicious, big, California taste. Nothing pretentious, just a truckload of fresh hops and syrupy malt. The 9.7%abv is almost totally hidden.","kbub6f","Feb 02, 2004"
4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a reddish orange-amber color with a head that plays opossum at first and then erupts into a tower of foam that just doesnt ever want to recede. Floral hops and pine are the main aromas with some sweet and fruity malts in the background. Fairly full-bodied with a bit of a sticky texture in the finish. Taste begins with notes of sweet caramelized malt followed by some bready flavors that give way to a wonderful mix of raw hop leaves and grapefruit rind blended with some vanilla extract and warming alcohol. Bitter hop resins remain on the back of the tongue in a lasting aftertaste. A very nice barley wine and another winner from an outstanding (and somewhat crazy) brewery.","Morris729","Jan 30, 2004"
3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice color of clear deep ruby copper, finger high head of fluffy cheese cake, resides sort of fast, a thin ring maintains around the edge and lacing in thin whispy strings and sheets. Mild aroma of soft and sweet malts with some light dried hops that have a small pineyness, phenol yeasty notes and alcohol start to mop up all in its path as it warms. Taste has a nice warm backing finishing with some light hoppy bitterness thats fairly mild in a piney dried faction. The front is a little slippery and weak but draws through a nice light caramel malt and some slight sweetness til it gets to the end where it beefs up a bit and the hops come in. Feel has a thinnish start but picks up some nice medium body, nearly full with some of its carbonation and hops coming in just past the halfway point; and then dries out slowly with an abundant but calming piney resinous hoppyness thats quite nice and lasting. A decent barleywine, could use a bit of a nudge in its overall character with some thickness, but its pretty smooth and has a good little hop profile thats nice. Thanks to Gusler for the bomber!","tavernjef","Nov 21, 2003"
3.93,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"IMHO: I am not normally impressed with the very hopped American brews. This, however is the most well balanced beer of the genre.

It has that good fruity barleywine aroma with a hint of smoke, although I doubt it used smoke malt, I think it's the complexity tricking my nose. The flavor has mellowed a little more than it should, but it's still a tasty barelywine.","aracauna","Jul 02, 2003"

4.29,5.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer is slightly hazy and dark red/copper in color with a minimal off-white head. The aroma is wonderful -- very malty, bread and cookie aromas are dominant. Some floral hoppiness is noted but not as much as expected. Taste is sweet and malty. There is much more hop bitterness present in the flavor than in the aroma. It cuts through the sweetness and sticks around in the aftertaste. This beer is thick and "chewy" -- just how I like it.","philipt","May 13, 2003"

Hints of pineapple, bubble gum, and sweet malt, fresh and appetizing is this nose, start ambrosial, thick malt, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is spitefully acidic, the hops biting in their spiciness, the aftertaste alcohol bitter, long lasting and a nice Belly Warmer, and a fine beer from a fine brewery.","Gusler","Feb 05, 2003"
4.17,2.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"2002 version. Clear ruby hue. Topped by a initially thick, light roux colored head that recedes into a spotty layer. Sparse, oblong foam aggregates trail. Waft of rich, lightly buttery toffee upfront in aroma yields to notes of sweet, almond sprinkled croissants. Swirling releases heaty ethanol, raspberry like fruit esters and subtle tangerine citrus hops. Subtle, yet complex aromawise. Uniquely aromatic. Raw, dark, turbinado sugar esque sweetness is perceived at first in flavor, then widens into an enveloping, sweet tooth satiating impression of buttered biscuit drizzled with dark caramel syrup. A combination of candied almonds and fructose rich dried dates emerges mid palate, then is transiently contrasted by a snap of bright, sun drenched tangerine hops, which itself succumbs to the dominating malt presence. Hop bitterness is subservient and deferential to malt as well, leaving overall balance skewed towards sweetness. Approaching full and heavy in body, with a full, diluted Irish Cream like mouthfeel. Finishes sluggish, with lingering suggestions of carob and mellow, oily brittle. Gnarley Wine is a flavorful, unique brew. Despite the understated hop bitterness and dominant sweetness, it doesn't sit too heavily on the palate due to the depth of malt character. With a more pronounced hop profile this would be outstanding. It's a very enjoyable sipper, nevertheless.","marc77","Nov 29, 2002"

The only bad part of this beer was the smell. It was very suttle and not over powering. But, I could slightly pick up the aromoa of fruit and hops, along with a hint of sweetness. The taste, for me, was a big surprise. I could taste a complexity of citrus, fruit, hops and a hint of caramel on my first sip. This beer was not overpowered with an alcoholic bite, but the taste of alcohol was there, just not overpowering. Also, it had a smooth creamy bittersweet finish.","BeerManDan","Jul 15, 2002"

Beautiful, big malt nose.  Maybe a titch of brown sugar.  This beer seems to be predominantly malt and alcohol on the buds.  This beer is nearly 70 IBU but may have mellowed over 3 years.  The alcohol is not strong by any means.  The malt taste is very nice.  Deep caramel sweetness and almost a bock-like smoothness.  This is a pretty full bodied brew.

It is slightly sweet (not much) maltyness tends to overpower the bitterness. Unlike some other barley wine this one is ready to drink right out of the gate. I'm sure it will improve for a year or so but I do not see ageing this for extened periods. Unfortunately it is already gone for the year in my neck of the woods and I can't wait for its return.","mattmaples","0"
