3.97,-7.9,3.5,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,"2015 Vintage.  Appearance in the glass is a very unattractive murky brown color with a thin khaki head.  When held up to the light the beer transforms, displaying a very cloudy yet magnificent ruby red body.  Caramel and toffee dominate the nose, dark fruits, booze, subtle barrel notes.  Taste is extremely boozy, unbalanced.  Seems like a beer that requires at least a half year to develop in the bottle.  Getting the same toffee and dark fruits on the taste with minimal bourbon and vanilla.  There is an earthy/musty bitter hop aftertaste.  Need to track down another bottle to age and (hopefully) appreciate more.","Czarkazm","Mar 20, 2015"

3.98,-7.7,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,4,"Overall: I was a little wary of the barrel aging, uncertain of how strong the bourbon flavors would be, but actually it came out as a traditional, nicely balanced and complex barleywine. The alcohol is definitely a big player here and is stronger than I prefer. Especially considering the price I would rather get a pack of SN Bigfoot, but this is a nice sipper.","maedhros09","Mar 14, 2015"

It sucks that I can't get this brew regularly, yet it keeps me hoping for the next release of  Bourbon County Brand BarleyWine. The mouthfeel holds this brew back from dominating BCBBW. This is now one of my favorite Bourbon Barrel Aged BarleyWines. This is Recommended.","Shroud0fdoom","Sep 19, 2014"

Really can pull the bourbon barrel age out of it. One thing to note, I’m drinking mine at around 55° temp. My gf has hers refrigerated. Both are great. The colder one is slightly smoother with less alcohol burn, but not as flavorful. Another great solid barrel aged beer from CW.","kkleu357","Aug 23, 2014"

I appreciate how Central Waters didn't try to go too hop forward like some American barleywines, instead opting to let the malt and bourbon take center stage. A sipper though it may be, that only serves to prolong the enjoyment. The only other barleywine I've tried on par with this is Sucaba, so that comparison should pretty much speak for itself.","MaximalC","May 26, 2014"

Big caramel toffee aroma with vanilla, raisins, dark fruits, sweet smooth bourbon, oak, very slight oxidation. Flavor is sweet caramel bourbon, oak, dark sweet fruit, and a huuuge vanilla marshmallow finish that lingers a good while.

Mouthfeel is somewhat thinner than many barleywines but wonderfully creamy. Taste is surprisingly smooth - the aging seems to iron out the coarseness I find in many barleywines. Vanilla is the most prominent flavor. There's really just a hint of bourbon, which is a big plus in my mind, and the alcohol taste is slight as well.","Qbdoo","Apr 16, 2014"

The nose is sweet vanilla and rich caramel toffee: at this point, I'm ready to take a bath in this stuff. Taste delivers what the nose promised: lots of sweet vanilla bourbon up front, then transitions into caramel maltiness, and finishes with a strong tart hoppiness. Very tart and hoppy on the end. Mouthfeel was a delight: chewy, creamy, and somewhere between medium- and high-carbed. A fantastic BA barleywine: it has all the best aspects of a english-style BA barleywine up front, and the intense hoppy tartness you see in american barleywines provides a great contrast at the end.

Unfortunately, even though I enjoy American Barleywines, I'm just not a huge fan of aging these in bourbon barrels. I find that the bitter hop flavors clash a bit on my palate with the sweet, boozy notes and the malt is not allowed to work its magic. (Now English Barleywines - good gracious! Those are custom-made for bourbon-barrel-aging!) Nevertheless, I continue to try these as I come across them (or as wonderful traders - like Ri0 - bless me with their generosity) in hopes that my palate will eventually accept them.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 06, 2014"

4.36,1.2,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"so there does exist a barley wine that lives up to its hype, and it is this central waters offering. hazy and rich caramel colored beer with an awesome white head over an inch tall and lasting all the whole time. it smells like caramelized grain sugar, raw sugar, toffee dessert, and booze, but only just enough. the nose and taste both suggest ridiculous barrel influence, i mean, tons of vanilla, tons of char, tons of everything, sugars too but its not too sweet. i get good bourbon all the way through, with that oaky earthen character and all the vanilla in the world, while the booze remains way back, but persistent enough for me to want to let this warm and drink it slowly, although neither the body nor the sugar makes this hard to drink. smooth down, long vanilla finish, like creme brûlée in many ways, to rich for a ton of it, but highly appreciated in reasonable doses. a good twelve ounce to share, and finally a central waters beer worthy of its high praise, this is wonderful barleywine, as good as american made english style gets.","StonedTrippin","Mar 02, 2014"

Pours a ruby amber color with a small, off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is much more citrusy and hoppy than I expected. At first I get citrus hops and bitter aromas, followed by sweet, bourbon booziness. Kinda reminds me of the BA Bigfoot I had a few weeks ago. Dark fruit aromas and a bit more bourbon. Taste is hoppy as well...very interesting. After reading reviews of this beer, I was not expecting this. Maybe I drank this one too soon or the 2013 version is more hoppy? Citric, hoppy bitterness up front...immediately followed by delicious barrel flavors. Lovely bourbon with vanilla, coconut, and toffee. Not very boozy for what the ABV is...very smooth. The combo of the hoppy bitterness, the citrus, the bourbon, and the oak make this one quite enjoyable. Drinkability very high. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, smooth, and full-bodied. Overall, I don't know what it is about this beer... but, the only other "hop-forward" BA barleywine I have had was BA Bigfoot. I can't imagine the base beer for this one being as hoppy as regular Bigfoot... I'm so confused right now. This beer threw me in a direction I was not expecting, but it was very delicious.... I guess I'm somewhat disappointed because I was hoping for a BA barleywine that wasn't "familiar". Can't rate it on that though.","DovaliHops","Beers"

It's rich presence carries from aroma to flavor though the smooth feel rounds out the alcohol nicely for a bourbon barrel beer that's quite drinkable fresh.

In any case, very well done bourbon barrel aged barleywine. Also, I suppose you could call this one "hot" or "boozy" at this stage. Personally, I enjoyed it like that, but I'm thinking it should start to mellow after little while (say 8-12months). Might even hit a sweet spot.

There was a rich, thick caramel, bourbon aroma along with dark fruit like plums, good amount of toffee, and vanilla. The flavor is quite rich and fairly boozy from the bourbon especially when the beer warms up, but nice. There’s a ton of dark fruit- plums, figs, dark grapes, dates- in the flavor along with a ton of vanilla, oak, sweet booze, and toffee. Sticky medium mouthfeel.

I would personally say that the bourbon flavor almost slightly ruins the delicious taste of Charlie's Y2K catastrophe ale (which I am pretty certain is the barley wine used for this).

Central Waters advertised the fact that with this year's Bourbon Barrel Stout, they aged it for twice as long in the bourbon barrels. There were rumors that all of their bourbon barrel beers were aged for twice as long as in previous years. Whatever the case, this year's version of the BB Barleywine is so much smoother than last years! I will have to do a side by side comparison to be sure but as good as last year's was, there was always a slight harshness to each sip. That is totally gone this year as the bourbon integrates so much better with all of the wonderful barleywine flavors in this beer.","mjpolzin","Jan 23, 2012"

4.42,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Big thanks to seeswo for the trade. Served at 53 degrees in a tulip. Bottled on January 2011 indicated on the label. Pours a bright amber hue with candy apple highlights. Clarity is almost translucent, but there's a slight haze. Head is an 1/8th of an inch, loose and cream-colored and immediately dissipates into a thin band around the shoulders. Some short strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer! Bourbon, buttery notes, sugary and candied fruits. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's definitely an alcohol presence here - it's still a little hot but not in a bad way. There's also some hops bitterness that manifests towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a slightly oily consistency that is somewhat masked by an assertive carbonation. There's definitely some residual alcohol heat. Overall, this is a top notch beer. I'm glad I opened it but would love to see what a few years does to it.

4.36,1.2,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine pours a completely opaque mahogany, with a towering pile of light tan foam sitting atop the beer. Its shoots past four fingers in height, settles back down to about that, and just sits there. It legitimately took five mininutes for the foam to recede, and leaves gobs and gobs of lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is very heavy on caramelized sugar and toffee, with the only evidence of the time spent in barrels being a light touch of vanilla that stays in the background. The flavor brings the barrel aging a bit more into focus. Toffee and lightly burnt sugar are still the foundation of the flavor profile, but the vanilla secondary note from the aroma is joined by a pleasant, mild bourbon taste. The mouthfeel is solid, a full, rich body paired with carbonation that just keeps the beer from being syrupy, yet lets the malt shine. I love me a barrel aged barleywine, and this is one of the better ones I've had.","axeman9182","Aug 26, 2011"

To a lesser degree I get some piney hoppiness and orange peel as well. The flavor doesn't back it up. The flavor is dominated by malts, which should be good, but I'm not getting the balance of hops I thought I smelled.

The oak and vanilla bourbon characteristics offered by the oak barrel are shining through in this beer but not overpowering. You can still taste the caramel and light hop offerings as well. Some butter notes are also picked up in the flavor that add to the sweetness. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a suiting low amount of carbonation.

Visible effervescence sustains a shallow off eggshell collar briefly while a nice amount of spotty Belgian lacing adorns the glass. The smell is aggressive, and with high standard, quite classic. A vanilla character from the oak treatment adds nicely to the vibrant sweet malty caramel butterscotch toffee brown sugar molasses notes. Really nice!! The flavor is very pronounced... and sweet. The full bodied texture vividly supports the overall experience. The initial mouth feel was exceptionally well carbonated..especially for a beverage of this style. Full bodied without being syrupy, the texture REALLY adds a ton of value to this one. The flavor is quite NICE as it reflects the nose yet has a surprisingly black licorice thing going on, especially in the really enjoyable aftertaste. I REALLY ENJOYED considering this one!!!

This is a very fresh barley wine, with hops in the finish and big sweetness upfront. A bit boozy, bourbony and just generally, a beer that needs some time to calm down. From experience, it doesn't take long for this beer to mellow quite a bit. Based off of this fresh and generally over time, this is a barley wine for people who like them relatively sweet. Very solid levels of carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. In it's current state, it's not the most drinkable beer. As it mellows, the sweetness emerges, putting a ceiling on the drinkability. In general, this beer has well integrated bourbon without being a bourbon/booze bomb, that is on the sweeter side of an already sweet style.

The taste when at the perfect temperature, which I assume to be the intended serving temperature, is a wonderful god like nectar, either above or below the tannins or booze come out respectively.

Great nose with the bourbon integrated well on the nose. Taste was outstanding. Definitely could taste the bourbon barrel aging on this but thought the malt and barrel aging had really integrated well. Had this a couple times from the bottle a couple months ago and I thought it was somewhat disjointed. On tap it was so much better. The bourbon added some nice sweetness to it.

I'm not so sure I'd say "Oh yeah!" to this with as much enthusiasm as that glass bastard. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and rather thick feel.

Aroma is the highlight, a potent complex blend of bourbon, caramel malt, mild citrus hops, oak, maple, berries, etc with surprisingly little booziness. Unfortunately the flavor isn't quite as complex and balanced at the nose; I guess this could use some more age on it. Flavor starts with an intense vanilla and bourbon booziness before the base of a more English style barleywine with complex caramel malts and dark fruity esters. Finish is exceptionally boozy and drying with light citric hops. Body is medium thick with light carbonation and overall has a smooth, soft texture that covers the palate with a lingering dry bourbon finish.

More of the same from the taste, except the hops come through to add a bitter element to the experience. There is also a nice caramel sweetness that accompanies everything. Mouthfeel is thick, and pretty boozy, but does not get in the way of drinkability too much. If you want a clear picture of this beer taste wise, it is very similar to the Lost Abbey Angel's Share Bourbon Barrel Aged beer, just a bit hotter and more bitter.

I think the barrel really takes the smell over. Taste is a wonderful intermingling between the natural flavors of the beer and the flavors imparted by the barrel. Charred oak, bourbon, sweet caramel malt, cherries, caramelized brown sugar, then dried dark fruits and a hoppy bitterness. The finish is sticky, warming a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft (that's the only thing I can think to call it), sticky, warming and comforting (an adjective that I think should be more widely used when describing beers like this).

The central waters barrel aged beers are so distinct in their barrel character.... not sure what kind of barrels they use though. Butterscotch and this charred/toasted wood character that is so distinct in the taste. Some sweeter vanilla and brown sugar combine with the robustness of the barrel notes. The base beer is not as complex as I remembered from the 2009 vintage, still boasts some darker fruity notes and toasted nuts for added depth. Upper medium bodied, low carbonation, felt a little 'heavy' at times. Alcohol becomes surprisingly evident as this got closer to room temp. Still, this was not too hot, but rather warming - making you constantly aware of the ABV.

Also picked up a little bit of oak. Moderate to full body with the perfect level of carbonation for the style, and just a little bit of alcohol heat.

Central Waters did not fail me on this one--I can now say that I absolutely love it. It's one to sip, but for the style (and what I'd guess the ABV to be) it's incredibly refreshing and drinkable. I enjoyed this one over a couple hours, but only through the sheer willpower of wanting to get a good review out of it and the selfishness of wanting to save it for as long as possible.

The taste starts with mildly sweet maltiness and roasty malts that then becomes wood and barrel like flavors before a formidable vanilla flavor takes hold.

I can definitely pick out some raisins and over-ripe fruits in this one, a nice kick of piney hops, loads of caramel. Very sweet and becomes even more so as it starts to warm. Bourbon wasn't very present, but the musty, wet oak barrel was. Carbonation is nearly absent, smooth, sippable, delicious. This one tastes pretty good but there's just a touch of oxidation in the nose and in the flavor.

Rich and syrupy feel, thankfully dry on the end like Y2K and not a sickly sweet aftertaste like so many barleywines.

A real treat from a small fantastic Wisconsin brewery that is really doing everything right when it comes to these barrell aged project beers.","francisweizen","Sep 07, 2008"

4.75,10.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy deep copper with a dense head that dissipated quickly to a ring foam leaving sporadic lacing. The first aroma is the big sweet caramel malt smell with raisins, dates and subtle earthy hops. This is followed by a big bourbon backbone along with some sweet vanilla beans. The taste actually has more bourbon than the smell with a more prominent molasses sweetness. The caramel malts and earthy hops are still there as well, but the bourbon really comes out in the taste with a serious alcohol burn. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy. The is a very good bourbon barleywine but the heavy bourbon presence means that getting through one of these would make for a good night. Update: I've had quite of few of these now. With 6-12 months on it, this beer is one of the best beers I've ever had. Fantastic.","gford217","May 29, 2008"

This is very good and the 11.2% ABV is certainly in your face. The malt tastes goes very well with the bourbon. This is worth buying. Very enjoyable! World Class!","ATLbeerDog","Apr 09, 2008"

4.67,8.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of bourbon-barreled Barleywines (especially hoppy ones like this), as I often find the barrel aging to be at odds with the hop profile, and the result ends up with a bunch of clashing colors. This achieves glory by compartmentalizing the barleywine and bourbon barrel traits up until the very end. And when they finally do converge, its absolutely harmonious. It's the best example of the style (specifically: booze barreled b'wines) that I've come across. And I can't think of another that even comes close.","cokes","Mar 09, 2008"
4.72,9.5,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This is a brew I'd love to have every day for the rest of my life. Great barrel aging art on this. Rich and creamy middle showing off caramel and toffee. Ripe dates and dried figs, alcohol, brown sugar, rum soaked raisin, thick tight vanilla and wood with a Jefferson's Reserve bourbon flavor. I have no clue what bourbon barrels they used or why I even said that. A showing of residual sugar towards the late middle ends in earthy hop bitter bliss balancing things impressively.","mcallister","Mar 09, 2008"

4.03,-6.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer took a lot of the same flavor cues from the non-bourbon ale. This adds a light whiskey element near the end. The aroma is pleasant, with the oak and vanilla, but still too weak. The drinkability was pretty good and unlike many other barleywines. Worth a try, very tasty.","tempest","Apr 09, 2007"
3.53,-18.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Label is the same as the regular Kosmyk Charlies Y2K Catastrophe Ale, but with a circle shaped green sticker on the right side of the label that states, "aged in bourbon barrels." Only available at the brewery. Ruby brown color. Fairly powerful nose, mainly dominated by the bourbon barrel (vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut.) Palate is okay, could be more textured and creamier. Flavor is good, but not sublime. Fairly well balanced, but the flavors dont come together very well. Ive had several better bourbon barrel aged barley wines.","Crosling","Mar 28, 2007"

4.37,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"A huge thanks to nflmvp for sending this rare barleywine my way. As soon as I uncapped the bottle, my nose was bombarded with tropical fruit aromas. It was then that I knew I was in for a real treat. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my snifter glass and allowed to warm up for 30 minutes. Served at 55°F. Appears a slightly cloudy, deep amber-red color with barely half an inch of tan head. The head fades rather quickly, leaving a thin ring around the inside of the glass and no lacing to speak of. Smells of tropical fruits (mainly pineapple), as well as toasted coconut, vanilla, bourbon, caramel malt, and oak. The bourbon really hits you upfront once you take a sip, as it should. This is followed by notes of pineapple, more bourbon, prunes, vanilla, and a nice peppery bite across the tongue. Great malt balance. The alcohol burn starts as soon as you take a sip and continues into the dry finish, although, it is always kept in check. Mouthfeel is a notch or two above medium in both body and carbonation. For me, this is certainly a sipper in order to take in all this beer has to give you. I'm glad I was able to try this rich and complex barleywine. I'd love to revisit it in a year or so to see how it's changed. If you have the chance, definitely give this one a try.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 18, 2007"
