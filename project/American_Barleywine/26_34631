Huge aromas of caramel and brown sugar soaked bourbon, with bits of dark fruit like cherries plums raisins and figs. The flavor is sweet but packs a lots of bourbon and alcohol to counter. Brown sugar and caramel with a solid bit of bourbon and hints of vanilla, oak, and dark fruits. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation, and a sweet almost syrupy sharp alcoholic mouthfeel. This beer smells fantastic, and tastes pretty good too, although at 12.5% it does have some rough alcohol edges. I enjoyed sipping on this for most of the night and wish I could spend more nights doing the same thing again.","johnnnniee","Mar 22, 2014"

The nose is huge, tons of bourbon, dark malts, caramel, brown sugar, dried figs. Taste is also huge, lots of malt sweetness, not really sugary. Tons of dark fruits with hints of apple, lots of brown sugar and caramel. Bourbon plays in nicely, less prevalent than the nose would have had me believe. Very full body, a hint sugary, soft palate but gets a touch grainy.","cpetrone84","Mar 20, 2014"

Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

4.09,-6,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Finding this was still on-tap was the major victory of the Three Floyds Brewpub Experience today. It pours a murky burnt sienna topped tonsure-style by a ring of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises bourbon, a healthy amount of maple syrup, vanilla, oak, molasses, and caramel. The taste does not deviate very far from this plan, though the maple syrup and molasses are decidedly diminished, and some light clove and nutmeg notes find their way into the mix. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda chewy feel. Overall, I was a bit disappointed that the base barleywine was so o'ershadowed by the barrel-aging, but the end product here remains pretty dern good regardless.","TMoney2591","Feb 05, 2011"
4.17,-4.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"As soon as I found this beer was still on tap I decided that it must be mine. This was served a murky looking brown with not much head on it, which may not be too appetizing until you realized it sat in an oak bourbon barrel for a long time. At that point it looks pretty tasty. The smell was unbelievably good. There was apparent the aromas most found in bourbon whiskey. There was hints of oak and vanilla along with the bourbon itself. The flavors while created on a backbone of heavy malts (the hops had long since died) was actually quite bourbon like in flavor. There was a twinge of the dank oak along with a peat smoked malt flavor that gave it a rather interesting harshness, that was by all means not bad. This beer had a hard time trying to figure out if it wanted to be a good whiskey or a barleywine. It was both and neither at the same time.","Vdubb86","Jan 30, 2011"

Aroma is out of this world. Lots of fruits. Ruby Red Grapefruit is the frontrunner with plenty of other aged citrusy fruits to back it up. The bourbon barrel just did absolute wonders for the taste and aroma. The barrel is a touch more present in the aroma but it's still perfect in the taste. Hops are still pretty big in the taste but nicely rounded out with the age. Sweet but not cloying. The alcohol is heavenly. The fruity esters are perfect. Body is about full with just enough carbonation. A pure sipper at its finest.","pwoods","Jan 25, 2009"

Still the citrus and bitterness of Behemoth, very "in-your-face" but included a sweetness/sugary taste of bourbon...easy to detect!

The flavor was almost that of melted caramel with tinges of bourbon seeping through. Very nice! The mouthfeel was lush and thick with minimal carbonation. Although my rating for this and the regular Behemoth are the same, these are two vastly different beers. Not anywhere near as hoppy as it is fresh, this brew has taken on a much sweeter, English barleywine character. I love it!","mdm46410","May 09, 2007"

If possible, I would give it a 6. Wish it had a bit of a bigger nose but oh well. Loved this so much more than the fresh Behemoth I had on tap and this experience inspired me to buy some Behemoth to cellar to see if the flavors will meld together as well in the bottle as they did after a year in the barrel.
