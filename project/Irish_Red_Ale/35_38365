The taste was mostly of malt with a slight hoppy bitter finish that lingered a bit. Medium bodied with good carbonation.

3.78,9.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 5/2014. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruit yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt forward profile and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Irish red ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2014"

The beer is silky and smooth going down and the roasted malts-taste mixes well with the overall flavor of the beer. The one disappointing part of the beer was its smell - not as good as I would have like, but easily overlooked with the rest of what this beer has to offer.","jjamadorphd","Feb 03, 2014"

The nose is faint but is of caramel and grainy notes. Flavor also seems a little muted, but definitely easy drinking. Mild caramel sweetness with a bready-toasted malt flavor, hops only to balance - finish is very neutral, somewhat dry and very satisfying. The mouthfeel is medium in body with a thick, creamy carbonation. Overall, I don't drink many amber ales any more but this one is a home run in my book - smooth and not too sweet this is one you could have more than a couple of.","gmfessen","Jun 14, 2013"

This Red pours a beautiful clear amber with not much head to talk about- nothing lasting, anyway. I get sweet candy and malts on the nose, with a touch of honey and caramel. There's nice carbonation. I taste the same, finished by lovely sweet candied honey hops. (Is there such a thing? Can I say this?) This beer has everything I'd expect from an Irish Red- nothing more, nothing less. It's hard to describe this beer above that. I don't understand the harsh reviews, as this is a very drinkable beer. I don't expect complexity or richness, and find myself pleasantly not disappointed. Boston can be proud of this Irish Red. Anyone that knows more about Irish Red's is welcome to introduce me to the "finer Red brews".","brewcifix","May 02, 2013"

Taste is much the same with malt and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip.

Some lacing is left behind on the glass during consumption. The beer smells of caramel and lightly toasted bread. There's also a mildy earthy smell. The taste follows the nose. There's bread crust and mild caramel sweetness balanced by the earthy hops. There's some back end hop bitterness that is fairly mild, but does provide some balance. There's almost a touch of smokiness in the flavor. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is fairly clean and the beer drinks smoothly.

Not a bad brew by any means and I'll definitely enjoy the last bottle of Irish Red that I have in the fridge. I wouldn't mind buying another, but maybe not a 6 pack.

Notes of banana and pear with a touch of grape and sweet alcohol. Taste is malty with the aforementioned flavors from the nose. Yeast is a signature here and this one leaves a nice mark on the ale. good fruitiness with a clean character. Finish is dry and also clean with a touch of malted grains.

Having said that, I did want for at least, say, a 10% increase in flavors, or at least enough that the sugars maintain their tastiness over several mouthfuls.

4.52,30.6,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a crimson red with an off-white to white head that laces pretty well and succumbs to a thin but relentless layer of head. The nose smells strongly of cherry and nutty malt sweetness; almost identical to an amaretto. Taste falls into the same description as the nose. Mouthfeel is bright and has a polished carbonation. Overall, this beer is dead on to the style and is as easily quaffed as it is dissected and relished. I'm thinking this and Guinness make for a nice staple of cases for my St. Patty's get togethers.","ClassicBrad","Jan 19, 2012"

Lots of rich malt aromas in the nose, with some light roasty/toasty highlights. Flavors are malty, but sharp, riding a highly carbonated body. Roasted and slightly smokey highlights keep the sweetness in check, and the beer has a somewhat sharp, burnt aftertaste, with a tangy, slightly sour malt overtone.

But this one has merit, too. Cracked open after a hot night at work, with a tombstone pizza in the oven, poured aggressively into my Samuel Smith pint glass and I must say, it's love at first sight. If I didn't know better, this one looks very much like the Boston Lager. But that's where the similarities end. Smell, I detect some caramel overtones and get flashbacks to a couple of my favorite Irish Reds in Short's Magician and Guinness's Smithwick's.

3.25,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a small one finger head that is already disappearing, maybe some decent laving. The head is slightly off white, a little unique of a off white really. The body is a dark red, white a big hint of brown, and maybe some hints of orange as well. I'm surprised at how cloudy this beer is, it's not dark enough to not be able to see through it, but it's cloudy enough so that I can't see through it at all. Very small amounts of carbonation from what I can tell. Overall it looks pretty good, but not great. Malt malt and more malt on the nose. Unfortunately it smells like some cheap malt, maybe Munich malt, the kind I'm not a fan of, or maybe just cheap malt, also it just smells way too sweet. Either way it doesn't smell that great, and not very complex at all. No hops on the smell whatsoever, and I would hope for at least a small hop bite in an irish red. This smells just a hair above average. Yeah the taste is just so boring, boring, BORING. I mean this might be the most un-complex beer I've ever had, is that the worst thing you can say about a beer? No, not at all, but it just means it's not going to stand out from the rest at all, and this one doesn't. Is it a bad beer? I don't think so, you can tell they used good ingredients, and they didn't skimp out too much on the beer, it's not very watery or anything, it's just super boring. There just isn't anything good to say about it, there isn't much bad to say about it, but still....it's just like I would feel completely indifferent drinking it, or not drinking it. It's not very refreshing at all, there is basically no hop bite, and the carbonation isn't very high. I guess in terms of mouthfeel it's ok, carbonation is decent and the body feels right in your mouth, it's just the boring taste. I'm trying to decide if I want to give this a 3 for taste or a 3.5 for taste, because I can tell it's made with good ingredients, and I usually give a 3 to a terrible micro brew or a really good adjunct lager, and this isn't a terrible micro brew, just really really boring. I guess what it comes down to is that I think it deserves a C+, not a B-, and I can only get that if I give it a 3, so even though I don't think it deserves a 3, since it's right on the cusp anyways, I'll bump it down for the sake of the overall grade. Drinkability is pretty bad, just because I have no real reason to drink it, I don't have a problem drinking it, but I have no reason to drink it, other than the fact that it's beer, I mean it's not even crisp. Overall, what else can I say, boring, boring, and more boring, pretty average beer.","MaltsOfGlory","May 12, 2011"
3.3,-4.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Not much of a head at all on the initial pour; after settling, there was just a thin layer of foam. Beer shows a very deep copper-red color appropriate to the style. Aroma is pleasing, showing nice hoppiness, but it is lacking the malty/caramel presence I would expect of the style. Malt is more in evidence upon tasting, along with some unexpected but welcome very subtle background notes of tart cherry. Despite this, I still feel the malt taste is still too restrained. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have preferred, but the carbonation is nice, tight, and refreshing. Overall, this beer as a whole is a bit greater than the sum of its parts. While it is lacking in a solid malt presence in the nose and on the palate, it is still tasty and refreshing.","bristol2120","May 10, 2011"

It's quite malty but it doesn't seem sweet. It's pretty resiny and there's a light herbal bitterness at the finish. It seems like a pretty solid session ale.

The taste amps things up a good deal, leaving me with notes of peppery toffee, toasted rye bread (plenty o' crust), and clove-y orange zest. I gotta say, I enjoy this stuff. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish.

It's a nice change from the "bigger is better" style that permeates the West Coast, (and which I LOVE), but I don't know that it's bombastic enough to stand out in a lineup. If I had 6 or 7 decent beers in a night, I would be afraid that the Irish Red would fade into the background.

The nose is very malty and smooth with caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar and ripe cherry, plum and apricot fruit scents, has some peat, tar and earth elements as well, light grass presence but hops not factoring in here. Full-bodied, well-carbonated and close to fluffy through the attack, immediately covers the mouth from cheek-to-cheek. Lays on that molasses, brown sugar, maple, caramel, however, a brush of pine, orange citrus, raw grains, and straw helps dry it out as it moves forward. Retains that mix of cherry, berry to peach, apricot fruit. One of those beers that's hard not to like when it's in your glass and going down the gullet but unlikely to make you want to pull the trigger on a future purchase.","farrago","Mar 21, 2011"

The taste starts slightly bitter, then the malt backbone kicks in for a sweeter middle. The finish is a lingering bittersweet flavor that fades into a dry aftertaste.

The aroma is not so special, but not bad, mostly caramel and honey with some pumpkin pie spice notes and a hop profile of wet leaves. The flavor is round and balanced, mostly toffee malt sweetness with a hint of pound cake, cola, and an unexpected berry fruitiness. Hops provide a firm, leafy spice that bitters the beer nicely.

It has floral notes on top of malt that isnt overpowered by the Golding hops... Aside from that, the beer is pretty average. Tastes more like a porter than an Irish red. Nice depth though, and I like how they approached this beer. Too much of this beer's flavor comes from the overpowering amount of darker malts used in this beer. However, it tastes too similar to their honey porter to be much in the way of an Irish Red ale. Its heavy, but drinkable, and it is like velvet going down, but where is my carbonation? This is an ale, not a porter, can someone please let them know that! It is part of the brewmaster collection, and rightfully so... but I really wanted an Irish Red when I bought this beer.","rodney45","Apr 07, 2009"

The smell was delicious - caramel malts, as advertised on the bottle. The first few sips were great - maybe some toasted malts, and there was a balance between the hops and malts, but then it all fell a part for some reason and the last 80% of this beer was just ok.

The beer is initially big with malt but not overpowering. It ends bitter, roasted and a touch dry. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is quite noticeable.

This beer is tricky. It is a lot like the infamous mullet hair style from the 80s. This beer is all business in the front and all party in the rear. The hops are heavily front-loaded. It is kinda hard to get used to. After the hops subside you get subtle maltiness and a refreshing finish that is heath-ledger-joker lipsmacking good. Well done Sam Adams.","pumarocks","Aug 21, 2008"

The deep red color is unusual for an Irish-style ale, having an almost burgundy hue. The rich sweet malty aroma is quite lovely, and leads well into the sweet caramel maltiness on the palate.

The smell was heavily sweet malt with caramel overtones. I almost found it to be too sweet - almost distracting - which had me worried about the taste being too sweet. It wasn't.

The nose is malty, expressing clean, medium-level caramel. Delicate, spicy and floral hops balance it. In the mouth it's medium bodied and creamy. The Samuel Adam's yeast character is present in the flavor. Otherwise it's just very basic and clean: straightforward caramel malts and lightly spicy/gently grassy/moderately floral hops backed by a firm bitterness. Very nice. Very drinkable. Superb balance.

Also a hint of alcohol and malt. Tasted slightly bitter and sweet at the same time. Perhaps the stronger alcohol content. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was just about right. I would be carefull making these an all nighter. The higher alcohol content was evident. I dont think this ale was as good as some of S.A. products.

I had this out of our refridgerator and not the beer cellar but still has good taste regardless of temp. It was very drinkable and would go with some roast and potatoes very well.

It may be a little off for the style, btu it's still darned tasty. This is very much an American interpretation of the style.

There are lots of caramel malts, some balance between dry and sweet grain, some bread like flavors, but pretty much the dryish unsweetened cherry fruits are pronounced in the background.

Smells of rich malts (caramel, roasted, toasted a little rum?), earthy ale hops, and a little honey? Appetizing. Tastes again of full malt flavors and English ale hops (Kent Goldings according to the label). A hint of spice? Nice example of the style, in my opinion. Medium to full-bodied, but the hops dry it out nicely. Another solid offering from BBC!

The head was nice, about a finger, but thinned quickly. Lacing was evident as there were some spots around the glass, just no distinctive rings. S: it was rather nice, it was a toasted, malty smell, and fuggle hops with a woody smell. It reminded me of the smell when walking into a brewery... the wart. I actually liked the smell.

The aroma is dominated by strong sweet malts, with a hint of hops. Sweet and simple. The taste is smooth sweet malts, creating a creamy nutty light caramel flavor. Medium smooth mouthfeel.

Turns out to be the former. The beer opens with a bright ruby color with hints of darkness (brown) with a terrific slight-of-tan head formation / retention and adequate carbonation. Aromas of rich malt, lightly toasted malts, nuts, and an ester that reminds me of timid berries. A fresh (wet-hop) aroma gives a distinct pungent / earthy / herbal, and at times piney character that later transfers directly to flavor. Along with the hops, the malts deliver a steady, medium malty flavor that hinges of fresh bread, yeast, and toast. A well attenuated, crisp cracker-like flavor provides a nice pillow for the piney hops and light esters. Kinda like the ale version of an Oktoberfest, but with increased maltiness. Finishes clean and with a mild, pleasant pine flavor. A very nice beer worthy of the Sam Adams branding.","BEERchitect","Feb 16, 2008"

The taste had a surprising citrusy, fruity sensation on the intake, moving to a cookielike buttery diacetyl presence, finishing with the mildest hoppy twinge and a long, lingering yeasty, bready flavor in the mouth. Mouthfeel was thinnner and weaker than I would have liked. Drinkability is decent -- a somewhat interesting beer that I wouldn't turn down but probably wouldn't select if it was sold on its own in a 6-pack either.","eberkman","Feb 04, 2008"
3.55,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Verdict: ok. Not too exciting, the signature yeast flavor is present but doesn't have enough supporting character to bring me back.","BretSikkink","Feb 03, 2008"

Although this is moderately sweet, there is a nice touch of bitter that does not fade from Irish Red. The carbonation is well-balanced. All-around good beer, not spectacular but very good, surprisingly so. I can't say that Irish Red Ale is atop my list of preferred styles, but this is highly drinkable, delicious, and enjoyable. Well done.","Gehrig","Feb 02, 2008"

Taste is very spicy malty, earthy, fruity, bitter finish and an ever so quaint touch of peat. Medium body, well carbonated, dry finish. Pretty drinkable. This one turned out better than I had expected it to be.","Doomcifer","Feb 01, 2008"

Smells fresh but that is about all I can gather (my nose is not very good). Taste is very robust and pleasing with malt up front and fruit/hop hint at end. I can take one sip and still taste it several minutes later which I find pleasant. This is a good beer that has a lot going on with lots of flavor. Unfortunately only two in the SA BM 12 pack so would definitely buy on its own if I run across sixer.","Kingdom4aPint","Feb 01, 2008"

3.63,4.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"An enjoyable beer. I figure it would be a great beer to introduce newbies. But like many other Sam Adams products, I think it lacks a distinctive punch, and its quality lies only slightly over the median.","jar2574","Jan 31, 2008"
3.19,-7.8,4.5,3,3,4,3,"Drinkability: I'd say it's OK. I wouldn't probably buy it by itself on purpose, especially the way Sam Adams is pricing their six packs these days.

This dissipated after a minute and left some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. I like the smell - there's some hop aroma, and a roasty malt scent. The taste is not quite as good as the look and smell, and leaves an aftertaste that is sticky. I think this would make a good dinner beer, paired with something meaty (and Irish, I suppose). It's not a session beer, at least not for me, but overall not a bad choice.","TravelingBeerMug","Jan 29, 2008"

Nice malty base with a hoppy finish with a caramel hint to it. This is a good irish red but it wasn't as hoppy as I would have hoped. Not a bad beer though, a nice take on this type of beer.

Slightly tan head is about 2/3 inch thick when poured. fairly quickly settles to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass with decent lace. Has a nice, rich caramel, and malty aroma. Also some fruit and tart smells here. The taste is slightly roasted malty and sweet upfront with flavors of caramel and tart. Also a bit of a bready/yeast flavor. Rounded out by some hop bitterness. Good malt and hop balance here. I just wish the flavors were a bit stronger overall though. Has a full bodied, crisp, smooth, and frothy mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Easy to drink. A good beer for sure, but SA could maybe have done a little better here.","neenerzig","Jan 24, 2008"

It's semi-sweet in the beginning and dry in the finish. It's incredibly balanced with a nice mild hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

Initial flavor is malty, caramel and bread, and citrus hops at the end to balance it out. Aftertaste is very mild citrus. Nearly no carbonation, light to medium body, no lacing. Drinkable as a nice alternative to a heavy beer, or one with more alcohol, or another SA selection.","joekfsu","Jan 18, 2008"

Typical reddish-copper body, but more than what I expected w/ a smell. Nostrils picked up a faint smell of citrus and bread, but also a nice smell of flowers and malt. The malts balanced nicely with the hops, creating a springy mouthfeel that is smooth, w/ a minor dry backbite but overall a creamy drink that is nicely flavored. I will definitely pick up a 6er of this and recommend the same to any fan of Irish Red Ales.","clayrock81","Jan 18, 2008"

It's a bit too much like or at least seems like a blend of some of their other beers at times, i.e. there's nothing terribly distinctive about it.

At the same time, it doesn't seem like you see much of this style around on the market, so so be it. Poured in to my Sam Adams pint glass a pretty copper color, with a medium sized white heading that eventually fades and leaves a ring around the glass. Smell is clean for the most part, with hints of cream and mint here and there. Taste starts off with a nice hop bite, followed by a decent amount of carbonation to back it up. In the middle, things get a bit creamier, then finally it ends on a buttery note. Mouthfeel is medium, and very drinkable....would make a proper session beer. Pretty impressive offering from Sam Adams right here. Reminds me a little bit of Humble Patience from Magic Hat, which was unfortunately retired some time ago.","jamie2dope","Jan 15, 2008"

Mouthfeel is medium with even carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is solid a steady sipping brew that I could imagine being pretty popular in the six pack format.

Not real set on the nose, but it wasn't terrible or anything like that. Definite malt taste, the caramel flavor shines. You can pick out the hops just a bit, and a little bitterness but it definitely doesn't finish off like a hopped beer "normally" would - if there's such a thing, that is. I think this beer would be great in the colder weather, as the drinkability round after round seems low.
