3.9,12.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 9/26/2014. Pours moderately hazy deep red/copper color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Irish red ale. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 31, 2014"

2.91,-15.9,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this beer. So far, pretty impressed with Shorts, this is another offering I have never had before. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn Tulip. This is an ugly looking beer. Looks like Storm drain water/something I would find in a rest stop toilet. Little to no head. Visible small bubbles streaming from the bottle of the glass. I assume this is going to be pretty carbonated. Smell- strawberries, a hint of plastic. Some off-flavors here on the nose. Taste- watered down plastic mixed with strawberries. Something is wrong here. I'm not sure I would call this a drain pour, because other than the plastic flavors, its a pretty easy drinking beer. There just aren't many redeemable qualities to this one. Overall, not a fan. Other offerings from Shorts have been very strong, this is an exception.","lnashsig","Nov 25, 2011"

There is nothing going on here really, weird flavours and only bready malt and very slight earthy hops come through at all.

Poured a murky red-brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no apparent lacing present throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and citrus hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruity hops, and a slightly sour note. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good Irish Red. The slightly sour note was very different than what I am used to, but I rather enjoyed it as I am a big Wild Ale fan too. With that said, this one is worth trying given the opportunity. Seeking out... Not so much.","thagr81us","Oct 13, 2010"

Malty aroma with hints of caramel and butterscotch (probably a touch of diacytl) with some herbal and floral hops. What I thought was diacytl in the aroma is much more noticeable in the flavor. A little too buttery. Otherwise has a nice caramel malt base with some mineral and earthy characteristics. Just a slight sour in the finish. The flavor is just a little rough around the edges. The body is light and nicely carbonated. Nothing really stood out. An interesting Irish Red that misses in a few areas.","morimech","Aug 19, 2010"

It has some nice toasted bread and toffee notes that combine with earthy herbal hops to create a classic aroma. The flavor is malt forward but with plenty brown sugar, toffee and toasted nutty character. Dry herbal hops are also present. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and the finish is equally thin, though fairly well balanced. The herbal hops really linger on the tongue, and I find myself wishing the malt was hanging around as well.

The beer smells spot on for the style, more malty than hoppy, toasty biscuit-like malts. Same with the taste, although something more than malts shows up in the aftertaste, a lightly sharp bitterness that must be hops-based. The beer is a little sweet up front but the aftertaste is bitter biscuit. Maybe my favorite from the style, it didn't convert me but it was still enjoyable.","TurdFurgison","Jul 23, 2010"

The body is light-medium-light and the carbonation is low. The alcohol is not evident. Delicate Belgian lace forms. It is very smooth, bright, and dry. Somewhat moreish.

Not really fruity, and no hop flavor or bitterness. Mostly cocoa. Moderately light carbonation and medium body make it easy to drink. A solid beer that is quite easy to drink.

Smooth and slick, it's an easy drinker, even if the flavors may be a bit of a challenge (or off-putting altogether) to some.
