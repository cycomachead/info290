4.01,13,4.25,3.75,4,4.5,4,"The body is medium, and this wouldn't work as well as a classic Irish style if it was much heavier. It's got lots of depth, but what really impresses me is a clean and robust balance against an incredibly silky smoothness that coats the tongue without slickness and flows like silk. Impressively, it doesn't give up crispness for all the smoothness.","Brenden","Apr 09, 2014"

I had it with some BBQ tempeh, mashed potatoes and broccoli, and it was the perfect pairing. This beer is proof that American brewers can do cool things with fairly standard styles without resorting to mondo hopping or zany flavors. Would drink again.","illpass78","Dec 23, 2013"

Smooth with a caramel/butterscotch taste, it was easy to put a few down quickly. I made a special trip to the brewery in Riverhead, where Greg showed me around and indicated that they were going to be bottling shortly from their Riverhead location. I can't wait, this Ale tastes great!","RMann","Aug 05, 2012"

3.55,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Had a sample from this brewery almost a year back and remembered enjoying it, so I took the opportunity to try it again when seen on tap. Close to a finger head on a caramel-reddish body. The smell is of caramel, butterscotch, with the taste leading there also with a tea-like flavor. The body is very light with light carbonation which makes the for a crisp refreshing character. A pleasant 'lighter' beer.","wcintula","Feb 05, 2011"
3.86,8.7,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Polishing off a 32oz. Growler at the 'mo. Reppin' Strong Island in a real good way with a decent appearance. This isthe second time I've had a growler fill of this brew and it's a solid sessionable brew. Definitely lighht carbonation and good mouthfeel throughout. Bold flavor with slight bitterness. Great with food.","iRoy","Nov 21, 2010"
3.53,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Poured a deep reddish color, bordering on brown. Little head, little lacing. Smelled no hops, muted malts. Tasted those malts, and maybe some caramel. Mouthfeel and drinkability are the best parts of this red ale for me. Smooth mouthfeel, slight carbonation, clean finish. Way drinkable at 5%. This is a very relaxed session-able brew.","gskitt","Oct 03, 2010"

3.95,11.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, I like it. Irish Red is a style that I feel is underrepresented and thought I'd give it a try when I caught it on tap. I'm glad I did. I would definitely give this a go and I'll be looking for their other beers in the future.","SkunkWorks","Jan 23, 2010"

3.63,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Picked up a growler direct from the contract brewer in Connecticut, this one shows a dark maple color with a fair off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma is pretty simple sour apple caramel malt, pretty sharp. Upon the first mouthful this is somewhat thin, an aqueous finely carbonated ale which somewhat resembles a sweet brown ale. I also pick up some smoke but the dominant taste is tart rhubarb and sour brown sugar. At first it seems too sour, almost like it's over "ripe" but as you get through the first pint, it mellows and the sweetness blends in a bit more and you get the nutty brown ale qualities, and always a touch of smoky wood. Drinkability is good, it grows on you. Worth a try.","Durge","0"
