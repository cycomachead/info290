3.54,2,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured from a nitro-can into a shaker pint, the beer has the cascade effect into a caramel coloring with a dense, smooth, cream colored head. Aromas of tangy cream, sugary and caramel sweet notes, and roasted notes. Flavors are roasted sweet forward, with caramel and nutty notes blending together, and some sugary highlights. Smooth and light in mouth, and the nitro really rounds out any edges. Tangy and sugary aftertaste, most noticeably caramel linger through the smooth, easy finish. Classic, and easy enough to drink, but there are better Cream Ales out there.","GarthDanielson","Mar 13, 2015"

This really is a lovely looking beer - I do love the cascading action as it assembles itself for consumption. The aroma is a faint bread and yeast, and the flavour is super soft on the palate. This is beer for people who don't really like beer, in many ways (my wife loves it). Overall, though, drinking a Kilkenny is a good thing.","Bunman3","Mar 10, 2015"

Its better than a lot of beers out there but if I had just had this one for the first time it would honestly get probably a 3.5 or 3.75, but I am biased based upon a youthful tromp through Europe when I drank this beer many years ago. It still good. If you can find it try it for yourself. I wish they would make it more readily available in this part of the USA, I would buy it more often for sure.","humuloner22","0"

The layered head is two-plus fingers with amazing retention and foamy presence yet there appears to be no carbonation. Feint odour of grain, yeast. There's just a hint of hops in the mouth, mildly bitter, rye bread with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is a bit sweet. Actually, it isn't anywhere rich as it looks and I think it drinks quite well for a cream ale. I wouldn't hesitate to try this on tap sometime.","ThatWineGuy","Oct 04, 2007"

Some rich roasted malt aroma is prevalent if you can get past that head that acts like a aroma seal. Some immediate tea-like bitterness followed by a sudden rush of roasted caramel malt which never overpowers the experience. The drying finish is there along with some hop bitterness. Altough somewhat creamy and very smooth, it was a tad on the watery side. Still very drinkable in large quantities by this reviewer.","Shadman","Sep 27, 2007"

Fair, it would take away from sales of the original, I'm sure. But this is s completely different style of beer. This is a Red-Cream Ale, with an enormous and beautiful head, and a smell of a heather field from the Emerald Isle herself. It has a full, rich body with malt to spare; and the finish goes on forever. I highly recommend this brew, and would consider trading to get my hands on more.","MattBrooks","Jul 11, 2005"

1.81,-47.8,3.5,2.5,1.5,2,1,"Bleech. I've never been a big fan of Kilkenny, but I hadn't tried one in several years and thought it was worth another shot. Especially since it's my brother-in-law's favourite beer. Bought a 4 pack and split it with him. Both of these wound up going down the drain. I can't get this pine taste out of my mouth. I feel like I've been sucking on a branch of a Christmas tree. I don't know if it's psychological, but I don't think I've had a nitro can yet that I enjoyed. Shouldn't be the nitro that puts me off, but whatever, yuck. It'll be several years before I have one of these again... unless it's on tap, that might make a difference, but I doubt it.","Noxious26","Jun 25, 2005"
3.03,-12.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Red in colour with your typical nitro qualities of a lasting head and thick mouthfeel. There are some candy-sweet malty aromas from this one, a slight mineral note, and a somewhat strange veggie smell as well. The flavors are dominated by a slightly sweet malt component, along with some iron-like well water flavors. Overall, it's an ok session beer, but nothing special.","fisherman34","Jun 05, 2005"
3.54,2,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"On-tap, served in the proper labelled glass. A nice looking inch of off white head of creamy thick bubbles. Bright , clear pale amber body. The head lasts the whole way down, with full coating of lace on the glass. Nitro kills alot of the aroma, buyt there is some caramel comining through. Full flavored with toasted caramel malt balanced by some hop bite in the end. Nice creamy thick mouthfeel and it goes down smooth. Better on tap than from the nitro-can.","BigBry","May 26, 2005"
3.88,11.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark red color, almost brown. Smell is strong like a traditional lager, almost like Stella. The taste is like a lager as well, although there are many more hops added to it. Its almost thick going down, no doubt due to the nitrous. There is lots of overall flavor, and its very multi-faceted but its heavy in consistency.","Toddv29424","Apr 30, 2005"

2.87,-17.3,4,2,2.5,3.5,4,"Looks good out of the can - dark amber with strong lacing and head retention a little too good, and artificial-looking. Smell - chemical, aluminium can, some hop scent but not nice. Taste - I'm ambivalent. I think the real flavour that goes with this beer is the ashen smell and taste of old men in a small smoky Irish pub. Somewhat lacking when the surroundings aren't right. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, a little harsh from carbonation. So easy to drink that you could enjoy it anywhere out of the way when you felt like a few pints. Costs too much for what it is, but it's better than a lot of shit they try and serve us.","Weizenmensch","Mar 07, 2005"

3.46,-0.3,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Deep coppery brown with a dense, cream coloured head. Plenty of lace down the glass. The aroma was very mild, with some floral hops and light toasted malts. It had a light biscuit or toasted malt flavour with a mild bitterness that lingers through the finish. Fairly smooth, partially due to the light carbonation, and it had a light body. Dry finish, partially due to a light grain astringency.","DrJay","May 07, 2004"

Aroma is very light with some small notes of malts. I founded the taste to be very creamy with some small notes of roastiness and sweetness. This beer was a bit dry at the end with a small watery aftertaste but again subtler then Guinness. Overall, this is a very enjoyable session beer from a decent brewery.","Phyl21ca","Mar 13, 2004"
2.55,-26.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,2,"I do not really know cream ales enough to judge this one on another basis, but it was certainly not my favourite. The pour, brown with a head and sinking bubble appearance like a stout, immediately releases a considerable malt aroma that describes most of what the beer is- extremely sweet on a full body with no carbonation, and just a slight bitterness at the end, which doesn't match with the rest properly.","Andreji","Feb 25, 2004"

Smelled of hops, and malt. When tasting, all i can remember is tasting what i thought was tin, not very impressed. For the available cream ales we have here, i reccomend Tetley's anyday.

Aroma is primarily of sweet caramel malt. Taste directly matches this, with a small touch of hops on the finish. Nice thick mouthfeel and it goes down velvety smooth. Nothing exceptional about this ale, it's actually pretty plain and average and very straight forward, but it makes for a good session beer, and it sure looks pretty.","IronDjinn","Aug 12, 2003"

The color is a reddish amber, and the nose reveals very little about this one. It goes down easy enough, but the hops and/or malts just aren't prominent enough for me. I was expecting alot more judging by the looks. Ah, well - at least at this pub they also had Murphy's, which is a far better alternative for me! :)","steelreign","Mar 21, 2003"

This is a nitro can exported to Canada with 4.3% abv. It pours a deep copper with an orange/reddish cast. The off-white nitro head is exceptionally creamy and maintains a solid 1/4" cap throughout the pint (well, 14+ ounces anyway). It leaves some nice lace and gives the impression of "a proper pint". Within the nose a softly sweet and gently buttery caramel malt darts in and out through mildly earthy/mineral Fuggles hops. The body is light but creamy; and accentuates the balanced toasty, caramelish, and lightly fruity malt. It finishes dry and biscuity with a lingering note of dull buttery caramel. It's very easy to drink with a decent amount of character. A nice session beer! Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 24, 2003"

The deep red colour and cascading carbonation of a freshly poured pint are prime examples of the style.  The taste is near heavenly; smooth and well heeled, without significant bitterness.  Kilkenny is truly drinkable, I could drink this daily for the rest of my life and be a happy man.  I feel sorry for Americans, since you apparently can't find Kilkenny in the States.  My favourite beer, hands down.","the42ndtourist","Beers"
