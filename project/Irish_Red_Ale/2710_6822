Smell is of malt and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp on the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good red ale but like the Nutty Brewnette the alcohol on the finish is slightly jarring.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 10, 2012"

3.83,4.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a reddish-brown with a small, off-white head that left some patchy lacing. Basic aroma of sweet malts, caramel; toasty. Same in the taste, with nice caramel malt sweetness, mild hop bitterness, and just a hint of the above-average alcohol content. A little chewy with a slightly off aftertaste, but nothing intolerable.

4.42,20.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this beer las night as a part of their 8 beer sampler. Overall, I have to say that the Jeremiah Red was my favourite. It had a deep reddish amber colour, which immediately caught my eye. There was a bit of head but not much lacing. The smell was wonderful with a slightly fruity aroma at first, followed by some malt notes and the slightest bit of hops. The taste was quite bold with rich caramel and toffe malt flavours paired with the slightest bit of hoppiness, which was riminiscent of the aroma. A slight bit of fruitiness but almost no alcohol except for a slight tingling. The alcohol was very well hidden for the reported ABV. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Overall the beer was well balanced and my favourite of the BJ's brews. Definitely getting a pint next time I drop by for a meal.","am7cxr","Nov 24, 2010"

3.71,1.1,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice reddish amber color with a slight off white head which is about one finger in size and gives way to web lacing down the glass. The aroma is of caramel malt backbone with some roasted malt and hint of ever so slightly of hops. The taste has a caramel malt backbone along with a touch of roasted malt. In the middle there is a hop bitterness of wet hops and earthy hops as well as some dark fruit. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall this is a nice beer, it is an easy drink, its not as complex in the nose as i would like but the rest of the beer is good. It has a nice balance.","goblue3509","Dec 28, 2009"

I smell roasted malts with a hint of smokiness. I am drinking this growler two days after purchase but it has held its carbonation very well. It is malty in taste and goes down pretty well. BJ's is not my favorite brewpub but the old lady likes the food, as do I, so I will continue to go there. Hey, it's better than drinking Miller Lite at a chain restaurant.","buschbeer","Jun 03, 2009"
3.48,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: decent beer, not at all what I was expecting. I simply went off of the Red Ale name without reading anything about. expecting an Irish Red, I got a bit of shock upon first taste but when I corrected the style in my head it allowed me to see it was a good beer.","LyonsHead","Apr 13, 2009"
3.88,5.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Srong toffee malts combine well with sunkist barley notes for bright caramel tastes and a depth of kilned barley variations. Dark copper-mohogany in color, this beer releases a thick, dense, barley-stained head that lasts the session and laces very well. The malts dominate the beer throughout, however there's a fresh hop flavor (piney and grassy) that only shows up in the taste, everso lightly in the nose, and struggles for balance in the mouthfeel. Alcohol content is evident with a sharp prickle to the mouth and light numbing. Confectionate sweetness accompany the barley notes from nose to finish, while always edging out the hops. Finishes with that cotton-candy sweetness and alcoholic numbness. Yes, bold for a Red which hurts drinkability but I like it for a variation.","BEERchitect","Apr 02, 2009"
3.95,7.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Probably the best Irish Red I have had. I am not surprised it has received medals. The appearance of this is beer is a light coppery color. Moderate lacing on the glass as it was consumed. The nose is excellent, a malty and ever so slight citrus hint at the end. It has a wonderful light malty flavor with a good hop balance. I had to go for two of these. It packs a heavier punch than most Irish Style Reds at 7.4% ABV. Without a doubt the best of the year-round beers that BJ's has to offer.","TheEclecticGent","Dec 11, 2008"

3.73,1.6,3.5,3,4,4,4,"The pour is an amber color with a reddish hue. The nose faint and hard to describe. The taste has a very complex malt character.

3.17,-13.6,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pretty much like most reds except with a little more punch to it. The bitterness, as with most BJ's brews, comes on strong at the end. It was not as smooth as I would have hoped.","nem2006","Aug 14, 2005"
3.68,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A pleasant lunch at BJ's. This was a dark amber color, with a medium head and some nice lacing. It had a mildly fruity aroma. The taste was a little more malt than fruit, but still was a nicely balanced beer. I think this was a very drinkable beer, and probably would have enjoyed this a little more if it was the only style I drank at lunch.","lordofthewiens","Mar 16, 2005"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"On tap at BJ's in Cupertino. Pours a clear reddish brown body, with a white head, good retention. Sweet malt in the nose and some fruitiness. Taste is sweet, malty, caramel and a bit nutty. This is no Arrogant bastard, but it still hit the spot. Finish is dry, and grainy. Good amount of hops for the style. Good drinkability for its ABV.","baiser","Mar 13, 2005"

Jeremiah Red is a deep red-amber in color with a small head. Smell is light and somewhat fruity. The taste is very nicely balanced with fruity notes. The finish is a little bit more malty.

4.18,13.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this one on tap and then I got a growler to come home with me. It poured with a huge off white head that lasted for a good 5 minutes before it settled into a nice lace. There was not much smell at all comming off this brew other than malt, and once I started drinking I found out why. The beer was allmost all malt with very little hop bitterness and spice but it seemed to work out just fine. Everything mixed together wonderfully and I really enjoyed the taste of this brew. Like I said, I brought a growler home and most of my friends who are not into the stuff I get really liked it...so this may be a good cross-over brew!","Dmann","Jul 30, 2003"

4.19,14.2,3,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This particularly sampling of Red was from the cask with a large dose of East Kent Goldings to pick up the nose. Normally a bright deep ruby color, the cask version of the beer was a hazy brown with virtually no head on the pour. The EKG's were prominent as intense floral notes in the aroma while they lent the palate a lingering grassiness. The beer's flavor is a crystal malt chewy extravaganza cut by a strong tingling sensation of alcohol and american bittering hops.","drewbage","Apr 05, 2003"
3.85,4.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer arrived a very dark amber color with a decent tan head. There was a roastiness in the aroma that I wasn't expecting of an amber ale.
