3.58,2.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is malts, caramel, some grains, smooth and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a fine session or warm weather beer.","tone77","Mar 22, 2014"
3.55,2,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, toast, and nut aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet toast, earth, and nut flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid toast and nut qualities all around.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 21, 2014"

The flavor profile is driven by taste of amber malt and includes a trace of sweetness. There is also a hint of cloves in the flavor.
