Has the classic "Guinness" style foam head that's a a good finger thick and appear to be staying for the duration. Creamy malt spice aroma. Low carbonation. Crisp light sweet malt taste. Smooth velvet mouth feel with a faint feel of carbonation on the tongue. Refreshing and wanting more already.","rjplumer","Feb 12, 2015"

3.75,9.3,,,,,,"Poured an amber body with a nitro cascade that settled into a clear amber body with one finger of thick, creamy head. A very good looking pub ale, quite appealing. Scents of caramel, low toffee character and very light toasted malt and grassy hop aromas. Overall impression of aroma is of a clean, malty ale, true to style and pleasing. Flavor begins moderately sweet with notes of caramel and toast. Middle is medium dry, moving into flavors of lightly toasted bread and light toffee. Finish is medium-dry with a light roasted malt flavor, toffee, and toast. Aftertaste is lightly roasted malt and toasted, nutty malt. Overall impression is of a malt-forward ale that begins modestly sweet and finishes nicely dry. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with medium body and light carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good Irish Red Ale, very pleasing. Overall this is a nice Irish Red. It has a true to style aroma and flavor with a creamy good mouthfeel. A good, simple pub ale.","Auraan","Dec 03, 2014"

The aroma brings some sweet malt, lightly fruity, grain notes. Similar flavor. The nitro-tap really does wonders for beers of this ilk. Smooth and creamy. Easy to drink. No harsh flavors detectable. Simple and easy going. Nothing to wrote home about, but this is a solid beer to find when I thought perhaps there may be no decent beer options.","Huhzubendah","May 23, 2014"

3.21,-6.4,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Arrived in an official Kilkenny pint glass, deep reddish-brown with around two fingers of light tan foam. Kilkenny smells like faint caramel, with fruity notes and hints of floral hops. As is often the case, this example was served too cold but unfortunately the aroma remained subdued even after things warmed up. Taste is that of a classic mass-produced Irish red, with caramel/toffee the predominant malt flavor along with a little roasted barley and some red grape fruitiness. Body is rather thin and the beer comes off watery and on the bland side, but there is a tea-like tannic astringency that I like in this style and some earthy hops in what is a decent bitter finish. A bit of cardboard and metal make an unwelcome appearance but all in all I'd drink this before many other macro-brewed UK offerings. Its designed with "drinkability" in mind: Smooth creamy mouthfeel and few overtly loud or bombastic flavor elements to dissuade the average pubhound.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 05, 2013"

The taste was very good and the creamy head (which never dissipated) gave a sweet taste to counteract any bitterness. My first impression that it would be extremely heavy which at the time would be bad because I was about to enjoy a nice Irish meal, but the beer was much lighter than expected. If I could find this stuff in the US, I'd be getting some for the holidays!","SDVargo","Oct 24, 2013"

This stuff pours a lightly hazy bronze topped by a nice finger of cream foam. The nose comprises light sweet malt and even lighter powdered sugar. I think some light sweet flowers may have wafted in there from time to time as well, but I could have been imagining things. The taste brings in more of the same, flowers and all, only stronger and with an addition of mild caramel and even milder grass. Th body is a light medium, with a firm nitrogenation and a subsequently silky-smooth feel. Overall, this stuff wasn't bad at all. I could easily see myself downing pints of this as a Guinness replacement at Irish-style pubs around here (if they carried it...).","TMoney2591","Oct 06, 2012"

Little to no carb from the base of the beer, but my goodness every sip captures some of the huge head on top and it is like a nice iced coffee that has been frothed. Overall, a nice cream ale.

This covered a nice amber red body that is how it was supposed to look. The aroma was rather bland in nature there was a bit of hop and green apple. The flavor consisted mostly of malted barley and green apple. The green apple almost made me think I had mistakenly ordered a cider, but this was not true. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The flavor however was muddled greatly due to the nitro tap. I'm not sure how good it was supposed to be but the kind I had was extraordinarily water. This is the worst mouthfeel I've ever given a nitro-tap. It was drinkable no real problems taking it down, but It's not really the best beer I've had from Guinness, but it held it's own, and was definitely an interesting experience.","Vdubb86","Oct 28, 2010"

Nose had a lightly malty sweetness which was okay with me. Mouthfeel was creamy, which is as it should be with this serving style. The taste was pleasantly mildly bitter with a hint of nuttiness on the tongue. Finish was slightly dry, pleasant, easily quaffable. This was a nice, simple beer, somewhat unobtrusive, but with such low alcohol that I could easily see having it in my cooler for a day out.","woodychandler","Oct 12, 2010"

3.41,-0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed from my notes. Served with my Irish Breakfast on St. Patrick's Day. It has a rising foam head, like a Guinness. It's a think, white cream foam about 1 finger in height. The body is clear and colored dark copper. There aroma isn't very strong, just a whiff of grain and slight glassy hops. It has an all-malt flavor. There is a hint of caramel, but nothing spectacular. There is a dry, toasted grain finish. It has a medium body. There isn't much carbonation in the beer, but the foam head is nice and creamy. It has a normal amount of coating. It's very drinkable. It doesn't have the best taste, but it certainly goes down easily. You could drink this one all day, if you weren't looking for a beer to focus on (i.e. it beats the bland, mass-produced domestics, but doesn't compare with many craft beers).","ToasterChef","Mar 15, 2010"
2.4,-30,4.5,2,2,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability: Instantly forgettable. My goodness, was that ever a whole bunch of nothing, lacking entirely in the departments of aroma and flavor. Sure, it's smooth and easy-drinking, but if it isn't going to taste like anything, what's the point?","ChainGangGuy","Mar 09, 2010"

3.72,8.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D - This is a fine anytime macro-beer. This is what large wealthy beer companies should try to make. Easy to drink. Non-offensive to beer novices and snobs alike. Very sellable.","jeranbrews","0"
3.58,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"On nitro tap at the Lansdowne Pub near Fenway. Not on the menu, but I saw the tap handle behind the bar. Served in a Kilkenny glass, which is another thing I like about this pub (unrelated). Super dark red color, almost brown. Nice thick and rich creamy head on top. Had a bit of a malty and floral smell. Taste was not overwhelming, but just good enough. Hints of roasted barley here and there on the palate. I don't normally order Irish Red style beers, but I certainly will again if it's on nitro. It really adds a nice layer of texture to the beer that I enjoy. The low abv made this beer an easy drinker. While not the most flavorful beer, it was a nice pairing to my bangers and mash dinner.","morebeergood","Jan 30, 2010"
4.46,30,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"pours a dark amber colour with a beautiful thick creamy head. Attractive aroma. tastes dry with hints of caramel and malt also packed with plenty of hops. this beer goes down extremely smoothly and is highly enjoyable to drink. all in all its a great beer and one of favourites that i'd highly recommend.","kilks","Jan 26, 2010"
3.38,-1.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Goes down, almost to easy. You could call this a "beginners-ale" - many of the greatness from ales are present, but very mildly.","Evil_Pidde","Jan 20, 2010"
3.06,-10.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Poured a deep reddish color with excellent carbonation and a nice creamy white head. Nose is dry, caramel malt, but thats about it. Taste is grains, caramel and dry but creamy.
