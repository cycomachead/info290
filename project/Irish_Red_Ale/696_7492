3.08,-14.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"12oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brown with red hues. Not much head. Almost no lacing. Aroma is slightly boozey with some bread, malt, and maybe some hints of chocolate. Taste is somewhat sour with some earthy and malt flavor. Some caramel as well. Tangy, sour finish. Light body and carbonation. Not sure how I feel about this one. The sourness is a bit much for me. Not a bad beer but not a great one either. Overall, it works alright in the mix 12 pack but I wouldn't ever seek it out.","PicoPapa","Jul 23, 2011"
3.85,7.2,4.5,4.5,3,4,4.5,"Pours a clear dark garnet red body under a beige one finger fizzy and foamy head. Lots of visible carbonation. Nose is slightly sweet toasted and crystal malts with some light hoppiness. Flavor is dry toasted and lightly crackery malt with just a hint of bitterness on the finish. A lingering huskiness remains. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, just shy of creamy in texture were it not for the prickly nature of the carbonation. Overall, just about what you’d expect from an Irish Red. Quite full of flavor, but not in your face.","KrautAficionado","Jul 17, 2011"

The head dissipates to a few clingy spots on the edges. Smells of sweet Carmel with a hint of grassy earthiness. Tastes initially sweet and Carmel which transitions to a clean slightly bitter finish. This is an easy drinker and think a BMC person could get into this one quite easily. Not a wow beer but not bad either.","Homebrew35","Oct 07, 2010"
3.15,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Sour malt flavor that is almost as if a malt vinegar was added. Light hop that shows up in the swallow and aftertaste can't save this one. The mouthfeel is thin.","smcolw","Sep 12, 2010"
3.9,8.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a dark reddish brown with minimal cap of off white head, decent lacing. Scent brings sweet notes of brown sugar, burnt carmel and some grassy and roast qualities. First taste brings the brown sugar and dark carmel sweetness with a roasted nut quality. Grassy flavors as well as some earthy and smoke. Fuller side of medium bodied, slick and coating, perfect like carbonation. A nice Irish red which contains some bold flavors without being overly sweet.","rfgetz","Sep 06, 2010"

It pours a clear ruby amber topped by about a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, rye bread, maple syrup, and brown sugar. The taste follows, emphasizing the sweeter notes, like maple syrup, brown sugar, and plenty o' toffee. A slightly sharp bit o' sourdough creeps in there near the end as well, and this somehow does not detract. The body is a nice medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, not a bad red at all, nice and straightforward.","TMoney2591","Jul 07, 2010"

3.33,-7.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a deep red, near-brown, into an American pint glass, with less than a finger of head, spotty lacing, and mild carbonation. The smell was dominated by malt, with a little bit of caramel. The taste was a little more balanced between malt, caramel, and toffee, but still fairly one-dimensional. The mouthfeel was medium, with less carbonation then expected. Sessionable? Yes, if you love malty flavor in excess, but this beer was too one-dimensional for me.","donniecuffs","Dec 14, 2009"

Nose is very malt forward, lots of nutty and tofee notes...a bit of vanilla and molasses. Some dark fruit. Sweet, earthy, nutty malts with good caramel backbone. A bit of sharp hops tries to balance the swetness, but it doesn't work. A bit too sweet but the flavours are good for the most part. Creamy, and overall pretty good.","mrmanning","Aug 03, 2009"

3.65,1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a light to medium bodied beer that is very easy to drink. Complex it is not. The beer is not nearly as sweet as the nose would have it. There are plenty of roasted grains, a slightly charred maltiness that interacts with the drying hop to take away the beer's sweetness. The slightly ashy flavor is the predominant flavor throughout. There is a cherried, maybe a slightly honeyed crystal malt flavor underneath, but it can't get out from underneath the charred and ashy flavors. The beer is modestly carbonated, reasonably refreshing, has a touch of an oiliness in the mouthfeel, and the aftertaste is the same charred notes found in the body of the beer. It's a decent beer, but nothing worth going out of the way for.","albern","May 10, 2009"

3.85,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a amberish gold, a nice size head with sticky lacing and good retention. Smells like a boquet of fruity aroma, with tinges of toffee and honey. Taste is a big caramel malt profile up front, with a nice bitterness in the finish. Some malt spice is present on the finish.

Tastes of of sweet malts up front then falls off to a very thin finish with a small herbal hop bite, but nothing significant.

The smell was malty, some biscuit and a little bit of roasted malt. The flavor followed through with the malts, I didn't get much from the hops except maybe a little tempering of the sweetness. I've never counted Irish Reds among my favorites, but this one could enter the upper echelon within that style.","TurdFurgison","Nov 05, 2008"
3.18,-11.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Nothing too special here in my opinion. A huge malt bomb for me, almost no detectable hops at all.

3.98,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear darker amber ruby. Nose is metallic and kind of nut-like. Flavor is deep and consistent. Carries a real earthy and slightly leafy character. On the end there is a sweet tone with a touch of light caramel to it. Feel is kind of sticky on the liquid and the bubble is low on the mouth. Overall very drinkable. Smooth and even and a good one to enjoy.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"

Nice palate and great feel. This was defiantly a winner and I am sure it really shines when on tap. This one is recommended.","mikesgroove","Nov 27, 2007"
4.01,11.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"M/D - A fair amount of carbonation but no at all displeasing. I haven't tried many Irish Red Ale's but I can tell I will like the style. The sweetness and the balance really stand out to me and really enjoyed the first one and wish I had another. I highly recommend this beer.","Gatch","Nov 11, 2007"
3.33,-7.2,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This brew is copper red with a light head but fair lacing. Not much to smell other than a hint of skunkiness. Tastes of wheat and a very mellow malt blended in nicely. It's mild with OK carbonation, quite drinkable. There is a peppery touch with a light apple background. A nice tasting red, very passable for a wide variety of occasions. Drink responsibly.","Durge","Aug 31, 2007"
3.72,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass a deep mahogany color with a very thin cream colored head. Slight carbonation. The aroma had some floral notes and a lot of malt.

3.97,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"It has a full malt flavor, but the richness of the mouth presence seems to dominate the experience. I'm not finding the combination as distracting as some. I would enjoy this one as a session beer if it was available locally.","jjayjaye","Jun 28, 2007"
3.98,10.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, bisquit, and special roast malts. It's sweet with caramel malts, yet dry with a toasted aroma. The taste is good also. It has a crisp, dry malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a bit of hops and a slight bisquity edge. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. Something with this much malt character shouldn't be this carbonated. This is a damn good red ale. It's got excellent aroma and malt flavor. One of the best red ales I've ever had.","WesWes","Jun 24, 2007"
3.6,0.3,4,4,3,4,4,"It's got a nice mouthfeel and fine drinkability, but it's not one that will lodge in my memory. Probably great for a party where people are just tipping back the brown bottles, but nothing to boast about.","gueuzeonhigh","Jun 08, 2007"
3.51,-2.2,4,3,4,2.5,3.5,"This is a rich, full-flavored red-ale, but it's a bit thick and tough to drink. It drinks like a stout, or something bigger than this actually is. Don't get me wrong, there's a nice caramel malt flavor with a splash of citrus hops, but it's too much IMO for a red ale. I like the flavor and complexity, but dial back the mouthfeel.","tempest","Mar 23, 2007"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep garnet with a nice head that fades to a ring. Nice tang of malt in the aroma with a hit of spicy hops at the end and an underlying yeastiness. The first time I had this beer I was struck by its maltiness, but now that I review it, I detect more hops and more of a balance. Still tangy malt upfront, but medium bitter hops throughout. Fruity, maybe faint red fruit flavors, but dry. Fairly light, but clean and delicious, and enough malt to give it some body. Holds your interest.","Georgiabeer","Mar 23, 2007"

The smell is all malts, caramel and toasted maltiness very little hop character. The taste is much like the smell , dominated by a full malty taste with a bit sweet but not overly sweet and again just a touch of hops. There is a touch of a metallic flavor as well but the finish is nice. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my taste maybe slightly overcarbonated as well. The drinkability is ok this a decent irish red and is a lot better than some other irish reds that i've had.","fank2788","Mar 08, 2007"

3.53,-1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep ruby red hue with smallish tighty bubbled head that is the color of almonds. The aroma is faintly of hops, citrusy, American, and slightly grassy. This is an Irish red but there is minimal malt aroma, and is a clearly Americanized interpretation. Taste is tea like and yes biscuity but very fleeting...theres a faint dark malt note but that all fades quickly into hops, pine, citrus zest hops and that lingers. Gentle, muted malt flavors here. Session kind of beer here, But not a remarkable one. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and fully carbonated, thought fine for style, its not helping. A session beer for certain, or an American, hop-focused Smitwicks for those who prefer hops to malt. Doesn't this contradict the style thought, basically? It's half Irish red half American amber. It probably gets high ratings as it leans toward hoppy rather than malty despite that not being part of the traditional style, so it gets better ratings here than say, Hibernian which is American but true to style. I prefer other versions, but this is not a bad brew, thought not a very special one, either.","Liquids","Sep 05, 2006"
4.11,14.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"From a 16 ounce swing-top bottle, this pours very dark for an Irish red, with subdued, dark ruby highlights and a thick head that leaves a very substantial ring around the beer. The nose is all carapils malt, with slight, dusty hops underneath. On the tongue, those sweet caramel malts come through first, then metallic, moderately bitter hops that mesh together and balance each other rather well. Medium bodied, with good carbonation at the mid palate and a flat finish. Overall, a great session beer that I could drink all night. Smooth and interesting enough, and perfect adherence to style.","geexploitation","Sep 03, 2006"

3.31,-7.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"D: Mild seems to be the keyword that comes to mind the most when thinking about this beer. Perhaps it's because I've been drinking intensely hoppy or malty brews this winter and this was a sudden departure from those styles.

I enjoy the deep malty notes that remind me of rich brown bread. Tastewise the beer delivers mostly malt up front, and some low, but mouthwatering hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium, with appropriate carbonation. Very well balanced brew, and another winner from this brewery.","PatandDavid","Apr 13, 2005"
3.43,-4.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer poured a dark red with a thick head. That receded to form a slight film on top of the beer. The aroma was all malts and grassy hops. The flavor was sweet malts and reminded me of the the sugar toasted peanuts I used to eat in NYC. There was also a nice grassy hop kick to the back end of the flavor. the beer has a full body.
