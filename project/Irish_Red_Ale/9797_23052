Rich sweet caramel maltiness with earthy and bits of oxidation obviously present. Medium to thin body moderate carbonation.

This is not one of my favorite styles, as it is not overly-complex in flavor or aromas, but this is a sturdy version of the Irish Red Ale. I'd prefer this over the commercially available imports (ie Murphys, Smithwicks) any day. The dry finish is a desirable effect.","KevBot89","Apr 08, 2014"

1.62,-52.1,3,1,1.5,2,2,"Had the cask version of this beer at Pipers Pub in Pittsburgh. I'm used to having a nice creamy head from a beer drawn from a hand pump, but this one had none at all. Very low carbonation. The nose was literally non-existant - similar to smelling a glass of water. Very strange. The flavor followed suit with not much of anything going on. Very thin in body - not much in the way of a discernable malt pallete, and only a hint of hops in the tail end of the finish. To sum this beer up in one word - Bland. I was excited to try this beer being that it is local, but ended up completely dissapointed, and $5 poorer. Not a great introduction to North Country Brewing.","ChuckVee","Jul 31, 2009"
4.53,34,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Came to the table a wonderful deep, blood-ruby red with a nice bit of thick foam and had very nice lacing throughout. Very nice thick malty scent, deep and slightly woodsy. Excellent taste, a very nice maltiness, just south of a brown ale, with a touch of tartness to it and a nice light hoppy finish; unlike a lot of red ales, they did not overhop this one, it was just about perfect. Went down wonderfully smooth, although I know part of that is because it was through a cask ale system. I'd like to compare to a non-cask version, but definitely recommend it on cask.","JamesS","Dec 08, 2008"
3.32,-1.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a dark red to slightly orange color with little to no head. The smell is of caramel malts with some slight smell of citrus hops. The taste is very similar, it has a slight caramel malt taste that is slightly sweet and is balanced out with some citrus hops. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, not much going on for the mouthfeel. The drinkability is good, it is a serviceable beer that you could have a couple of, but not go all night.","goblue3509","Aug 30, 2008"
