Fruity aroma has notes of banana, pear and tangerine plus a subtle malty tone. Rich & fruity flavor delights the taste buds with banana and pear notes plus hints of tangerine and butterscotch. Texture has firm body and plenty of fizz. Waltz with this Matilda!","Cyberkedi","Jan 06, 2015"

Chicago is a great sports city and this beer brings a lovely international character. The orange-gold color, steady carbonation and lively mouthfeel are are wonderful combination. Matilda has an alluring scent - yeasty citrus - that pulls you in. The breadth of the flavors are difficult to describe and the final product is truly wonderful.

Goose Island's Matilda is an interesting strong Belgian pale ale, but in my opinion it doesn't compare with the real titans of this style - and having had two bottles of this from different vintages, I feel pretty comfortable stating that. The Brettanomyces provides a unique  background tartness, and overall I must say that I do really enjoy this beer - but it's still no Duvel or Don de Dieu. Pretty good stuff; there's no doubt in my mind that I'll be drinking this again at some point.","thehyperduck","Dec 08, 2014"

Has a very mild, dry, woody taste, very mellow with a hint on the sweet side. It's medium bodied with ample amounts of carbonation.  Overall, this is an excellent belgian pale ale, probably one of the best I've ever had. Better still, I got this for peanuts at Costco, further raising my adoration of this beer.","Mavigo","Oct 14, 2014"

Great visible carbonation. This had a big, bright nose with lots of yeasty funk, some alcohol, clove/spice, and a hint of breadiness. Nice and complex, changed with time. This was such a nice, balanced sipper. Funk was a lot more mellow on the palate than the nose, hearty/bready notes, and some clean bitterness. Medium bodied, clean and clear presentation, and the notes that did linger were pleasant ones. I know that this is a Belgian 'Strong' Pale Ale, but for all of those breweries advertising 'Belgian IPA', this is what you should be chasing in my opinion. Pretty damn impressed with this $7 750ml...","Mikus","Oct 09, 2014"

4.1,1.5,4,4.5,4,3.75,4,"765 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. An orange amber color with four fingers of light beige creamy foam. Aroma is decidedly vinous, citric, and fruity: White grapes, pears, lemon and orange rinds, wine gums, with a little dough and an initially unassuming but slow burning brettanomyces funk. On the palate this one is dry, far less sweet than the nose might suggest, with a well-developed burlap sack/horse blanket flavor front and center, more pears and other under-ripe semi-sour orchard fruits (apples, apricots), watermelon rind, quinine bark (think tonic water), faint bubble gum, green banana ... A pleasant moderate phenol spice coupled with sour fruits and rather minimal sweetness, although the latter does develop over time. Fairly smooth, drinkable, low to moderate body, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish. Provides an interesting comparison to its stablemate Sofie ... More dry and tannic, less sweet and fruity. Stronger and perhaps more rustic. Excellent work, although I may swing toward the slightly sweeter.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 23, 2014"

Yeasty, slightly tart aroma featuring some spice, dried fruit, apple, and floral notes over a light pale malt base.  Smooth flavor of phenolic clove, apple, light bubblegum, and honey.  Medium bodied and lightly dry giving it some crispness.  A convincingly authentic Belgian-style beer with lots of yeast and only a touch of musty funkiness for fun.","wedge","Sep 22, 2014"

While the beer presents itself nicely in look and smell, the taste and mouthfeel leave something to be desired. The immediate taste isn't bad, effectively presenting an extremely yeasty but potent beer until it descends into a sharp, biting aftertaste that is along the lines of a cheap, high gravity malt liquor (I can equate it to the same kind of pungent taste of high-alcohol I got when swallowing Camo Silver Ice). After a few small to medium sips of this, the taste becomes overcompensating, to the point where the beer's introductory taste isn't even the slightest bit appetizing anymore, and I just sought to finish it as soon as possible. I can't see how this beer merits such exceptional ratings; it's one of the worst beers I've had all year.","SteveJeremy","Jul 20, 2014"

It's like a huge party where no one is wearing bright colors but no one looks the same. Very subtle, very diverse, very nice. The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly tingly. That's the technical terms if you were wondering. Didn't want to frighten anyone off. Overall, this is a great beer. It is many things, none of them overdone, and all of them done right.","roblowther","Jun 25, 2014"

Aroma of caramel malt, light stone fruit and mild oxidation. Flavor begins subdued dried light stone fruit, and light caramel, but the caramel intensifies towards the finish revealing bready malt and more intense stone fruit flavors, mildy buttery. Medium bodied. I took brief notes on this when I bought it fresh and they reveal that I was not too impressed with it, finding the flavors pleasant but underwhelming. I have been skeptical about the claim on the bottle that it would age for up to five years. I'm not in doubt now, this has turned out quite nicely. Still somewhat restrained, but the light fruit fruit flavor of the young beer have not so much intensified as become deeper, like dried fruit. Quite enjoyable and I will certainly age this one again if I see it.","LiquidAmber","Apr 16, 2014"

It has a spicy fragrance, goes down smooth for a Belgian ale, and has pleasant after taste.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 09, 2014"

I had to pace myself while drinking this and only a slight warming sensation that came over me as I polished this off led me to realize that there was booze in this. While not outstanding ,this was the best and most accessible example of this style that I ever had and worth a go for anyone who has never tried a Belgian-style Pale Ale or Strong Ale before. Not too sweet, funky, or overpowering, Matilda was a beer that I'd grab again as I await the transition to warmer days ahead. Subtly enjoyable and up to par with its European counterparts.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 07, 2014"

It's a white head with good lacing and active carbonation through the whole beer. The smell is over ripe bananas and some funkiness that's I can't really compare to another smell. Likely the Belgian yeast is driving that smell. The taste is wonderful with a dry apple flavor with sour notes. It's a great Belgian malt and yeast flavor. It's dry in the mouth and the sour lingers in a good way. Overall another good beer from goose island, they never seem to disappoint me!","GrumpyBeer","Jan 10, 2014"

Given that the label design mimics a fancy wine bottle label, this seemed appropriate, even though I know I've already probably broken some important beer rule. It has a very appealing honey amber color and slight foam: it reminds me of unfiltered apple cider, and, at first whiff, offers similar intense fruit. I'd characterize it as concord grape, with a background of mustiness, grass and hella yeast. The concord grapes follow through into the taste of the beer, IMO, though tempered by a refreshing dryness. And if it weren't for that inherent dryness, I'd have to say the lingering sweetness/fruitiness would really lose me, but evidently the brave men and women on Goose Island were one step ahead of my unsophisticated palate. There's also an appealing fizziness at work as a further counterbalance to that potentially cloying fruit. Overall? It's drinkable but hearty, sweet and sweet-tempered but slightly edgy (7% alcohol, oh my!), and definitely earnest, but in a good way.","TheVag","Dec 28, 2013"

4.22,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/20/2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a 2-3 finger foamy and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, apricot, orange peel, pear, apple, hay, floral, grass, candi sugar, caramel, pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of yeast ester, hop, and malt notes; with great strength. Taste of pineapple, peach, apricot, pear, apple, candi sugar, caramel, grass, floral, light funk, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, apricot, pear, apple, candi sugar, caramel, grass, floral, light funk, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of yeast ester, hop, and malt flavors; with a great malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian pale ale! All around great complexity and balance of yeast ester, malt, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a pale, dark gold, slightly cloudy, with good one finer head with lace patches. Aroma is a little flowery to me for some reason, also picking up some yeast, breadiness, a touch of sweet malts, and some tropical fruits like mango and tangerine. Mouthfeel is fuller thanks to some yeast, not too sharply carbonated but finish is dry and crisp, beer seems to be well-balanced as I get some bitter citric hops, some malty sweetness (caramel, candi sugar) and more of that pleasant tropical fruit rush like tangerine and pineapple (and dragonfruit according to my stepson). Overall just a really enjoyable beer that is representative of the style.","clayrock81","Oct 17, 2013"

4,-1,4.5,4.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and nice example of the style but I will have to track down a fresh bottle to compare it to because at this point I feel like the brett had really taken over and I think more of those fruity and Belgian Pale ale aspects that I got in the aroma would come through when it's fresh. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention but I think that the Brett would really start to wear on me and I think one 12oz bottle is the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both very good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how unbalanced the flavor was, it seems like the brett really took over. I would for sure buy a fresh bottle of this again, but I don't think I would get and aged one and I can't really see this getting any better with more age. I would recommend this to anyone who really likes brett forward beer, but it might be a little too funky for your average craft beer drinker. All in all I was happy i gave this beer a try, I could see this beer being pretty promising fresh, so I will for sure be looking for a fresh bottle and I will update this review accordingly. It's a nice beer but at this point it's a brett bomb. Nice work guys, this Belgian Series is my favorite thing you guys put out, keep on expanding the series.","StoutHunter","Sep 01, 2013"

I can smell the pilsner malt and I love that. It’s got a little booze in the nose but I’m not offended. There’s some caramel as it warms, a little spice and a bit of cinnamon. This beer is very rich on the palate. Orangey, Belgian yeast, musty, then pepper and coriander and hop bitter. Really well played like good hand in cards. Malt is pretty sweet and the body is a touch syrupy. This one is pretty wild with complexity but never disintegrates. Nice balance, crisp dry finish and puts bitter and honey together with a brett character and is inviting and intoxicating","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Aroma is caramel, sweet citrus, slightly spicy, a hint of alcohol, and vinous. Flavor is sweet malts, caramel, peppery, a bit of cinnamon, dark fruits, and yeasty. Mouthfeel is medium, fair amount of carbonation, a little cloying. Decent beer, a bit too sweet for my liking, I suppose the hops have all faded away.","mtstatebeer","Mar 08, 2013"

Smells of sugary malt with pomme and light pitted fruit and a hint of spice and pepper to round out the nose nicely. The flavor is sugary sweet with hints of honey and light sugar. Heavy fruit flavors remind me of pear, tangerine and sweet orange. Hints of spice provide the only balance to the sweet malt and fruit flavors. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is a nice Belgian strong, simple straightforward and quite enjoyable.","johnnnniee","Jan 27, 2013"

I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice light smell of hops. It was nicely carbonated but did not have a foaming head that one would expect. The color was of rust. The high point was a distinct sour flavor and sharp aftertaste, both of which make a good beer to pair with food. This could turn into a regular beer.","MrCee","Jan 01, 2013"

But I will admit that this beer is a fine one having delineated its various components. The strong pear notes up front are to be appreciated and the esthery gummy sweetness is a purposeful counterpoint to its inherent astringency. Ultimately, this beer finished smooth after a thoughtful, diverse rollercoaster of Belgian flavors and textures. Bet it's better on tap, though. Maybe even spectacular.","EdwardLongshanks","Sep 28, 2012"

4.29,6.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Hyper fizzy head on about a finger, off-white with an orange tint, all tiny bubbles which boil off at a sprint, retains a decent surface covering, the lacing at first leaves wide splotches but they don’t really stick much. Gauzy orange rust color, closer to yellow than to brown or red,strong whirlwind of loose bubbles zip about within, holds the light well within it, stays bright. This is a yeast dominated nose with banana, bubblegum, clove and sweet unbaked pie dough, also has a large black pepper component, truly not that funky, the peach, pear, fig scents clean and fresh, touch of coal tar or black tea leaf, ends with spiced orange peel notes. Full-bodied, at once bottom heavy and soaking into the palate while the churning carbonation lifts it into a decent perfume. Has a salty, saline quality to go with the pepper and clove, here more like a mix of fennel and Darjeeling tea. The orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus plays a major role, more sweet than sour. Supplements the apricot, pear, fit, banana fruit and sweetens further. The dough has a mildly more baked quality, not raw dough. Creamy texture extends finish and keeps it clinging to the mouth pores. Does a very admirable job of providing subtle complexity which would not turn off the neophyte while impressing the experienced.","farrago","Sep 28, 2012"

The head is big and soapy with a nice slightly-cream white head and nice sticky fat lacing on the sides creating cloud rings on the glass. The beer is mildly hazy, but is still quite opaque and there are a lot of nice little bubbles dancing up to the top of the glass. The beer smells thick with bananay yeast that makes me think of the jungle. There are some nice slight spices on the sides of the smell, perhaps a hint of cloves and something even more zesty. The malt is also not hiding in this smell, with a nice pale-sweet malt waftings. The beer tastes very similarly to its smell, with a great forward banana-taste from the yeast with slight clove and zest on the sides of and a solid sweet pale malt backing to the beer. There is almost a hot spice tingle on the tongue’s tip to start off this beer which is very intriguing. The mouth feel is smooth and lightly marbled. A perfect consistency for a pale ale. There is some weirdly harsh carbonation right at the front of the sip, but this dies away almost immediately and just leaves a slightly burnt feel on the tongue. After taste is very subtle and fresh with a faint weird medicinal funk, though this does not standout strongly. The mouth is left very clean after the sip with minimal saliva or dryness outside of the affects of the carbonation. There is very little sign of hops in this beer, which is fine in a Belgian Pale Ale, and this beer definitely delivers for its style. It is deliciously banana-like and its lacing is fantastically thick. Worth a drink for the Belgian lovers and the beer lovers alike, and definitely an upper level example of the style.","Maxwell","Jul 25, 2012"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a crystal clear amber color with hints of ruby. Head was neglible even with a moderately vigorous pour, though plenty of carbonation bubbles meander throughout the glass. Aroma is of sour cherry, bret yeast, and coriander. This bottle is dated over a year ago, and the flavor profile is different than what I normally think of for Matilda. The elements that were so evident in the aroma are present, but greatly tamed. Sourness is nearly non-existant, leaving the yeast and spice to take over the front end, though neither is especially dominant. A healthy dose of wheat comes in on the back end, along with some trace bitterness and some grassiness. A hint of alcohol makes its presence felt as well, but nothing glaring for a 7% ABV. Maybe it's the aging, or maybe I need to let it warm up some, but this is much more subdued than I remember. It's very drinkable, but it doesn't quite have the pep that I look for from a Belgian style ale.","MaximalC","May 26, 2012"

4.12,2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall (4.0): At about four and a half months old, this beer is relatively young but still manages to showcase a mild brett character that’s extremely well-crafted, in my opinion. Having had this at various stages, I can say that it will really come into its own around a year to a year and a half, and beyond that the brett will completely take over after a while. Which, if that’s your thing, then cool. If you’re interested in brett but a little scared of it, try this beer fresh-ish, like within six months after bottling. And if you’re somewhere in between, a year to a year and a half is perfect—at that point, it becomes a truly exceptional brett BPA.","fmccormi","Feb 27, 2012"

I wasn't familiar with Matilda (and didn't look it up), so when it was served, I took one sniff and said "nice, an American Wild Ale, my favorite". I passed it around and explained to the folks I was with what a wild ale is. Then I came to review it. Belgian Strong? Bottles infected? Maybe a keg or two as well...For a Wild Ale, it's actually spectacular. Had a great funky smell, but not overpowering. Some nice citrus and pineapple notes. A unique creaminess that combined nicely with the tartness. I ended up drinking three of these I was enjoying it so much. For a Belgian Strong, I'm not sure it even fits the profile, but again, the infected issue is what I'm suspecting.","Ralphs66","Feb 25, 2012"

Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like citrus (orange peel, lemons), yeast, apricots, pears, cloves, and some other sweet spices. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and apple flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has high, but soft carbonation which helps make this brew very easy to drink. I think it's a good overall beer, and it's definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","Feb 10, 2012"

I did get a deep-amber beer with NE-quality clarity, though. BUPGOO! If they were shooting for Orval, they came pretty close. It had a musty, yeast-driven nose with a lemon/citrusy character. Mouthfeel was thin and it had a slightly tart flavor on the tongue. Finish was dry and musty. I am glad that I did not wait much longer to open it, but it was still a serviceable beer. That said, I'll just have an Orval the next time.","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2011"

That being said, other than La Fin Du Monde this is my favorite Belgian inspired, light colored beer, if that makes sense. Hazy orange with a lot of yeasty gunk at the bottom, with an off-white head. Interesting fruity taste with a hint of belgian funk. Crisp and smooth, the reason I didn't rate it higher is because I have had some variance with quality amongst the different bottles I've had. All told, I'd buy it again. And again...","JNewbs","Jul 18, 2011"

It has a lot of flavor, is well-balanced, and certainly very drinkable. This is one that has the potential to grow on me a great deal.","DabblinWiscCraft","Jul 16, 2011"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Matilda pours a hazy orange with a thick head and solid lacing that lingers. Off the smell there’s a mix of hop oil, the sweetness of honey, lemon-y citrus notes, and cloves. The taste offers a plethora of flavors. Up front you get some bittering hops that give way to faint herb notes with hints of apples and fruit. The beer is slightly dry on the finish and hop oils linger but don’t overpower. This beer is very flavorful and has a rich mouth feel. Overall, this beer is crisp and smooth.","jmvecchio1","Jul 16, 2011"

Scent is a wonderful blend of tangerine, funk, dried grain, floral notes, some grapefruit noted along with spice. Taste follows scent but never comes together completely, notes of bubblegum and a lingering sweetness distract from the citrus, floral and funk notes. Bits of grass and spice present itself along with alcohol as it warms. Lighter side of medium bodied, active carbonation at first, dry with some lingering alcohol. A very nice beer a few adustments away from being great.","rfgetz","Jul 15, 2011"

3.65,-9.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, the best qualities of this brew are the striking look, creamy mouthfeel, and gently mild flavoring profile. Before the yeasty sediment is swirled into the glass the beer has great translucency, and a soft, full head. This all played into the mouthfeel, which kept things frothy, but light. This theme continued into the taste, where the flavors were present, but relatively muted, especially the brettanomyces. We actually found this quality to be inviting, as the beer doesn’t attempt to overload the senses, but rather gives suggestions of a more calm and relaxing evening.","TheBrewo","Jul 12, 2011"

An infected batch! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wood, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Based on the aroma on this one I was honestly expecting it to be infected. Upon investigation of the flavor there was no sign of infection to be found. Rather I found a really nice Belgian Strong Pale Ale waiting for me. This one was not complex at all, but this made it very easy to drink and a nice palate change-up for the night. Still want to try an actual infected bottle to see how it compares though.","thagr81us","Jul 12, 2011"

You can get it at pretty much any liquor store (sold in 4-packs if I do recall correctly) or by the bottle at places like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes… who likes a good tasting beer. It doesn’t taste like beer, and truly does get better with age.

Bittering hops are found floating all around the scent, this is a real treat on the nose. Nice citrus on the tongue, mixed an array of spices, clove, orange peel, pear juice, and pineapple all seem to fly past my tongue idividually and the malts seem to just melt in your mouth.

Very little carbonation with a dry finish. This brew was amazing, It blew my tits off. I was a little reluctant to try it because the packaging looked a little frou frou, much like a wine bottle.

Has some light hoppy notes and an interesting English malt aroma.Yeasty aromas as well with lovely floral notes. Taste is definitely yeasty with coriander and banana. Somewhat earthy and grassy with flowers and spiciness. It has some alcohol flavor to it as well. Mouthfeel is very nice...dry and somewhat fluffy. Very drinkable beer!

The taste is a little sweet up front with a nice fruitiness, I also get a little bit of spice and a distinct lemon note on the end.

The overall aroma is mostly comprised of bananas and orange zest with cinnamon all mixed into a bread if you will. The problem with the overall aroma is it is on the weak side for me there isn't really anything to smell. It's not bad, the smells aren't acrid, but it's just unimpressive. The taste is good. There is a very strong banana and orange flavor mixed with the brown sugar and caramel bread. The flavor would be delicious if it weren't bittering to the tongue. It's intentionally syrupy with bittering effects, without the real hoppiness to warrant the reaction. The boozy bitterness takes this from a good drinking beer to a fairly good drinking beer.

The beer is served a little too cold and the initial aroma is citric orange. Brett character starts to come forward as the beer warms. The flavor is grainy sweet with citrus and slight barnyard funk dominant as well as spicy hop notes. The flavor is really remarkable and I'm surprised to see Maltilda has such a low rating.

The taste is obviously related to belgian style ale but, there is a slight bitter malt (almost metallic) flavor at the back of my tongue, not what I associate with Belgian ales. The spicy flavors seem to be muted, I am wondering if there has been some oxidation, maybe that would explain the brown specks.

Tastes are a group of fruits, banana and pear comes through the most with a cloveiness, slight though. This is much less funky than the bottle version (which was aged), the tap is more fruity and yeasty, I guess this is mad fresh, it tastes it.

Poured a red-orangish color with a head that dissipated quickly. I wanted to say it had a clear look but it did develop a slight haziness. The appearance kind of turned into a flat look midway through however. Aromas were highlighted with sweet, tart fruits, raisins, a carmamelness, and the slightest hint of alcohol. I wasn't really getting the whiff of any pronounced hops. The hints of alcohol transferred over to the taste and mouthfeel. But not at all unpleasant. A sweet and slightly chewy mouthfeel that I actually enjoyed. My last thought about this beer is that maybe the version I loved from the ACBF was a bit more aged. This newest installment tasted slightly "green" as they say and the thing that really got me wondering was that on the side of the bottle it says that it can develop for up to 5 years. I'd love to age a bottle for a few years to see what would happen but unfortunatly I'm not that patient. If there's beer in the house I find it!

Reminds me of Avery Fifteen, but less brett and a bit more complex and ageable. The ever-so-slight sweetness really contributes alot to the brew.

I know Chimay is high-quality stuff, and Matilda is pretty similar, so that must be a good sign. I'm impressed by how authentically Belgian this beer seems. Goose Island must have gotten ahold of a nice yeast strain. While Matilda doesn't quite have the oomph of the likes of Chimay, it comes darn close.","Josievan","Feb 19, 2010"

The nose is of green apple, banana, bubble gum and yeast. The palate shows the same, with banana quite evident, ending in a spicy and reasonably dry finish. There is a definite crispness to the beer that makes it refreshing and extremely pleasant to drink. Carbonation is a real factor in this beer; the beer is spritzy and the bubbles dance on the tongue.

Carbonation is lively and tight, spritzing up the back and sides of the palate, and allowing the hops to take hold for a bitter, tasty finish. Overall, another winner from Goose Island.

However, the malt component of this beer holds a 7% ABV that tastes more like 10 and the brett really cuts through the yeast on its own.

I will swirl the next pour to capture some of the yeast if possible. The body is medium light with a very pleasant lingering. Vigorous swirling produced a very modest haze but increased the head and added some yeast notes. How much yeast are in these bottles? The Belgian ale characteristics are still restrained.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a thin yet chewy carbonation, the finish is slightly dry.

Low and behold, smell is pretty much the exact same as the taste. The feel is light, maybe bordering on medium, and much hotter than was expected. It definitely leaves you feeling a bit buzzed. Matilda has some very interesting qualities that I have not found in many other beers. That being said, I don't think I would go for more than one in a sitting.

The beer is not overly complex, and for that I'm going to detract a point or two. There isn't enough of an overlay between the spices, the sweet malts, the candied sugars, and the Belgian yeastiness to get this one going into a higher level.

Two inch tight, white head sizzled and popped as it slowly receded into a solid skim with a dense target of foam in the middle. Curtains of lacing were revealed as the brew was consumed. Detected some citrus (lemon zest) and yeast in the nose, as well as a spicey quality. Taste revealed many of the same characteristics of the nose, as well as malt, grass, candi sugar, maybe allspice, as well as light fruit (green apple and perhaps pear).

Some faint carryover from the nose with cloves and a hint of sweetness. Thin palate, decent carbonation and okay drinkability.

The flavor is also filled with fruity esters, with apples leading the forefront. There is a slight kiss of hops in the flavor but they add just more of a vague bitterness to it.

The beer is quite smooth, and the Brett character is still quite light in the finish. There is a hint of mustiness and a bit of dry cobweb-type thing that lingers in the finish, and a light dusting of funk in the rest of the beer.

Extremely mild citrus is there. But it is just a weee little bit. Flavor is a punch in the mouth. Firm and full. Sweet from sugars, yes. But the yeast plays a good part in it all and the full experience is well rounded and mature. Feel is a bit dough like on the liquid with a thick carbonation. Overall I have to say that this is a very good production of the style. We all know how it can be with American producers trying to work the Belgian styles. Not the case here. Quite good.

The flavor adds more fruit flavors to the citrus, with some apricot or peach. Prominent (Brett?) funkiness that tames the fruitiness. You can taste the hops bitterness if you concentrate on finding it, but it's only in a supporting role. A well-crafted and true to style Belgian, and quite drinkable.","MillRat","Dec 07, 2007"

Citric acidity throughout and a stiff peppery bitterness follows. Tea like florals from the start and notes fruity, orange rind and clove here and there. Hot for a 7.0, but can be easily ignored. A smooth mouthfeel fights with high carbonation that bites the tongue. As it warms earthier and somewhat charred grain characters become more apparent.","cabsandking","Dec 05, 2007"

The sourness mellowed and turned out to be enjoyable. The sweetness resembles nut bread. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy but nothing over bearing.

After letting it settle for maybe 5 minutes, it took me two more attempts to get it all out into the glass. Pours a nice hazy yellow, like a Belgian.

Today they brew beer and while we were traveling in Belgium we stopped in, heard the story and tried the beer. Really GOOD BEER and a GREAT STORY. Of course, we wanted to share what we'd heard and tasted. Uusually we'd do that over beers. This time we did it with beer. Recreating that experience wasn't easy.

At first smells are reminiscent of a Belgian tripel even though there was no mention of it. I assume that would have something to do specifically with the yeast strain and the basic recipe. Any how smells of Belgian yeast, some sugars, mild banana, cloves, pepper and some other spices. The taste is much the same, maybe at first a smidgen thin, but honestly it opens up and has a very pleasant after taste. To me this is a nice American version of a modified Belgian tripel.

2.36,-41.6,3,2,2,3,3,"Jen: I would have to say that I am not overly impressed with this "expensive" beer. It has sweet malty characteristics with a backing of citrusy apple fruits and hops. It is light in body and quite bubbly. It is easy to drink, but I don't think that it is worth $8.99. If you are trying to decide between this and another, go with the other.","denjen","Feb 24, 2006"

3.67,-9.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle. Orangish color with a small head. What a strange beer! The aroma is fruity, but somehow unlike any fruit I've eaten. It's sort of like fruit mixed with candy and ginger. Some wine-like grape flavors are present. Slightly tart, but still candy-like in it's tartness. Finishes with spices, including cinnamon and ginger. This beer left me confused and thirsty. Still not sure if I like it or not. It's certainly an interesting beer.","beveragecaptain","Jan 29, 2006"
3.85,-4.7,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This ale pours a candied orange color that leaves a bubbly white lace that sticks to the glass. The aroma is black licorice, root beer, horse blanket, wet grass, citrus, and candied fruit very complex. The taste is sweet on the palate, starts bitter with a black licorice/anis flavor in the background. It then hits with a dull alcohol presence on the palate that has some bitter bark bit on the tongue. Then it finishes semi-hoppy with a light carbonation, great brew glad I picked it up. I would pair this beer with a baked haddock stuffed with bread crumbs, oregano, and thyme. The savory stuffing and delicate fish will really compliment some of the licorice, canided aspects in the beer. Also the beer will act as the "squeeze of lemon" some people put on fish cause of the citrus aspect in this brew.","Franchise","Jan 26, 2006"

4.01,-0.7,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This one is an orange color, mostly, but not completely transparent, with a modest, unassuming head. The aroma is intriguing: spicy, estery, vinous, bits of yeast and bread, and a slight acid-like smell. Great! The taste is equally interesting: a malt base, around which there is yeast, apple flavors, a fleeting sourness, and pepper. The flavors work very well, and this one is a lot of fun to drink. The intensity of flavor is sort of low, but the whole package is noteworthy and enjoyable. Sprtizy and somewhat light mouthfeel. Quite drinkable. I wasnt disappointed with this one at all.","Suds","Jan 21, 2006"

3.91,-3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"a rollercoaster ride for sure, and probably one of the better (and more available) orval clones out there. still, as many people here said, there is something here prohibitive of greatness. i don't know if it's a lack of richness, an excess of sweetness, or a heavy hand with the hops. still, i'd drink a few more of these without question, especially considering the hefty price tag to its trappist cousin.","goodbyeohio","Nov 28, 2005"

Really fruity and estery. Apple and pear. Spicy as well with cinamon and pepper checking in. And yeasty doughiness as well. Nice nose. I notice some fusels first off on the buds. Then some spicy, peppery tones. Breadiness is diminished on the palate. Flavor not as full as the nose predicted. Carbonation is not as lively as I'd like. Just a little underwhelming.

Perhaps this is because this style may have been Americanized by Goose Island. Perhaps they have decided to forego the sweet taste of Belgian Pale Ales brewed in Europe and instead give it a good mix of a hoppy and spicy character. Whatever the case is I can only say that I prefer this brew to other Belgian Pale Ales I've had (How many times have I said that now? It feels that 4-5 might be an accurate count.).","becktone","Nov 01, 2005"

Floral and earthy hop notes are light but present. Ends with a spicy sweet finish that is a bit dry. Pretty smooth on the palette with enough body to carry the flavor.

Mild bitterness is accompanied by mild hop flavours. As it warms some fruitiness appears and the hop flavour becomes stronger. Some bitter orange peel adds character and there's a lingering citrus/spice combination in the finish. Slightly drying, it's generous carbonation is smooth and the attenuation is fairly high.
