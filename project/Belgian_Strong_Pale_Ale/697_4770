3.85,4.1,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Neat find on tap at Beer Revolution, one of the most unique brews I've had to date and could almost be its own style ... If oatmeal stout is sufficiently different to qualify as distinct, a beer made with red rice and sake yeast damn straight qualifies as well. Don't get me wrong, it does have some Belgian character. This brew is an unusual color that I can best describe as red apple juice, not quite as sparkly as the darker pale ales and IPAs, with a decent quantity of noticeably large white bubbles. Smells like nutty malt, rich sweet yeast, and fermented honey, along with some banana and spice esters. The taste diverges from Belgian though, butterscotch and strawberry vanilla custard (again with a hint of banana) with a pungent nuttiness like wild rice. The unique grist is really adding something distinct to the flavor. Although not aggressively boozy, the latter does reveal itself over time. I can also detect some floral, grassy hops in the middle. Fairly aggressive carbonation. The finish is crisp and there is a sake-like graininess that scrubs the palate clean after each sip. Wow. Fruity and yet still quite dry, with the wild rice nuttiness persisting right up until the finish. This one is a keeper and ignore the price point: Try it at least once.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 10, 2014"

Aroma is light bodied and grainy with a touch of yeast. Sweet honey notes flow in bring out the light malt. Taste is flat out great. Red rice malt gives the flavors of light pilsner malt and it's sweet grain character. Subtle amounts of light fruits from apples to a hint of strawberry and bubblegum . Trace honey and mild pepper lead into a dry finish with a mild Saaz hop signature. Super mellow Belgian yeast presence that ties it all together. The Belgo-fruit notes are here but in mild form as with the funk. I mentioned the dry finish. It is hard to do it justice as it is perfect and delicately done. A super quenching and refreshing beer that begs you to quaff as much as you like while packing a respectable alcohol wallop. Feel is light and creamy in the carbonation with a just right weight to the liquid, light and supple. Incredibly drinkable this beer is one of the best session ale I've had period. Flat Out Great Beer! I may not fir they typical BSPA profile but wow is to good.","scootny","Jan 01, 2014"

4,8.1,3.5,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,"The taste continues the theme of bizarre and intriguing. It is absolutely on the sour side with a fungusy yeast tone, but an oddly familiar flavour right behind it. It tastes like you're chewing on a flower....I want to say honeysuckle. It has an obvious sweetness to it, while not seeming all that sugary. It has a very smooth, thin mouthfeel, which unfortunately means no fun, but the thin, smoothness goes well with the sweet, flowery flavour. Despite this, the alcohol is oddly not present. It's 7% and has just a bit of citrusy hops to hide behind along with a very present funky yeast flavour. I'm not sure why it doesn't taste hotter. As a fan of alcohol flavour, I'm a little disappointed, but it's hard to be when this beer is such an all-around treat. It is very out there, very different from what I've had before, and very out-of-the-box experience.","ElCommodoro","Aug 09, 2013"

I actually was not a huge fan of the White Ale from Hitachino nest despite it being the highest rated Japanese beer period...(too spicy for my liking) but this little gem is a keeper. It's perhaps the most difficult beer to describe and break down in terms of smell and flavor, but it is quite amazing. Even at it's price point, it's worth having when you can. one of my favs","Swedgin_Wu","Mar 16, 2013"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"24 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in July 2012. Pours fairly cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big apple, pear, peach, clove, pepper, citrus zest, honey, bready grain, floral, grass, herbal, and earthy yeast esters. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, peach, clove, pepper, lemon, cracker, bready grain, honey, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of peppery spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, cracker, bready grain, honey, floral, grass, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; nice malt and yeast spiciness balance; and zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian style golden ale! Very nice complexity and balance of fruity and spicy esters with malt balance; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. This was a very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 16, 2013"

There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is bready malt, rice, raspberries, strawberries, and some nuts. It tastes like bready malt, rice, artificial strawberries/candy, and a bit of a red wine/grape flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation.

There is some hop bitterness on the back end. I can also taste some of the malt and some alcohol kick. There is some citrus tartness to this as well. It's definitely interesting in the flavor department. This beer is medium bodied with abundant carbonation. It is smooth and drinks fairly well.

Glad to try, but not sure I would call this highly drinkable. It's an acquired taste - interesting, challenging to define, delicate and complex, and to that end good overall. But I can't see myself going out of my way to get it again.

Alcohol is lightly hot, but it doesn't detract from the taste. Highly fruity yeast character, as the aroma indicated. I've had sekihan, but this doesn't resemble the flavor, far as I remember.

Maybe this is one of those good normal beers that the latest Beer Advocate magazine is talking about; where you don't need to have these extreme flavors.

There is a lot of sediment floating around in it like a snowglobe (I assume this is the reason for the snowy owl on the label?) and this beer, if nothing else, looks really great. Didn't like the smell, which I can only say struck me as a sour pilsner smell. Taste was not bad, different somehow (which I guess is the rice?), but just pretty so-so.

First you get that orangey zest, which is just perfect, and then you taste the wheat. Although a little pricey ($5-6 I believe), it is well worth it. Once you snap off the cap the smell alone will intrigue you. There is so much going on in that smell. The red rice, the orangey smell, the wheat--it's damn enticing.

Add an orange-tangerine-peachy colour to this you have a one-of-a-kind beer. It doesn't disappoint. It tastes less like a gummy bear than you'd think from the smell and that general 'fruit' flavour turns in to a strawberry-like flavour. Toss in some yeastiness and some graininess, then some toasted rice and an almost earthilike quality and you get Kiuchi's Hitachino Nest Red Rice.

The finger of head with good retention had a pinkish cast to it. Very different in my experience. The beer's color was a hazy reddish-pink, which suddenly put me in mind of the disaster area that is Chelada. The nose was cotton candy-like in its sweetness, like strawberries and sugar. Perhaps a bit too sweet for this guy. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a definite strawberry presence on the tongue. MUCH more drinkable than the nose had led me to expect.

A friend of mine nailed the smell of a jar of green olives. Which doesn't sound appetizing - but if you can get past this, you may still enjoy this beer.

Towards the middle, I get some apple, a big hit of strawberry, and some underlying mint. Finish is interestingly grainy (almost reminds me of steamed buckwheat groats) and drying. Extremely interesting, but there is the slightest cough medicine background note that bugs me just a bit. This kind of tastes like Strawberry & Cream Mad Dog (in the best way possible). Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a carbonation that is arousing but never becomes bothersome. Drinkability is really great, but there is a sweetness that lasts about the middle that wears on me.

This is a very unique beer that definitely could complement certain Asian cuisine. I think this could be good with a barbecued pork bun, for example.

It also has a buttery feel in the nose. A very complex appealing smell. The taste is kind of like brown rice, sadly I've never actually eaten brown rice so I wouldn't know if it's similar. It tastes sweet and well rounded. I can't detect any hops whatsoever. What are they using for a bittering agent? Could it be that the rice can provide both silky sweetness and enough bitterness that hops are rendered unnecessary? I must investigate. The appearance is like rust. That's the best I can do on that front. I don't really care about that anyway. As for drinkability and mouthfeel... It slides easily down the throat and I could drink it for a long time.

The body falls a bit weak from the souring. Musky and earthy with yeasty and almost moldy, the beer stays crisp and clean. Approaching astringent levels, it is very good and thirst quinching.

The taste brings some complexity, but also lots of sourish red rice that's a bit overpowering. The mouthfeel is pretty good, actually -- the carbonation is nicely balanced and the finish is good.

The sweetness has a fruity quality. but of exactly what fruit I do not know. The interplay between the tart and sweet elements is interesting. Tartness seems to diminate at first, however after the brew warms up more sweet character is apparent. Just a bit of spice is noted towards the middle of the sip. Finish is milder and has an interesting grainy, yet wine-like quality which I guess is the rice. Red Rice is definently an interesting concoction, but not something I think I'd want very often.

4.35,17.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hitachino Nest's Red Rice Ale is certainly one of the most unique beers available. It pours a hazy deep gold body that streams with effervescent carbonation beneath a 3/4" cap of fluffy, bright-white foam. The head retention is very good and it leaves some nice spots and thins splashes of transient lace throughout the glass. The nose is quite unusual with an aroma that expresses wheat, but is also similar to that of a dry white wine combined with a touch of play-doh. It's light-medium bodied with a very delicate, effervescent carbonation that lends a mild zest to the tongue before it warms in the mouth becoming airy and slightly creamy. There's an odd, almost medicinal, lightly tart, and slightly candyish note in the flavor that's quite unique. It's kind of like delicate spice wrapped in soft, creamy candy - all tied together with a twine of dried flowers. It finishes with its sweetness rapidly fading as its tartness and bitterness rise; and a mild bitterness, spicy hop, light phenolic, and some astringency linger in the mouth. As odd as it is, it's also quite delicate; and in that way it becomes quite enticing. There are some harsh notes to it; but there are also harsh notes in the best Belgian gueuze. They're what gives it it's character, and this beer is nowhere near as intense as a gueuze. You may not love it, but it's certainly worth trying.

4.02,8.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a light orange color with a light head that leaves some light lacing,aroma is of grain alcohol and some green apple.I have had saki only a few times but I pick up a big saki flavor to this brew in the finish along with a light smokiness and like a few others a light olive juice flavor as well.A real odd and perplexing beer but it kinda grown on ya after a few drinks,glad I gave it a try.","oberon","Apr 12, 2004"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Good drinkability, very clean. Not hugely complicated, but nothing I could pick out as being wrong, nice to see rice used for once in a good way. It's here to improve the beer and make it unique.","mschofield","Mar 23, 2004"
3.2,-13.5,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This was an interesting brew. The beer pours a cloudy deep orange with a pinkish hue in the foam. The combination of prune juice and seltzer water came to mind. The foam quickly dissipates. The aroma definitely has a rice or bean aroma. The mouthfeel was a bit thin with effervescent carbonation. Rice flavor with just a bit of fruity sweetness plus some sour notes that finished with a slight alcohol aftertaste. I have enjoyed some other offerings from this brewery but I dont believe I will be trying this one again anytime soon.","Plughfish","Mar 18, 2004"
4.08,10.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability is hard to decide it is different. It is a must drink just because of how different this stuff is.","Zorro","Mar 16, 2004"
2.93,-20.8,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Big tamarind character on this one maybe with some saffron. Unique and very evident of wild rice, but off-putting and offensive on its own. As one who loves sake, I can see where Hitachino is coming from with this and I think they've made something remarkably complex. Paired with sushi or any peanuty thai dish, this could be very special.","ngandhi","Feb 01, 2004"
2.06,-44.3,4,3,1.5,3,1,"Not a good beer. I have no problem with a tart beer, even a sour beer, when that is appropriate, but here my impression was a wheat beer with a good measure of green olive juice tossed in. The beer had an odd, acidic backdrop to the flavor that reminded me of something cured in brine. I like a "dirty" martini with a bit of olive juice, but the flavor turning up in beer was not pleasant. I thought perhaps it would grow on me, and I gave the beer every chance, but in the end it was a sink dump. Perhaps this is one of those love-it-or-hate-it beers. I fall in the latter category.","Brent","Oct 21, 2003"
4.47,20.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one odd and very unique drink-in a deliciously good way. As the finish from my last sip lingers on and on an on, I have to ruminate rather deeply about what to say here. The color is much that of a framboise-hazy blonde ale color, yet with a raspberry tinge. The head is sushi rice color and sticks to the glass rather well. The aromatics are lovely, clean and fresh with the delicate fruitines one finds in fine sake. The rice gives off an almost tapioca like odor with some vanilla, melon, faint strawberry and definate sake flavors. The alcohol is at once warming, yet the beer is wonderfully refreshing at the same time. Again, like the white ale this beer screams out for food, and I'm talking Japanese food. The beer actually reminds me of the flavors redolent of sushi. I can taste clean rice flavors and even a meaty/fishy flavor, almost tuna like. This is really fun to drink and I'm now planning my meal to accompany this fine beverage. Bravo!!","moulefrite","Sep 05, 2003"
3.68,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Medium gold color, medium head. Aroma is malty and yeasty, kind of champagne like. It's a cross between a pilsner and sake. Somewhat sweet, somewhat sour. There is a subtle hoppyness that builds on the palate. Light a refreshing. Carbonation is also champagne like, lots of small quickly disappearing bubbles. Interesting beer. Has a definite rice-like taste to it, but in a good way, not at all like Bud etc. Interesting beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Hides the 7 % alcohol well. I like it when brewers take chances with their beers. Very different and worth trying.","beerguy101","Aug 22, 2003"
3.61,-2.4,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Another unusual offering from Kiuchi. Honey/Amber colored with a fast dissipating off-white head. The aroma is mildly reminiscent of cooked rice and white bread. The body is light and clean tasting. A mild hop taste mingles with a slight astringent fuminess. A seltzery effervescence remains throughout the glass. How do they do it? The 8.5% ABV is not noticeable in the flavor or aroma.","BeerResearcher","Jul 18, 2003"
3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a cloudy gold color and formed a bubbly white head that left some circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of citrus and some floral aspects. A flavor of citrus, rice and some grain elements. The finish was sprite and somewhat sudsy. I really can place this beer style wise, so it is difficult to form a good feel/opinion for this beer.","Wildman","Jul 08, 2003"
3.91,5.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This ale poured a hazy, light straw color, with tall, fluffy, persistent foam that clung to the sides of the glass. The smell was initially reminscent of sake with hints of lactic acid and malt sweetness and a bit of hops and some grapes. The initial flavor was very tart, almost sour, but after a few drinks I became accustomed to it, and it reminded me of a sour lambic, in that regard. Over flavors detected: a vinous taste, slightly musty, floral hops, malt. The mouthfeel was initially tart with a good bit of hops in the finish. The body was medium-light with modest carbonation feel. Surprisingly, I would have never guessed that this ale was 8.5% abv. This ale was quite drinkable and really grew on me as I sipped it. An interesting and unusual ale from Japan.","UncleJimbo","Jun 07, 2003"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall a nice change of pace ale. Intriguing little beer that packs lots of flavors and just a wee bit of alcohol (8.5%). Not an everyday brew for me but one I would buy again just for its difference.","purplehops","May 20, 2003"
2.69,-27.3,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Transparent peach color with extremely active head, surprised at the lacing despite the soda like carbonation. There is very little aroma. The flavor is neither hoppy, malty, nor ricey. I do not get the hype. I do not think this is more than a gimmicky Budweiser (Bud use a lot of rice). Has an odd body odor flavor. Highly carbonated. Lame. I would not bother trying this again.","Naerhu","May 03, 2003"

3.3,-10.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The second time around it had a bitter/sour finish on the tongue and palate. It poured a deep orange yellow with no difference in the foam as the first time. I have down graded this beer by one point, all around.","BeerManDan","Jan 02, 2003"
4.23,14.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"What a funky little brew! Hazy golden/beige with a fluffy white head. As others have noted, the carbonation ensures that a nice, sticky lace stays around for the duration. What an odd aroma -- wild rice, a touch of tart fruitiness (strawberry, kiwi), more rice enveloping the aroma. Also something else in there -- green olives? -- which is strange and yet intriguing. Everything about the taste is subtle, yet also intriguing. First, there's a mild malt undertone that holds up the brew, with starchy, wild-rice flavors, creamy. Some medicinal flavors, intoxicating. Alcohol seems hardly there (which is Ninja-dangerous), except for the slight peppery finish, where I also noticed the closest resemblance to sake. This would have been perfect with my dinner tonight -- take-out from the local Japanese steakhouse. And oh yeah, the owl is very cool.","mophie","Oct 01, 2002"
