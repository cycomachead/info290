4.26,1.9,5,4,4.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a huge 3 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, apricot, citrus zest, pear, apple, white grape, candi sugar, honey, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, apricot, citrus zest, pear, apple, white grape, candi sugar, honey, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, citrus zest, pear, apple, white grape, candi sugar, honey, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2014"

3.99,-4.5,4,3.75,4,4,4.25,"on tap at the bull and bush, who have really expanded their guest offerings in the last half year or so. this is my first from these guys (i think), a real treat. listed on the menu at 8.9% abv rather than the 10% abv listed here, but i am attributing that to batch variance rather than misinformation. a great beer, a spring strong blonde brewed with honey. it looks, smells, and tastes a lot like a classic tripel, maybe a little lighter in body, a little more aggressively hopped, and a little lighter on the leftover sugar, but the belgian yeast, pale wheat based body, and booze component are all on par with the style. some floral character to this, and a real easy drinking lightness for its enormity. i know this isnt one of the rare crazy beers from these guys, but its a heck of an introduction to a very storied brewery for me. i know i am late to the party, but this one has me keen for more. so dry in feel, and for a fuller bodied strong beer, its a nice touch. cool yeast, not overdone, and nice crispy carbonation. top tier brew, just a little less interesting than i hoped for, but real yummy.","StonedTrippin","Jul 10, 2014"

4.41,5.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bos Keun has a gorgeous cloudy auburn color, with a bleached-white, billowing tower of bubbles rising with even the most miniscule pouring effort. This head is similar to angel's food cake... somehow, it has mass but it's very light and airy. The amount of bubbling is almost too much, but I did not score this very negatively due to some of the other classic Belgians, like Duvel, having this effect. Of course with this type of head we get excellent lacing as a result. The smell is very syrupy sweet, like toffee and taffy, along with tropical fruits and the signature whiff of Belgian yeast. I found the flavor to be reminiscent of caramel apples at the fair, very tart, and slightly astringent. Delicious pear and citrus esters as well. The mouth feel is somewhat viscous, and the finish was very sharp. Overall, this is right up there with the other exquisite brews from De Dolle. This is a top Belgian Brewer that any fan of the style must try.","Neorebel","May 19, 2013"

Served in a Chimay chalice, a honey brown color, slightly cloudy, with a huge rocky, tan-white head that retained well and coated the glass with decorative lacing. Aroma was booze-heavy, phenols, yeast, more yeast, and a bit herbal when all that mellowed out a bit. Taste was extremely potent, strong with grainy alcohol, a concentrated dose of meadow grass and flowers hitting soon after that, lighter notes of peppery yeast and citrus pith. Strong, but flavorful. A little too hot to be exceptionally drinkable I'm afraid, but still a fine brew overall. Maybe let this one sit in the cellar for a year or even more to mellow out before serving.","Rifugium","Apr 06, 2012"

Lots of carbonation, fairly dry. Spicy flavor, solid malt base, but not a lot of sweetness. Dry finish. Very drinkable at 10%. Didn't get a lot of alcohol in the flavor, just a little in the aroma.

I really enjoyed the EES mentioned above, but the extremity of its taste cost it some drinkability. BK, on the other hand, I could drink this all day. Very different from its outlandish cousin. It's consistent and creamy, and the sweet, light fruits come together wonderfully with the choice of malt. A kind of medium gravity pear/mango experience with the perfect amount of bitterness throughout.

There is green pear and some stone fruits. The nose is slightly buttery as it warms. Not diacetyl--it's more of a chardonnay-type butter character.

Nose reminds me of fresh green apples and cider, slightly yeasty. Very pleasant nose. The taste is fantastic, fresh apples, pale malt, light white pepper from the yeast and other sharp spices all from the yeast. Very creamy mouth-feel, the beer was a slight gusher and it was confirmed to be over-carbonated once in the mouth. Overall, a very pleasant beer that has some very positive notes but it just misses pulling it all together to be one of the best.","nas5755","Dec 16, 2010"

Light and prickly thanks to some spices and sharp carbonation. Has some fruit tastes like a minor tropical fruit taste as well as citrus/orange w/ that typical Belgian yeast strain. Also some sweetness like caramel and honey w/ the sweet and fruit/hoppy flavors well balanced for a very tasty and enjoyable brew.

As expected, the bottle slowly gushed forth before the pour. Can't locate bottle date, I think it wore off the cap. Head retains for quite a while, it looks soft, I'd like to take a nap on its pillowey bubbles. Aroma is bursting out of the tulip as the head reduces. Smells like peaches, a little funk, and a slight alcohol burn. The mouthfeel stands out on this one as the flavors coat the tongue front to back. Certainly doesn't taste at all like a 10% ABV, a testament to how well the flavors are melded together. The flavors are all over the map and they seem to be changing as the temperature of the beer warms. Fruit sweetness mixes with funk to create a delicious treat.

More and more I'm finding incorrect numbers...) currently above, and the alcohol isn't as prominent as one may figure. All of the Belgian points of interest are there in spades, and I'd love to see how these are years and years down the road, as they're probably always changing with the yeast being such a huge part, usually floating around just with a light bump.

Pure, fresh smell, bursting through with florals, esters, and candy... Taste was equally sweet, with grapefruit, caramel, vanilla, and sugar notes... Seems as if De Dolle has a penchant for brewing some seriously thick, rich, and sweet beers, because this one exactly fit the bill... Extra-creamy, ultra-thick mouthfeel led to a pretty good level of drinkability, especially due to the not-over-the-top ABV of 7%...

The head falls, eventually, leaving some nice foamy patches of lace on the glass. Body is grainy gold. Smell: stark, musty sourness upfront, a good thing; followed by an aged bleu cheese yeast funk that has a nice texture to it, not at all unpleasant; the finish is a cotton-candy sweetness riding out over the top. Taste: complex sweetness upfront (cherries, brown sugar), with an underbelly of toasted pecans, sourdough bread; the middle is a strong punch of funky yeast, really nice, peppery and moldy (this is a good thing, trust me); the finish, much like the nose, goes back to a sharp sweetness that rides out over the top of the depth of complex flavors. Spicy, dry aftertaste. Lovely. Mouthfeel: creamy, very carbonated which is a good thing as it helps zip up the strong flavor in a nice, tight mouth-package. Wonderful brew. Glad I found a bottle, purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California -- looks to be about a 12 ounce bottle. Love the buck-toothed rabbit on the label.

The finish hums on a bitternut, roasted banana peel and fruitseed vector. Broad in scope, it is a bookends of funky sweetness and twiggy hops extract.

De Dolle's website recommends not aging this beer for too long, I've had it for a few months so I'd imagine this bottle is this year's batch. Pours a peachy golden color with some cloudiness to it. Volumnous off-white head that doesn't want to subside so I can add the rest of the bottle to the glass. Lightly spicy in the aroma and some subdued apple-like fruitiness amongst pale malts and a slight honey-like sweetness. Rather sweet and lightly fruity, and finishing spicy and a mild alcohol burn. The beer's character becomes better IMO with the addition of the yeast; it imparts a further apple-like or passionfruit esters and a bit of nutty, wild character to it. Mouthfeel seems rather thick, but not offly so. Well carbonated, it burps kind of perfumy. Light spicings are nice and a good addition to the beer. Rather nice, but a touch sweet.","crookedhalo","Nov 06, 2004"

(As with the other De Dolles, don't pour too gently because some of that carbonation is meant to come out). Smells of sawdust, lime, ginger als, metal, and lilac petals. Strongly aromatic yet composed completely of subtleties. Taste is dry hay, strongly phenolic spice, hints of cotton candy and lime, and makes a bite that leaves a dry white pepper and grass lingering flavor. Start is light-flavored medium-bodied sweetnes.

The bottle cap had some mold UNDER it which was kind of weird but I'm open minded. The appearance was fine - a cloudy orange-yellow, with a nice white - off-white head. The aroma was interesting but hinted at more complexity than I found in the beer - there were traces of black walnut, a pungency reminescent of vinegar, and a little maltiness and an alcoholic hint. The flavor was sweet and tart with some alcoholic warmth, but it lacked a solid malty base and also lacked the layers of complexity you get with some of the other soured beers like lambics and Old-Bruin type beers.

Tiny bubbles rise in plumes from the base of the goblet indicating a very fine and somewhat effervescent bottle-conditioned carbonation. The aroma is mesmerizing in its sweet fruitiness. It's clearly candyish, but also laced with an odd combination of light and dark fruits (apples, dates). As expected, its lightly zesty on the tongue with a very fine, somewhat effervescent carbonation. A touch of caramel maltiness and some vanilla comes into play in the flavor; and it's not as candyish as the nose suggests (but still sweet). The fruitiness, however, remains with some crisp green apple that works well with the emerging note of alcohol, and some dates that emerge in the aftertaste.

Nonethless, a nice looking dense, yet uniformly bubbly, cream colored head forms atop the volcanic, slightly hazed gold laboratory experiment below. In other words, this beer looks like it has hot flame torching it from below. Vigorous carbonation is visible to say the least. Aroma is a sweetly spiced concoction of dough, yeast and bubblegum esters. Quite nice. Not surprisingly, the taste is a bit caustic, but not overbearing in the context of the other flavors. The heat not only comes from ethanol, but probably a few higher alcohols and esters as well. A sweet candied like blanket cloaks that harshness and damn near swallows it up at times. This beer has a little of that "Tale of Two Cities" thing going on. Best of times, worst of times...abrasive, yet mellow...harsh, yet mild and drinkable....fiery, yet soothing...acetic acid mixed with sucrose....corrosive, yet healing at the same time.

Nose is a blend of spicy, musty funkiness with just a subtle hint at dried fruit. I sensed somewhat of a smokiness lingering in the aromatics, which I'm guessing is from the age of this beer and the decreased presence of its hop character. Flavorwise, I got tart, herbal citrus with somewhat of a bitter lemon rind character and a bone-dry, biting finish. As the beer approached standard room temperature, some fruity apricot notes became more apparent, but I never experienced the honey flavor others note. The yeast character never strays too far, and it's definitely that of the aged variety. The highly carbonated, prickly mouthfeel was quite nice, but the dry, tanginess of this beer and the seemingly off flavors kept it from being overly drinkable. I may very well have sampled a bottle that was indeed past its prime, as this is the only beer with which I've been disappointed from De Dolle. It did, however, have some solid attributes, but I think it may need to be drunk fresh, rather than aged like this particular bottle.","Jon","Nov 17, 2003"

4.47,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pale cloudy orange with lots of yeast specs and huge billowing white head. Aroma to die for, spicy (white pepper) with a tart lambic-like mustiness. The taste is slightly malty sweet, intensely spiced (almost hot) and finishes amazingly dry. There's a little tartness mixed in and a nice warming alcohol hit as well. Excellent.","pbrian","Jan 14, 2003"
4.28,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Wow, what a great little brew!!!!!!! Peppery and even hoppy nose. Nice malt pressence (adds a bit of sweetness at the start). Quite peppery, salty and bitter acid finish, quite complex, and very enjoyable.","rastaman","Aug 04, 2002"
4.55,8.9,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Beautiful golden-amber colored beer with a big, rocky head.  Aroma filled with spices and yeast.  Flavor follows the aroma, spicy, with yeast undertones.  Also some fruit lingering in the flavor.  Overall, one helluva good drink!","Viking","May 18, 2002"
4.35,4.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A very interesting brew, which I should have expected from De Dolle.  Nice orange color with fruity aromas.  Sweet with fruit flavors.  Shares some flavors with De Dolle's Stille Nacht.  You can feel the alcohol in the beer, but it was not overwhelming.  Didn't realize the ABV was as high as it is until I started feeling it hit my head :) Overall, not my favorite De Dolle brew, but a very good beer none the less.","jreitman","Apr 28, 2002"
4.2,0.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,"Hazy orange with a thick, creamy persistent head.  Lots of chunky yeast sediment combined with the fairly high carbonation provide for a lava lamp like experience.  This is an intense beer from start to finish.  The smell is dominated by a powerful candy like sweetness, with a touch of green apple (acetaldehyde).  It reminds me of candied granny smith apples.  The taste is almost cloyingly sweet, with complex fruitiness, slight caramel and date - like flavors..  The slight acetaldehyde, although normally a flaw in most styles, really adds to the complexity of this unique beer.  Hop bitterness is barely perceptible.  I noticed a bit of fusel alcohol in the finish.  A truly unique beer-- it's like nothing Ive tasted before.  I don't think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting, however due to the intense sweetness.","marc77","Mar 10, 2002"
4.84,15.8,4,5,5,4,5,"The smell and flavour of this brew do it for me, big fruity esters with a sweet pale malt base. Has hints of almonds and mango with a warming alcohol. I know it is their spring beer but this is one that could be aged a year or perhaps more and still gain in complexity.","Jason","Nov 17, 2001"
4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Purchased at 't Brugs Beertje in Brugs for 140 BF, by Todd. 7% abv, and very drinkable. This beer is huge in character and complexity. Can't really say to much more about it as we are in awe of this beer.","BeerAdvocate","Oct 22, 2000"
