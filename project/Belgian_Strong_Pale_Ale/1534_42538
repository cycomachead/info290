4.12,1.2,,,,,,"Notes of metal and tar are unexpected in aroma. There's an estery profile of banana, clove, pear skin, and apple accompanying a fairly sweet dark fruit and caramel malt backbone. Notes of figs and dates become more pronounced as it warms. Flavor is exceedingly sweet initially, with caramel malt and treacle dominance. Luckily, esters of tart green apple and pear, along with sherry oxidation, counter and add complexity. Still fairly hot, with alcohol warmth lingering in the finish.figs and dates add depth as it warms. Fairly complex beer, which will probably continue to age well.","barczar","Dec 04, 2014"

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"2012 vintage - Poured a cloudy orange with two finger head that left lace and stuck around a long time for better or worse. A spicy and yeasty aroma with touches of tropical fruit and a touch of floral hops as well sweet and breadlike malt. Smooth and easy to drink with a light to medium body, there is a liveliness and crispness in this beer thanks to some spice and carbonation and the alcoholo gives it a heated snap on the finish. The fruit flavors and malts are balanced and I'd say you can equally detect some plush tropical fruit like pineapple with citric hoppy orange alongside both sweet and grainy malts. Overall I just found this beer to hit the right notes in terms of balance and taste and I really enjoyed it this dangerous sipper.","clayrock81","Jul 04, 2013"

4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/9/2009. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apricot, pear, golden raisin, apple, banana, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, herbal, light pepper, clove, floral, and herbal earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; with zero alcohol presence. Taste of apricot, golden raisin, pear, apple, banana, honey, candi sugar, clove, herbal, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, honey, candi sugar, clove, herbal, light pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes; with a great malt balance and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with and slick and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong pale ale! Great complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy esters; and very smooth to sip on for 10%. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

This could be good as a share for dessert, make a fruit crumble or a cheese plate. I wonder if the b lue is as sweet.","unclejazz","Jan 12, 2012"

All I can pick up is some muted honey cream and some pale malt sweetness with perhaps some clove. The flavor is light and sweet. It tastes of honey, clove, pale malts, with a light trace of alcohol. I'm surprised at how subdued the alcohol is for the content. Despite the short list of adjectives I used to describe the flavors, it's actually very, very good for the style. I'm pretty impressed by it. It drinks exceptionally smooth, being at just over three years old. This is a very good Belgian Strong Pale and worth trying.","aasher","Mar 18, 2011"

No appreciable alcohol or hop flavor- this could certainly benefit from another 10 - 15 IBU of bittering to balance the overwhelming (but not extremely malty) sweetness.

Overall this was one of the best light Belgians I've ever had. It was very delicate and clean, but still flavorful and delicious. It had a very refined body with the natural carbonation, and it hid the alcohol amazingly well, so it was quite easy to drink. I could enjoy this beer often, and highly recommend it. I need to find a fresh bottle, since my sample was over a year old, and I'd also be curious to try one with several years on it.

4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a clear golden color and formed a huge pillowy foamy snow white head that refused to subside and coated the glass with lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus, Belgian yeasts, hops and spices. The flavor was of malt, hops, bread, pepper and phenolics. The body is fairly light and the finish rather sprite yet peppery.","Wildman","Dec 14, 2008"

4.42,8.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I bought this nottle (750ml, corked & caged) for $9.99 at Whole Foods in Columbus. This was the first time I've seen this version from Gouden Carolus, "Special Blond of the Emperor". The beer was pale yellow color with a little haze, and a thin but lasting film of bubbles. The smell is really good, honey and sweet malts, similar to Grotten ale from St Bernardus (high praise). The taste is just as good, this could be Barbar or Grotten ale rebottled. Near-perfect flavor and drinkability, this is great beer.","TurdFurgison","Nov 08, 2008"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"(Bottle) Pours golden with a huge white head. The aroma is of doughy, ester-ish and spicy yeast with undertones of candi sugar, pears, red/yellow apples, fresh and dried oranges, tart white grapes, subtle tropical fruits, mild lime, bubblegum, wine gum, vanilla powder, fresh nutmeg, coriander, mild white pepper and almond paste. Also some hospital/clove-like phenols. The malt and the aromatic hops bring tones of grain, dry crackers, white bread, spices, fresh grass and mild flowers. Wood dry hints from the alcohol, yet elegant on the nose. At the same time, there is a good deal of almond paste sweetness present. The alcohol warmth also holds some hints of nail polish. The flavour is of mild citric and fresh spicy with balanced tones of herbal hops, cracker/white bread-like malt, candi sugar and some phenolic hints lurking in the background. Hints of nutmeg, pepper, tart white grapes, apples and pears, black wine gums are all notable. The mouthfeel is dry (some sweetness in the beginning), round and clean without being lifeless with a carbonation that adds some champagne-like qualities. In the aftertaste linger phenols, citrus, candi sugar and a light bitter hop sting. Medium to full bodied. A very well made example of the style.","Blursimarsi","Nov 01, 2008"

2.98,-26.8,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,2,"Pours a very pale golden color with tons of carbonation and an immense white rocky head that goes nowhere. Great lacing sticks to the glass. Smells of honey, candy sugar, belgian yeast, spices, pear, very pleasant. Smells a lot better than it tastes. Initial sip, while still very cold, was extremely biting with alcohol. Bitter, extremely phenolic. As it warmed up, more flavors came through like doughy malts, the yeast, some honey, hops, but the alcohol presence was still very much there. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, extremely carbonated, with a somewhat dry finish. Drinkability factor definitely lacks.","Doomcifer","Aug 05, 2008"

Smells Belgian, but doesn't seem to have a lot of refinement. Flavor has a bit too much strength and doesn't have a lot of delicacy or complexity. Sweet, it possesses heavy notes of light fruits and alcohol. This Belgian misses the mark.","Crosling","Jul 29, 2008"

3.93,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Review Number 250. Served in my Maudite tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a dense, two-inch bright white head and copious tiny bubbles evident in solution. Strands of sticky lacing spotted the sidewalls of the glass during the tasting. Alcohol was clearly identifiable in the nose, followed by candi sugar, belgian yeast and a hint of tropical fruit (perhaps passion fruit) detectable at the back. Taste consistent with nose, as well as a citrus astringency present up front; however, flavors are somewhat masked by the alcohol. Consistency is between light- and medium-bodied with a considerable carbonation burn concentrated up front and then dispersed throughout the mouth, with a booziness that lingers at the finish. Nice offering, but drinkability is impacted by the over-representation of alcohol imposed on the senses.","Jwale73","Jul 22, 2008"

4.1,0.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"750ml bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a golden yellow hazy body with a good inch of off-white head. Smells fruity and spicy. Tastes citrussy (orange/grapefruit) with spice (coriander? clove?) and the slightest hint of caramel malt toward the finish. On the lighter side of medium in body with ample carbonation. A fairly easy drinker considering the ABV, and a solid example of the style. I'll definitely be getting this again.","MrHurmateeowish","Jun 16, 2008"
4.25,4.4,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"I tried this at a beer tasting at a local store and had to buy a bottle. It's interesting, complex, and full of character. It is also quite young and certainly has not reached its full potential. This is a very good beer now, but in a couple years I can almost guarantee it will be outstanding. I am definitely going to have to buy a couple bottles to put down. I suggest anyone who comes across this buy at least two bottles, drink one now and lay the other down for a year or more. Highly recommended.","vtfan77","May 31, 2008"
