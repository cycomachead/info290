4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/10/2015. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, orange peel, lemon zest, light banana, wheat, pepper, clove, coriander, floral, herbal, grass, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of spice, malt, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear, apple, lemon zest, orange peel, grape, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, candi sugar, light honey, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, orange peel, lemon zest, light banana, clove, coriander, pepper, wheat, herbal, floral, candi sugar, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong ale! All around great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 04, 2013"

Smell is of grain, spices, Belgian yeast, and some slight citrus aromas. Taste is pretty much the same with the spices lingering on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

4.15,-1.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Southampton Grand Cru glides into the glass golden with a small tint of faded bronze within. a nice sheet of bright white up top, leaving a cap and small splotches. OK retention. Smell is fruity with a bready Belgian yeast with trace amounts of candi. No grassy scents, some hints of alcohol. Pretty bold in scent off the tap with a bit candi like scent than alot of American versions. Taste is up front with Belgian essence and a fruit. Apple, pear, small earthy hop bite in between with some candi sugar in the end that does not cloy. First sips give off some alcohol that warms the gullet. The 9.5% is not all the way hidden. Feel is a strong medium with a nice crisp carb. After half the glass this becomes all to easy to drink. A nice stab at the style and much better than alot of American versions out there. I just wish bottles were not so damn pricey, this would be a nice one to slide into 4 packs or so. Until then, I'll grab it on tap.","BARFLYB","Jan 09, 2012"

That is the only negative as it pours a cool, bright, caramel color. Scents of Belgian candy, sweet coriander, pepper. Taste is unique. A bunch of describable flavors hit the palate immediately followed by a sweet appley aftertaste. Almost like a cream soda.

A decent amount of candied seville oranges shine through, which is kind of becoming a staple of some Southampton brews I find. Nice, big, juicy flavors, but pretty sweet and just a thin mouthfeel. Some creaminess could really help this beer. More pleasant nuances begin to unfold toward the bottom of the bottle, as is custom with Southampton. Delightful floral notes play with the candied orange. Kind of reminiscent of the Cuvee des Fleurs when the yeast mixes in. Possibly a great one to cellar.","JAXSON","Aug 19, 2010"

The nose has a large presence of mandarin oranges, and other citrus components. Some yeasty character, and honey emerge as strong smells too. Big blast of honey up front from the taste, followed by a bit of that citrus, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is syrupy sweet, to the point that it almost reminds me of a mead. There is some carbonation there to help the drinkability, but the overall sweetness and thick body can make this one difficult to have a lot of.

After my first sip I was very disappointed I don't have any more of this. Appearance is a clear deep orange/amber with minimal sediment and a light tan/off white head that settles in as a thick crown and thin film with minimal lacing. Aroma is a delicate balance of orange peel, cream, vanilla, yeast and mild spiciness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescent carbonation resulting in an overall creamy, soft texture. Flavor is very sweet, complex and rich without being too cloying or unappealing. The sweet (ripe fruit, candied sugars, belgian yeast) and spice balance each other well. Drinkability is incredible, I went into this expecting another run of the mill BSPA, but ended up very impressed with this unique beer.","yourefragile","Feb 22, 2010"

Amber in color clouded by yeast after the initial pour, with an active carbonation. Smell is caramel malt, orange , vanilla, coriander, Belgian yeast esters, banana, and alcohol. Taste is full of sweet caramel malt with a slight roasted presence. Sophisticated bittering that balances the broad malt sweetness. Banana and clove like spiciness that evokes wiess without the wheat twang, then the coriander and light anise takes it somewhere deep in Belgium. Alcohol is well integrated but gives a fusel edge. Introducing the yeast tames it considerably. Light biscuit in the finish. Finish is long, dominated by the malt sweetness with the hops kissing it closed. Feel is medium weight with a carbonation that leans toward crisp and effervescent. A silky suppleness on the tongue.

The nose has a good amount of butterscotch and Belgian malts, acidic sour cherries and plenty of other fruity esters. The alcohol is evident as well. I wasn't too appetized by the scent, but as soon as this hit my tongue I quickly discovered a complex and tasty brew. The malts and fruits that seemed more separated in the nose come together very nicely with a moderate amount of sourness, creating tastes of dried cherries, rum raisins, candi sugar, and a plentiful amount of Belgian style flora and phenols. The finish is lightly cookielike with a hint of dried fruit, and ends drier than it would seem to. This is a full bodied beer with moderate to high levels of natural fine carbonation.

There is a balancing spice of coriander and light pepper. The sweetness is a blend of earthy Belgian tones, candied malt and hops that taste like wildflowers. Hats off to Southampton for this one.

The taste is sweet malts, apple, coriander, with a sherry like consistency, but it lacks some of the yeasty full bodiedness of a genuine Belgian, perhaps because the carbonation ran out. The beer is a bit syrupy, not entirely full bodied though. I knocked this beer down a few points because of the overly strong alcohol notes in the finish. This is a 9.5 ABV that tastes even stronger. I tend to appreciate when the throaty alcohol notes are more subdued or hidden behind complex tastes. Not so here.

4.87,15.4,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"At the time of this review, the Grand Cru is the #1 rated Belgian strong pale, and I can see why. This is an awesome concoction, brewed with orange peel, star anise, and coriander. 750 ml cork-n-crown bottle with no freshness date, and labeled as 9.8 %. The beer pours a sedimented radiant orange hue, with very active carbonation and three inches of fluffy, off-white head that puts loads of lacing on my tulip glass. It has an irresistible, sugary sweet bouquet, fruity and peppery, with oranges, pears, and yeast - I can't stop sniffing this beer. The flavors are even better, contributing orange, peppery coriander, hints of licorice, fruits (pear?, melon?, kumquat? stone fruits?), a mild to medium bitterness and the slightest hint of alcohol. Even the mouthfeel is complex - the medium and smooth, yet prickly body imparts coating citrus flavors that last long into the finish. Final thoughts? Powerful aromas and flavors, along with skilled brewing and delicious spicing combine to provide a unique, damn tasty Belgian that almost comes across as a big, meaty tripel, but goes down so very easily. It's beers like this that prove that America has some of the best brewers on the planet.","mmmbeer","Feb 10, 2008"

The aromas are nicely balanced with candi sugar up front, followed by banana, a hint of clove, and orange zest. The flavors are awesomely balanced and there is quite a bit going on in the glass. Flavors of sweet cani sugar, clove, banana, coriander, sultanas, orange, cream, star anise, and the tiniest hit of peppery spice at the end all intermingle seamlessly. Really beautiful flavors.

Wow!, as you take first sip you quickly come to realize this is a very complex brew. A wonderful mix of flavors attack the palate with sweet ripe mellon, robust spicey wheat, and hints of banana and back round hops. Coean and crisp while being bold and intriguing.

4.13,-2.1,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Pours honey orange in color, slightly hazy with a good size white head that recedes slowly and laces fairly heavily. Aroma is strong of coriander, behind this there is a delicate sweetness, like a fresh cream that mixes with the orange is reminiscent of an orange push-up. Taste follows the aroma with a strong and lingering coriander presence with a nice subtle creamy sweetness to balance it. Honey and oranges. There is some alcohol and a burnt rubber bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel shows some spiciness in the finish although it is quite smooth and soft thru the beginning and middle. The alcohol is fairly well hidden for nearly 10% but warms and bites just the right amount in the finish. Very much like a strong belgian wit, easy to drink a 750 even at this strength I keep coming back for more. Spices are well balanced by the soft sweetness, mouthfeel is outstanding.","hoppymeal","Nov 25, 2006"

Aroma of orange is quite intense with something sweet that didnt mix very well with the beer. Taste is like a mix between an orange crush and an average Belgian ale and was not really what I expected from this beer. The flavour doesnt really mix well and body was quite thin. I was expecting to be impressed by this beer based on previous rating but I am now wondering if I totally missed something or if this was a bad bottle.

Sweet, fruity aroma with distinctive clove spiciness. Maybe a bit of pepper and anise. Sweetness in the flavour really brings out the spiciness - coriander and anise are prominent. There's a light orange citrus quality as well. Light alcohol and warmth in the off-dry finish. Full bodied with carbonation on the light side, making it seem a bit heavy. Very nice.

Smells citrusy, zesty, and some definite spicyness in there. Very Hennepin-like. Taste is also citrusy and bready, and again spicy. Too spicy. Overload of corriander and black pepper, just way too much. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, and thin. For the alcohol content, it's pretty sneaky, but it's too sweet and way too spiced up.

The nose is candied orange, wheat, grass, lemon peel, honey, tartness, fresh spicy hop aroma that is elegant and delightful. The taste starts malty, candy fruit, citrus rind bitterness that is rounded out by a clean palate cleansing from the carbonation. The finish is bitter and slightly boozy but that alcohal is smooth a little rough but it is quickly offset by the fruit backbone making this is a phenominal ale one of the best I've had the pleasure of having.","Franchise","Jul 27, 2006"

4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml corked bottle. The beer is an effervescent and slightly cloudy light-orange colored brew. Topped with a thick and puffy white head, this is a brilliantly attractive brew (the lacing is incredible). The aroma is of citrus, spice, and yeast. Theres a fresh bread quality thats expanded on by orange and coriander. I also swear that I can smell honey, apples, and some funky yeasty wildness. The taste is equally as intriguing. It starts with a light sweetness, followed immediately by a pleasant alcohol warming and the spice complexity. Theres a quiet caramel and roasted grain flavor that also creeps into the taste that seemed to be missing from the aroma. Nice spritzy carbonation. At first, because of the carbonation and aroma, the beer gives the sensation of lightness, in fact, this is a quite full bodied brew. It dries out by the finish, which is flavorful and long lasting. Wonderful.","Suds","Jul 17, 2006"

This beer has a certain richness to it (in both the sweetness and the earthy spiciness) that is quite nice and fulfilling. There is a hint of tartness to this beer, and if there is one complaint it is that this beer could use a bit more tartness; the level provided by some aged Fantome's would be classic.

After the cork comes out with a little persuasion, this beer pours a hazy brown/prange color, head is very small, but good retention. The smell only reflects what the flavor confirms, that this beer needs age. The orange peel and spice give this beer a (although not unpleasent) sour orange juice flavor.

The fact that it is so sweet, combined with a light body with no carbonation is kind of aggravating. It's good, and gets better as it warms, but still. I thought Stonecrusher's review was perfect when he said that this is definitely a complex beer with a bunch of flavor, but none of them really all that delicous.

Each sip is packed with flavor, so although one could certainly down this as you would your run-of-the-mill pale ale, theres certainly no good reason not to sip this as you would any big beer.

Flavor starts off with fruity apples with a backing of spiciness, some coriander and orange peel I believe. Notes of other fruits are present. Its a bit sweet and tart but never too much of either. The fruit and spice carry the flavor nicely. Body is medium effervescent, crisp and refreshing. I can hardly believe this is 9.5 this drinks like a much lighter beer and is so damn enjoyable.

Great smelling and so pretty in the glass.The taste is out of this world. I've never been to belgium, but this fits the picture in my mind of what a "real" belgian beer should taste like if the monks brought it down to me personally. The lightest most delicate malt taste passes over your tounge, followed by a slightly tart citrus wave of lemon and orange. Finishes slightly dry without the slightest hint of alcohol. However, my head knows it's there. Mouthfeel is moderate and in perfect proportion with the flavors of this beer. You could drink a lot of this and get in heaps of trouble fast. This is a must drink.

4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Light copper with a good head. The aroma is slightly tart with a hint of bandaids. This is also a pretty herbal and earthy aroma. The slight tartness continues into the flavor along with a good bit of citrus fruit and peach turning the bandaids into something pleasant when its hard to imagine them being such.","aracauna","Jun 03, 2004"
5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall: My favorite beer from Southampton, bar none (which is saying a lot, as these guys keep cranking out the quality brews). This sets the standard for the style. I feel it is the equivalent to a California (or Long Island, as it were!) sparkling wine outclassing anything from the actual Champagne region of France. Hard for me to rate a beer perfect, but","bultrey","May 26, 2004"

4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2004. This is a real Belgian with lots of intricate and definitive spiciness--orange, corriander, even anise--but unlike most of the strong ales, there something understated about this superb, delicate brew. It pours a dark, slightly cloudy gold with a fine sticky lace. The aroma is sweet and piney, and the taste is exquisitely balanced. The carbonation is smoothly thin and perfectly appropriate for the mediummothfeel. This is one lovely offering, but note: very potent though you would not notice it right off the bat.","longpondbeerman","May 01, 2004"
4.43,5,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Appearnace is a basic golden amber color, with a good head that leaves patchy lace and a very even top after receding. Smell is very interesting. The main smell is a cross between rubber and fresh cut live wood. There's also a small grapy smell, and some hop hints. Taste is quite sweet, but it mellows so quickly that beyond the first bit of sweet, it is quite good. Its a thick taste probably because its got so much alcohol, with some fruity tastes, but they seem dulled down by a meaty salty taste too, interstingly. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, but medium in body. This is quite a good beer.","FranklinPCombs","Apr 19, 2004"
4.6,9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"This stuff is a monumental acheivement in brewing. Pours a serious shade of golden amber, shimmers and quakes with strength and vitality. A strong surge of flavor, boldness and complexity greats the tongue. No doubt about the quality of this lordly creation. Went great with a crab cake. This is a powerful sipper. Seek this one out and savor.","Billolick","Jan 03, 2004"
4.8,13.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Nice looking copper appearance capped with a thick, frothy dirty white head. Retention is outstanding. Lacing is moderate and droopy in form. CO2 bubbles stream to the surface at a moderate to somewhat quick pace. Nice nose of sweet orange, must, bready yeast, dry corriander and hayfields. The taste follows through with the breadiness and sweet orange. But there's also a great spiciness to the flavor. Alcohol spiciness. Black pepper spiciness. Corriander-like spiciness. Alcohol is apparant, but incorporated nicely into the overall structure of this beer. This beer has the type of bready, yeasty flavor that I love in Belgian style beers. Oh yeah, this one's nice.","Bighuge","Nov 19, 2003"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A strong ale of nice design. If again, I would age this beer less to aid its pungent array of possible complexities. Regardless, this drank like a sweet, citrus, and simple pleaser. Hard pressed to think of many better ales similar to it.","nomad","Oct 27, 2003"
4.25,0.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"This is a gorgeous beer. Thanks to herbjones for sharing. I thorooughly enjoyed this beer. Opaque golden color, sweet aroma with a complex fruity flavors on the tongue. In my opinion, it was absolutely a phenomenally well made brew. It was luxurious. You could sit back and enjoy it for a long time.","jcalabre","Sep 26, 2003"
4.77,13,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Incredibly drinkable and well worth seeking out. Call in your favors and get your hands on a bottle, but do not share it, savor it all yourself!","cretemixer","Sep 02, 2003"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This wonderful beer was a lovely clear golden colour, with a fluffy, big, white head. The aromas were sweet and consited of belgian candi sugar, yeast, various types of roasted malts, some very, very, background hops, fruit, spices, and more! The taste was a wonderful melange of spicy fruit flavors, as well as a tiny bit of alcohol flavor, malty goodness, and yeasty abandonment. The mouthfeel was very fine, with tiny bubbles gripping to the surface of my tongue, taking each and every taste-bud on a magical carpet-ride to never-never land! The drinkability is excellent for a grand cru, and many other breweries could learn a thing or two from this brewery that is churning out such drinkable versions of very hard-to-perfect styles. The East Coast Alesmith perhaps? I'll have to try some more of their brews to know for sure. But for now, I am glad that I am not a "virgin" of Phil Markowskis brews anymore!","francisweizen","Aug 23, 2003"
4.85,14.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"It's a peachy golden nectar with a heavy, creamy head. The aroma of applesauce, spicy yeasts, vanilla, and an abundance of other spices. The flavor follows along with an incredible sweet fruit flavor (peaches,pears) spicy yeast and marshmellows. It's a verrry drinkable medium body with nice carbonation. The flavors are hard to put to words but this beer is not hard to put to mouth. My rec is go get this beer and let it do it's magic.","jeffboo","Aug 18, 2003"
4.85,14.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"A most impressive brew! Its lush flavors are delivered within a perfect mouthfeel. Extremely well done. and absolutely worth seeking out! This beer rivals some of the top Belgain ales!","NeroFiddled","Beers"
4.88,15.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"I have yet to be disappointed by any Phil Markowski brew. I wish we all had access to his brews!!","rotsaruch","0"
4.8,13.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall this was a wonderful find and well worth the nearly $10 for the bottle. My friend Geoff who does not like most of the beers I tried said he would drink this all day long. A ringing endorsment in my world. This is by far the easiest drinking high ABV beer I have come across and this solidifies my love for the Grand Cru style. I am immediatly going to go back and buy a couple more and cellar them for the Rochester winter.","GreatPondBrewer","0"
