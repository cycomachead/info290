Taste is like the nose yeasty with lots of fruit, banana, candy apple sweetness balanced by a light bitterness, a bit of spice in the finish, well balanced and quite nice. Medium carbonation, full-medium body. Solid stuff here, a nice belgian pale ale that drinks fairly easy, could see myself having this again.","peensteen","May 26, 2014"

3.75,-4.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a dark rich honey amber that almost grades into russet, with ample billowing Duvel style foam. One is immediately struck by the strong yeasty esters, phenols, fruit, brown spices, and bready malt aromas, and the taste is even more complex. I get quite a lot of banana, which combines with crystal malt sweetness to yield a banana bread effect, cinnamon and nutmeg, cloves, a more fragrant noble hop perfume, some apple, a whole ton of yeast really. A yeast forward beer that veers into cloying at times, whereas Duvel stays fruity and crisp. The finish is dry, reasonably bitter, and very earthy, calls to mind ginseng or even fresh potatoes or other root vegetables. You've got several takes on spice all vying together and I can't say the whole thing is as balanced as maybe it should be, but it ain't dull. There are medicinal notes and almost a fermented honey vibe like mead. Sweetness and earthy bitterness linger for a long time and I get some overly ripe tropical fruit and grassy green hops. Fairly bubbly but less assertive carbonation than I was expecting, which is fine in terms of letting the nuances shine forth. I laud the complexity even as I wonder if the finish is overly variegated and dank. Unibroue does not produce a bad beer. This one is very good but not a world beater (cf. their dark ale and tripel offerings).","CalgaryFMC","Sep 04, 2013"

Some small bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, raisins, apple, grape, and spicy yeast. Some nice aromas with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, molasses, biscuit, citrus, grass, and spiciness. Initial taste in the front tastes just like dulce de leche, very unique stuff. No bitterness noticed; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium body and fairly high carbonation; with a creamy mouthfeel with big prickly carbonation as expected for a bottle conditioned brew. No alcohol noticed except for a slight warming after the finish. Very nice drinkability with great balance of flavors. Overall, a very interesting and excellent Belgian ale.

Tastes of dark pit fruits, in contrast to the nose of the lighter tropical fruits. Dark plum and prune, with pear running up the back. Solid spicing and hopping balance the fruity sweetness. Creamy and dangerously drinkable. Excellent.","mrmanning","Jul 07, 2009"

Poured a hazy burnt orange with a three inch off-white head that fizzed and popped as it slowly receded into a solid, quarter inch cap; some slashes of lacing, but somewhat weak legs. Candi sugar and light fruit (perhaps tangerine and apricot) dominate the nose. Taste is consistent with nose and finishes somewhat dry. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly - a little too much carbonation, and the sensation follows from start to finish; consistency fell between light- and medium-bodied. Nice Belgian Pale. A solid B+ in my book; however, could have been an A- if it was a little less effervescent.","Jwale73","Jun 06, 2009"

Big thick head that had nice retention, left a fair amount of lacing though I thought there would be more? The aroma is very nice , normal Unibroue yeast aroma comes to mind at first. Fruit is there as well as a nice but subtle spice. Very inviting aroma! The taste, while good, just did not seem to be there for me. The spice comes out more here, I seem to notice that first, clove. Also present is the yeast which seems to give a slight fruit like ester, apple, at least that is where I think it is coming from. Slight sweetness that reminds me sightly of brown sugar.

The head is bright white, rises quickly and falls slowly leaving a persistent collar of foam. The color is a hazy-orange. La Seigneuriale smells good, with a sort of apricot-butterscotch-toffee aroma (heavy on the apricot). The aroma is most certainly devoid of hops. Toffee and caramel flavors are tasted. This beer is very smooth and sweet with some fruity-apricot esters. It finishes sweet; just dry enough to not be cloying. This is a beer for malt heads and those who appreciate estery ales. The potency is also more than the 7.5 percent alcohol would suggest. One 750-ml bottle is certainly more than enough for one person.","marcobrau","Jul 21, 2007"

It has a semi-cloudy body that is a deep amber-orange color. Moderate-to-vigorous carbonation. The taste is full of complexity and flavor. Rich with berries and fruit, moderately apparent alcohol ester-ish taste, and a tart ending. The aftertaste has figs, bananas, and a tongue tingling alcohol burn. The mouthfeel would have had a 4.0 if it hadn't had such a burn to it. The La Fin, and the Don both have more alcohol and little-to-no burn. Maybe a cellaring is due?

On the palate, a bit of a harsh note comes through where there should be softness. Pale malts, minor fruitiness at the front, then rising hop bitterness at the middle and into the finish. Smooth phenols come out at the finish as well. Mouthfeel has some bracing bitterness and plenty of acidity, along with a bigger body than I expected from the style.

Finishes dryly with a good sense of bitter at the close. The end is more interesting than the beginning, overall, slightly overcarbonated to my tastes.","ADR","Oct 26, 2006"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"To the beer I can't pronounce with diction or cognition...It appears a cloudy amber brown deep copper tone with a loarge off white beige head forming large bubbles it leaves nice full even bands of lacing between ech sip. Aromatics contain heavility spiced layers with heavy clove and citrus peel notes as well as a real herbal tea like note bringing floral notes with sweet spicy christmas bread notes quite lively overall Unibroue always impresses. Flavor has evident alcohol along with full on spice tones really clovey with raisinand spice bread notes evident yeasty profile and leafy eathy rustic tone. The Mouthfeel is medium bodie ale with effervescent carbonation while the spices last long and thick on the palates surface. Drinkability is decent althought I feel this would greatly improve with a bit of age on each bottle...I love Unibroue even here after the original takeover years.","WVbeergeek","Oct 23, 2006"
3.92,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a cloudy reddish amber color with a huge frothy head. Aroma was very spicy: clove, pepper, anise and possibly cinammon in the nose. Taste was also very spicy, but with quite a bit of fruit mixed in. Tropical fruit(mango), banana and raisin bready flavors along with a light to medium bodied mouthfeel make for an easy drinking experience. Alcohol was not evident in aroma or taste. This is a pretty interesting offering from Unibroue, but it's definitely not a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. It reminds me more of a dunkelweizen or even a weizenbock. Oh well, Belgian style beers never go by the book anyway.","rodrot","Oct 18, 2006"

4.38,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Enjoyed last night at Pazzos with the owner, a Unibroue representative, and some great beer enthusiasts. This is another impressive brew from Unibroue. Naturally, very Belgian, and with some impressive Wit-like softness. Strong pale and wheat malts and that classic twangy Belgian yeast. Very fruity (peaches, pears, appricots, mangos), estery (clove, bananna, papaya), and spicy (pepper, corriander, orange peel). Less hot and fusal as Unibroue beers usually get, rather very soft, abundantly carbonated, and smooth. Very dry in the finish with a clean fruity quality. Thanks Karl.","BEERchitect","Sep 27, 2006"

Yeasty nose. Starts almost sweet with a spicey yeast flavor, hints of sourness at finish. $6.49 for a 750ml bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH. Best by 07-31-09","jdhilt","Sep 25, 2006"
3.93,0.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"750 ml bottle. The brew is an oranged tea color. Two fingers of very light tan head falls to around a finger, with tons of chunky lace clinging to the sides of the glass. The brew is very hazy, and the carbonaion is moderate. Aroma is a little light. There are nice spicey yeast qualities, with a subtle banana estery undetone with candied sugar sweet tones, but it all seems a little distant. I will see how it comes through with more time to warm. The flavor is interesting. The notes from the aroma are all there, with a nice alcohol spiceyness that really adds a nice dimension. The banana fruityness blends with a nice raisiney fruityness to really give a nice flavor. There is a nice very mild bitterness on the finish from noble hop. Lots going on there, but it is also a little muted just like the aroma. Mouthfeel is light with a very strong carbonation. This one has a really nice light feel for a pretty strong brew. Overall, I like this one. Even though the aroma and flavor are muted, it still conveys a good deal of complexity.","kmpitz2","Sep 21, 2006"
4.47,14.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I drank a lot of Unibroue in last six months and never saw this until recently, so naturally I had to give it a try. Poured into to my Chimay chalice a musty reddish amber hue with high lights from beneath. The head was nice and white, leaving wave like lacing all the way down. Smelt of warm bread, nice fruit esters, predominantly banana and grapefruit maybe even hints of apple, some spice and Belgian yeast. Tasted so smooth on the tongue, velvety, with hints of malt, a nice musty thickness, wonderful fruit and spice pallet, some caramel and toffee notes, with a tinge of alcohol warmth only felt residually, but completely hidden other wise. Definitely a Belgian style brew, I might even call this more of a tripel then a BSPA, this is good stuff, thanks again Unibroue.","mmcave","Sep 18, 2006"

3.11,-20.5,3,4.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Slightly cloudy, light orange/amber colour with a rocky, light beige head. The foam quickly dissipated and didn't leave anything behind on the sides of the glass. Smells of alcohol, bubblegum, light pineapple, spices (clove, nutmeg, maybe cinnamon), and vanilla. Very nice. First taste... What the hell happened? A thin, candy sweetness kicks things off and is followed by an overbearing, bitter spiciness that lingers on the palate. Fortunately, a bit of bready, yeasty flavour appears towards the end. Some fruit character is present, but isn't enough to balance out the harshness. Decent texture, medium bodied, slight slickness. But what happened to the flavour? What a surprise after sampling the delightful and complex aroma.","DrJay","Jan 20, 2006"

Nicely hopped - good balance, however on the sweet side of the scale. Medium mouthfeel.This was a bottle of the Retired version. Had the new version and it was more yeast and metallic, maybe would get the same rating but not as tasty.","Sammy","Dec 29, 2005"

Taste is sweet up front, some citrus and yeast, little bit of spice, really heavy on the alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, little bit syrupy and medium carbonation. Not bad but can definately see the Unibroue slide in recent times.","Viggo","Dec 21, 2005"
3.92,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Light orange in colour with strong carbonation. Fantastic aromas of bready malts, pears, and spicy Belgian yeast. Both caramel and bready malts make an appearance in the mouth, along with more complex fruit flavors (apple, pear, peach, and orange). Some black pepper also becomes apparent near the finish, along with some drying earthy funk. Great stuff.","fisherman34","Oct 11, 2005"

3.4,-13,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"A Unibroue beer which is not too widely available, even here in Canada. Thanks to Duncan for sending me one through CANBIF. This comes like most other Unibroues in the caged and corked 750ml, and the label is another beauty for sure. Very pastoral and bucolic, showing an estate beside trees and the lake in the background. La Seigneuriale poured with high carbonation after uncorking, and the off-white head fizzed rapidly until little was left on top. No lacing to speak of. The beer's colour is hazy tangerine, almost light strawberry in some light. The aroma is pretty typically Unibroue in style, with a nice fruitiness, yeasty dryness, some apple and citrus, and a generous amount of malting. A lot of apple, and some tanginess along with cork or wood. Nothing out of the ordinary for Unibroue. The taste is light, giving some malts up front, dusty yeast in the middle, and a minty taste at the back. Wood tastes are also quite strong. The beer is spritzy on the tongue, making it a little champagne-like. Medium bodied and a little too dusty feeling in the mouth for my taste. This beer does not have lot of complexity for Unibroue, and it would not be a regular purchase of mine. It paired very well with Gouda cheese.","Cwrw","Beers"

3.55,-9.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: It is a ok beer and very typical of current Unibroue products. Maybe, they should take more risks and try some more innovative.

3.79,-3.1,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste: The palate feels like a split between a Maudite and either a Hefeweizen or a wit, almost as if they diluted a batch of Maudite with a little Blanche de Chambly. So it had wheaty and spicy to start off, then a little bread and an alcoholic finish. Fans of Unibroue will enjoy, those who think the recipies are getting a little redundant will add another arrow to thier quivers.","Goldorak","0"
