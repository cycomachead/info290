3.93,5.9,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Sour Brettanomyces driven first impression, coated up by bready, soft malts. Also ripe, fruity orange, which goes well with the sourness. Then dry, noble hops hit the palate, which give the beer a well balanced, decent complexity. Sweet molasse becomes detectable for a glance, which soon gets swallowed by the hoppy sourness. This actually reminds me of Orval in some way, but adds a very well fitting fruit note to the beer, while it isn’t very aggressive on the hops. Leads to a bitter finish, very dry aftertaste, which dries up the mouth completely.","aleigator","Jan 17, 2015"

3.77,1.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"still great beer here, but unfortunately i think i enjoy the many variations far more than the original here. this is more of a belgian than the others, and as such the brett comes through a lot less. the ak alive version i thought was the supreme wild ale, a perfect example of dryness and brett character, while its alive here is just a bit more generic as they go. hazy rust colored liquid, maybe a touch lighter than that, with a prominent several inches of cream colored fluff. it smells like belgian yeast first, orchard fruit esters and dusty grain ith some amber malt sweetness. the brett is really only on the finish for me, not super dry or effervescent, but farmy, more like a belgian saison here than a true wild ale as i have come to know them from mikkeller, but i like it a lot just the same. the brett pushes the denser grain to the forefront of the flavor, where its sweetness is balanced nicely. the diversity of yeasts and yeast characters make this beer unique and special, but i just dont find the complexity or wonderment i discovered in all the variations of it. great carbonation and a lof of body still. very well made beer, but i would take ak alive over this one any day.","StonedTrippin","Mar 07, 2014"

Aroma is a funky butterscotch, toffee, earthy. Really great smell. Taste is more funky than the aroma; but otherwise follows the smell. Great carbonation lends to the bubbly mouthfeel.

4.06,9.4,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Copper colored ale slightly hazed with yeast sediment big chunky off white khaki head leaves fine Belgian style lacing, great look to it. Aromatics tart funky yeast notes acidophilus, brettanomyces, the gangs all here...It's Alive! The beer's yeast that is. Great barnyard funky edge to it, acidic hints of yogurt borderline vinegar lactic acid notes, this beer was aged on white wine barrels. I'm not sure what they were going for but I like sour ales. On the second sniff I'm getting ripened pineapple, oak barrel aging effects, a slight buttery note, there's everything in here. Flavor wise, bitter yeast and acidity collide, a hint of band aid, medicinal notes, with big fruit thing ripened pineapple, tropical fruit notes embedded in barnyard/horse blanket type flavor aspects, grassy hay and wet acidity. Some people would say cat piss but I don't find it offensive in the least regards. I find hints of sliced green apple, plump raisins, and other fine infused tart characteristics, this is probably my favorite Mikkeller thus far, I find hit or miss to be their game but this is dead on for a beer called...It's Alive! I'm a fan, of their de Proef gypsy brewed offerings I've had limited contact with their hoppy ales but have found them to be lackluster compared to most American brewed versions. Mouthfeel upfront has a rolling carbonation a bit prickly with acidity and sharp dry finish but the mix of carbonation and dry character seems to treat the beer superbly on the palate. Overall what can I say that I didn't already go try this brew.","WVbeergeek","Nov 16, 2013"

Pours hazy reddish orange color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of oak, raisin, red wine, pear, caramel, apple, wine vinegar, earth, grass, hay, herbal, pepper, leather, funk, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and high complexity. Taste of oak, raisin, pear, caramel, pepper, earth, hay, leather, molasses, grass, clove, funk, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of oak, dark fruit, caramel, molasses, pepper, earth, herbal, grass, leather, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavor; no cloying flavors at all after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is ok; definitely needs more carbonation. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian wild ale. The taste was a bit odd at first, but it grew on me; nicely complex and smooth to sip on. Enjoyed this quite a bit despite low carbonation.","superspak","Sep 28, 2012"

4.16,12.1,5,4,4,4,4.5,"750ml cellered for a good while Thanks to Gregus. Mikkeller is alway expensive, but pretty much alway unique and good. Clear amberish color, amazing looking head. Frothy and solid looking, like wax. I walked away for 20 minutes and came back to the head still holding like a champ, and lacing still clinging. This beer has great visual appeal. Smell is an appealing, but very delicate aroma. I smell flowers and bright acidic yeast. Not what I was expecting. Beer is surprisingly drinkable. Subtle malt notes, minimal hopping. Seems like the recipe is designed to push the yeast character, which is complex and exciting to the palate. Ph is low and puckers the lips a bit. Thin body, booze is quite well hidden. I could have used a bit more sour. But wonderful beer. Pleasure to have tried.","mlazzaro","Oct 13, 2011"

Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, orange rine, fruit, banana, and subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sugar, wheat, banana, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was just something about this one that was a little off-putting in the flavor. Maybe it was the way the sugar blended with the fruits present??? Who knows, but this could have been a lot better if this were not the case. Glad I got to try it, but that is about it.","thagr81us","Sep 07, 2011"

4.03,8.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"So, I have no idea where to write this review. I found this bottle just recently, but it is in a 750ml bottle and labeled as a Belgian Wild Ale. I thought it may be the It's Alive that is not retired, but the ABV is off and there are no 750ml bottle reviews...so I'm VERY CONFUSED. So anyways, pours an almost-clear golden amber color with a HUGE, beautiful, frothy cream-colored head. Scent is a bit of Brett with some sugary sweetness to it. Lots of pepper and spiciness to it with a hint of lemon zest and citrus...orange peel. Taste is initially citrusy with hints of funk from the Brett. Not as funky as I was expecting. Has a lot of Belgian yeast flavors and sugar cane. Then I some lemon tartness that finishes sweet and Bretty. Mouthfeel is full and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome beer. I can definitely see how people would compare this beer to Orval, but IMO it can't compete. In fact, any beer that is a tribute to Orval can't compare...this one may be the closest though.","DovaliHops","Beers"

The nose has bright sour citrus, red fruit, a touch of pleasant funk along with belgian spices. The taste brings sour raspberry, lemon, along with clove and almost a touch of banana, very light sourness and funk - tasty stuff.

Retains nice lacing throughout however. Picking up some funky aroma, bread, grapes, oak, and floral notes. Light vinious. High, prickly carbonation, fine dry and mild creamy mouthfeel.

It could be more tart, it could bolder, it could be more fruity, it could be more sour. I would guess I'd rate this an A- if fresh, but right now I can't do it. Some sours get stronger with age, this one lessens. It's tart but not tart enough. It drinks smoothly enough but it's not what it could be. It's drinkable but not overly so.

Very yeasty, fruity taste. Unsweetend apple sauce and caramel malts. The apples and caramel slowly move to a smokey toasted malt. Hints of Tandy leather give an earthy hop finish.
