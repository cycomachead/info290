Banana and citrus undertones. Crisp biscuit and cloves on the nose. Transitions to lagered hops, malted cream, and some bitter cinnamon. On the back palate a bit of pepper, warm spice, some more skunky hops, and little clove. Crisp citrus aftertaste, a little skunky hops, and some cinnamon. Very complex flavor profile.

Hefty yeast aromas of fruity esters, clove, and peppercorns along with a pale malt sweetness, herbs, and a little bubblegum.  Yeasty flavor as well, starting off a little more rustic, before settling into dried fruit, citrus, phenolics, and spices.    There's more bite to the taste overall, but a sweetness from the malts helps round it out.  Despite the high ABV, the feel stays fairly crisp and drinkable, drying out into the finish.  Smooth and leaning towards full bodied.  Not tremendously complex or anything, but well crafted.","wedge","Feb 26, 2015"

4.49,9.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: A truly impressive Belgian style offering that for the most part is Belgian (by ownership) but brewed in America. It ranks right up there with the best. If the sweetness was dropped a slight bit it might even be confused for some of the finest Belgians, but then it wouldn't be very unique. Interesting, completely satisfying, and almost compellingly drinkable - worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Jan 15, 2015"

Smell: sugar cookie, spicy and mildly herbal hopping, fruity - pear, grape and white peach. Taste: sugary pear, mildly spicy, sugar cookie, white grape juice, bubblegum note, then peach skin finish. Fairly full bodied, carbonation is dialed in to almost hit that velvety feel. In the end a little sweet, but really tasty.

I am a fan of the Ommegang brewery and I like le Chouffe so when I saw the le Chouffe gmomes dancing on an Omegong bottle, I had to try it.  This is a sweet blonde ale with some great spicing.

Also feeling that the hop content was not harmonious with a belgian yeast profile.  I see a contradiction in thought process here.  To say that the beers harmony is compromised by the hop profile, demonstrates some palate savvy, along with the ability to produce an articulate insight.  A very useful quality.  However, to say that it's too hoppy for their liking, leads me to believe that they are part of the Shock Top crowd, thus should not be rating a beer like this.  Consequently, they shouldn't be indoctrinating themselves into craft beer by drinking Gnomegang.  Rather, they should start with something like Yuengling, or however the heck you spell it.  Gnomegang is not hop forward, not by any stretch.   Drink seltzer.","mirp1","Dec 25, 2014"

Obviously, the latter was not the case here as I could feel the booze kicking in by the time I finished this bottle off. I have to admit that many of Ommegang's beers start to taste the same to me after a while but when they're good enough to be mistaken with something imported, who cares? I don't and this was another great example of why I love these guys so much. A hint of spice combined with Belgian fruity flavors and the perceived absence of alcohol combined for a beer that I'll reach for again, even if I don't consider it to be a categorical anomaly.

I could not taste what was going on with it. Not balanced at all but very complex and left a sweet bitter after taste. You could taste nothing but the cloves.

4.42,7.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 1/23/2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, candi sugar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt balance. Taste of big lemon, apple, pear, grape, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, and floral on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters; with a great malt/spice flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong pale ale! Huge balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with light-moderate malt sweetness; and dangerously smooth and crisp to sip on for 9.5%. An insanely delicious offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2013"

It has a grain note but is primarily dominated by the yeast which is fruity with hint of clove. After it gets some time to oxidize you can smell some faint peppery, herbal hop aromas. The flavor is very malty with the taste of grains, but with an infusion of rather spicy yeast. It is rather sweet, but not overpoweringly so.","SeamusDoyle","Jan 14, 2013"

At its high points, it showcases the Chouffe and Ommegang strains in a way that they complement one another. You can actually tell them apart in some ways, but they meet at certain points, too, particularly in the tart, lemony character. This is without a doubt one of my favorite American-made Belgian-style beers, and I’m going to look forward to this from Ommegang in the future, as well.","fmccormi","Jan 09, 2013"

This imparted a genuine Belgian feel and flavor, as is seen with most of Ommegang’s offerings. The high abv, overt fumy booze, and warming qualities kept things interesting. Where we lost points was in the sweetness of the flavoring, which became a bit cloying by the end, and cut the pale and inherent drinkability of the style. Otherwise things were tasty, and we’ll be happy to see what another few months does to this guy.","TheBrewo","Dec 06, 2012"

A bit too bad about its pricey intro to these parts, but I'll say it: totally worth it.

Smell is fruity with a bready Belgian yeast with trace amounts of candi. No grassy scents, some hints of alcohol. Pretty bold in scent off the tap with a bit candi like scent than alot of American versions. Taste is up front with Belgian essence and a fruit. Apple, pear, small earthy hop bite in between with some candi sugar in the end that does not cloy. First sips give off some alcohol that warms the gullet. The 9.5% is not all the way hidden. Feel is a strong medium with a nice crisp carb. After half the glass this becomes all to easy to drink. A nice stab at the style and much better than alot of American versions out there.

Color is a slightly hazy yellow amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, apricot, malt, fruit, caramel. Flavor's like nose, has some dominant sweetness, yet also has some persistant bitterness on the back of the tongue, a little carbonic tang. Body is good; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, fairly long and only a little alcohol warmth. On one hand the beer is almost too sweet, yet on the other it isn't. A little rich to have another though.","drpimento","May 24, 2012"

It pours an unmiraculous dull gold with a thin pfft of white foam on top. Despite the insipid appearance, the flavor is quite nice. Bushels of tropical fruit fill out the body - mango, banana, bitter melon, kiwi, and papaya. Mild bitterness lets a sweet, bready malt backbone come out. Little in the way of hop bitterness, flavor, or aroma - the yeast does the talking in this ale. A little more carbonation and dryness would go a along way here, but the flavors are really pleasant.","bump8628","May 09, 2012"

Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like green apples, bready malt, hay, pears, and a bit of clove and tropical fruit. It tastes like grass/hay, earth, cloves, peppery spice, pears, bready malt/grain, and some apples. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and has a good amount of carbonation.

Typical cloudy orange for a Belgian blonde pour with a half inch of fluffy head that reduces down to white lace around the inside of the glass. Smells of yeast, orange peel and raisin and a fair amount of sweetness. Taste is very good on the tongue flavors of the aforementioned with a nice little bite from the alcohol. Had this one and was saving it for my Thanksgiving Day beer with the meal and it did not disappoint, very solid and very drinkable though the 9.5% abv eventually caught up to me in the end. However, the abv was in no way overwhelming to the beer in taste or feel, just a good creeper that's great for a cold night to keep you warm and toasty on the inside. My 1st from Ommegang, I have a Rare Vos chilling as well that I plan to crack soon. The LaChouffe gnome caught my eye and I had to try...now I'm craving La Chouffe.","Blueribbon666","Nov 25, 2011"

3.88,-5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Purchased this as part of the Holiday gift pack. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a dull golden-orange with a slightly hazy clarity. Head is one inch, fluffy and bright white and embedded with pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a soapy slick and a tight white band around the shoulders. Thin swaths of lacing coat the walls of the glass. Nose expresses coriander, clove and a trace of candi sugar - overall impression is somewhat herbal. Taste consistent with nose; however a pleasant, light malt backbone reveals itself. There's also a suggestion of raisins and a hint of something else - perhaps mint, perhaps a residual tropical fruit quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, almost prickly carbonation, some acidity and a faintly oily texture. There's also a residual burn at the back of the throat that lingers between quaffs culminating in a slightly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid BSPA but there are better examples of the style out there. Well worth a try if the opportunity presents.","Jwale73","Nov 23, 2011"

The nose comprises loads of banana, wheat, very light cobweb, powdered sugar, and a few sprinkles of nutmeg. It's sweet, generally pleasant, and loaded with banana. The taste holds notes of banana peel, sharp orange rind, light lemon peel, sweet flowers, and light acetone. Man, this stuff really bites the tongue with bitterness! The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a decent brew, but the bitterness comes across as far too astringent for me, and to the partial detriment of the Belgian character, no less.

Taste is so close to perfect I may have to come back and p the score. It follows the nose but adds a peppery bite. A touch of sweet alcohol that melds into grains and cinnamon. Mildly spicy hop finish that features a bit of alcohol bit and citrus skin. Crispy dryness gives you a reason to go back to the glass way too soon.

The hops are such that they would probably be conducive to to the aging as well. I would venture to guess that this beer would be ready in about 18 months or so of cold aging. At that point, hopefully the yeast will settle and the hops and alcohol would co-exist a bit better to make this beer more drinkable.

Aroma, well its weak. A little spicy, a little banana, and a suggestion of belgian candi sugar. The taste is clean, crisp. There are flavors of clove, banana, and spicy belgian yeast. A very clean pils malt, not much in the way of hops. Very esters are present, some green apple too. To think this is almost 10%, can't be but it is. A really well crafted, but simple beer.

The sweetness starts things off, then it gets so nice and spicy in the middle that burns--but it burns like peppers, not like alcohol--and then that fades slowly away and leaves a taste of tangy honey upon your tongue, and the whole time the beer's as thick as silk.","mynie","Jun 07, 2011"

Aroma is spicy citric with hints of tropical fruit a very pleasant aromatic experience as a whole. Hints of pineapple and apricot very enticing with each sniff or use it as a reduction in your next sauce creation at home in the culinary kitchen.

With it comes fruit, funk and wet hay mixed with some sweet bready malt and solid notes of floral/spicy hops. It starts with a nice base of sweet bready malt and yeast with a light touch of funk and wet hay. Inside this are some nice fruity notes as well and I get white wine grapes, light unripe peach and mild orange blossom. This is all backed up by a firm floral and spicy hop bitterness that adds a pleasant balance and dryness to the finish. It’s well balanced on the palate and fun to drink.

4.12,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Lots of yeast character, as expected with anything Chouffe-related. I like the spicy complexity of the yeast as it works very well with the rich, bready malt character. There is some hop character, but not quite as much as it seems like there should be, especially considering how thick the malt character is. The finish is a bit of the sweet side for my taste however and this holds the beer back a bit. A very nice example of the style, though as far a Belgian-American collaborations go it is still second to the Green Flash/St. Feuillien strong golden ale.","nickfl","May 06, 2011"

Smell was floral and citrus-like, and reminded me a lot of a saison. Taste was very refreshing. Lots of notes of coriander, lemon and Belgian sugar. Mouthfeel was tart and crisp. A great beer for the style, with an abv that is well hidden. A bit pricey, but worth a try. Ommegang does not make many duds, and this one continues their winning ways.","morebeergood","Apr 25, 2011"

The body was also noticed to be more cloudy, and with a slightly darker shade of yellow, than the pale golden color that other BSPA's typically display. The smell was grassy, and floral, typical of the style. The taste was very lemony, with floral and spicy hop notes. The middle was dry, and the tartness lasted into the aftertaste. As the beer warmed up, some banana and tropical fruit flavors started to show up. This was not as funky as Hennepin, but was closer to that flavor profile than BSPA's like Duvel. Mouthfeel was a touch lighter than medium, and carbonation was soft and not overly aggressive. The alcohol was well hidden, and the warming finish surprising. A hybrid that tastes more like a cohesive whole.","rajendra82","Apr 24, 2011"

4.19,2.2,3.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Gnomegang pours a halfway cloudy tangerine, though it gets as light as lemon yellow depending on the lighting. The frothy white crown comes up to being three fingers tall. Head retention is just average for the style, and lacing is a bit short of top notch examples. The nose is a spot on blend of pears/granny smith apples, hebal and spicy hop notes, and more intense pepper and clove phenols. That balance gets lost on my palate though as a the phenolic/hop notes take over just a tad too much for the beer to be great. The hop bitterness is dialed in perfectly to mark the transition from fruity flavors to the other, and there's also just a hint of warmth from the alcohol that blends in nicely to the finish. The beer just finishes too phenolic and dry (even for a BSPA) for my taste. Given that, I'm pleasantly surprised by how superb the mouthfeel is. The body is light for such a potent beer, yet maintains enough of a backbone to stand up to all the flavors that make up the beer. At the same time the carbonation cuts through everything like a knife, without becoming obtrusive. The bubbles feel very small/fine and precise on my tongue, and as a result I don't think I'd change anything about the mouthfeel. A little bit more balance in the flavor department and Gnomegang would be world class, but as it is it's a very good beer.","axeman9182","Apr 16, 2011"

It was a beautiful bouquet of perfectly blended flavors. The spices, light hops, floral aspects, yeast, cloves and honey all blended so perfectly. I was blown away. It's probably the best tasting Belgian strong pale I've had since the first time I opened a Bruery Mischief, but better. It drank light and left a nice yeasty, spicy aftertaste.

I'm getting all kinds of balanced tastes such as breadiness and crisp carbonation and some bitter hops for dryness, and yet I'm also picking up fruit flavors that range from sour citric to grape to plush fruit like apple and pear and also sweetness from caramel, sugar and sweet fruit, plus a pickup from spices and the ABV is rather well hidden, though it combined w/ the spices bring a little hotness to the finish (nothing major).

4.35,6.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On-tap at Flying Saucer Raleigh during their 11th anniversary event. Served in a tulip glass a slightly hazy dark straw yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is floral hops, sweet malts and mild pepper. The taste is a nice amount of sweet fruits, earthy hops and spices such as lemon peel, pepper and coriander. The beer is quite light, crisp and smooth with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable, easy drinking Belgian strong pale, I look forward to trying more of this in the future!","atsprings","Feb 26, 2011"
