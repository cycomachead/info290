4.39,12.6,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Pours a murky golden with a tint of orange. Massive foamy head lingers for a long time. Sticky, thick and foamy lacing retains excellently, up to the top of the glass. The aroma is of sugars and fruity esters; there is an intense blend of tropical fruit. The taste starts out as predominantly fruity; the finish has tones of orange and sugar (like orange soda). Later, this finish becomes more dry and bitter with a hint of grapefruit and hops. The taste also becomes more complex; a yeasty flavor takes over as well as hops that balance the sweet tone. As for feel, this is a sipper. I consider it a medium to slightly full bodied beer, a modest carbonation but just right for a brew of this complexity. I enjoyed.","Gajo74","Jan 24, 2015"

4,2.6,,,,,,"When I saw that this was a Flemish wild ale, I expected some sour. However, the fact that there wasn't much was well offset by the other very strong characters present.  On my own, I don't identify profiles like "barnyard" or "straw," but those are admittedly exactly how this beer starts. The yeast combo gives both the banana and stone fruit. There is a touch of hop in the finish. Overall a solid brew, with the emphasis on the wild, not the "flemish."","MisterGone","Sep 06, 2014"

3.99,2.3,3.5,4.5,3.75,4,4,"Deep murky gold with all sorts of big, ugly floaties, yet a beautifully thick, rocky head of lumpy foam. Smell is tart and dry, focusing on a funky floral aroma, backed up by a nice pale malt sweetness, straw, lime, and champagne-like notes. More pale malt upfront than expected, the tart, funky qualities fall back alongside a more typical Belgian yeast profile before kicking into gear with spicy fruit, lemon, and flowers. Smooth and textured - almost chewy, in fact, before drying out in the finish. Not quite as good as I remember the Primitive Wild series being, though the fantastic aroma is still the best part.","wedge","Dec 29, 2013"

3.9,0,4,4,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; best before 11/1/2012(code L1101). Pours lightly hazy and cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, apple, peach, pear, apricot, pineapple, grape, floral, clove, black pepper, wood, grass, honey, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of tart apple, pear, apricot, lemon, peach, grape, clove, black pepper, floral, honey, bread, grass, wood, and earthy yeast spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, clove, black pepper, honey, bread, floral, grass, wood, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and earthy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice wild Belgian strong pale ale. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt sweetness; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable slow sipper.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

Aroma is filled with tart lemony notes, spicy floral hops and brett funkiness...a good blend of different things going on from the first sniff. Strong herbal/spicy yeast with leathery tannin notes coming off giving the beer an assertive bitterness. Some sweet biscuit malt breadiness with light honey and citric rind fruit notes blending together, amongst a spicy yeast and light herbal hop blend. The complexity builds as it warms, including more of an alcohol presence...I didn't initially notice that this beer weighed in at 9% abv. Texture is nice on the palate, a bit of bear when it comes to dryness but I think it compliments the wild yeast nutty/funky/leather characteristics. Effervescent carbonation tickles the nares with a couple of those sips, nothing too abrasive for me. Definitely a medium bodied complex beer all around, that I wouldn't go rushing out for I'm glad I tried a 11.5 ounce portion, satisfying but anymore of it I would have had enough after my single serving.","WVbeergeek","Apr 24, 2012"

Almost like a champagne. Overall this is a very good beer, the aroma and taste are well balanced and make you want another.","goblue3509","Oct 23, 2011"

Although I was hoping this beer was really sour, I am definitely not disappointed in the taste. Initially I get the apple fruitiness, followed by some hay and brett flavor (I happen to be a fan of brett). Then the hops dominate to leave you with a crisp, dry, lightly bitter finish. I'd say this beer is pretty well balanced (still kinda sad it wasn't more sour). I am curious as to what the yeast does to this beer with some age on it. The mouthfeel is crisp and delightful.

With intended agitation of the bottle, the release of dregs and sediment was astounding, like one of those plastic shake up things with the snowman and "snow" inside it that you got as a kid when you visited Florida for the first time in winter. Massive dregs and particulate (I love that word) seasoning the brew as it circulates through the bomber bottle. To me this gives the brew character and I pour this through a ultra-fine strainer to weed out the largest fluid-borne mass. The nose of this brew is great; soft barnyard funk, horsehair and yeasty. A generous white head leads into a never ending meringue like slick with beautiful unctuous lacing. The taste is moderately bitter and tart with essence of lemon balm and slightly detectable candy sugars. This vibrancy from the zesty citric components lends to this brews drinkability that has a surprisingly plush mouthfeel. Clearly as this brew warms it becomes much more opulent; so drinking it at the proper temperature will provide for the most enjoyable experience.","barknee","Jan 04, 2010"

The aroma is surprisingly not as bretty as I had expected by reading some other reviews. While the brett funk is there, invoking damp earth and musty closets the caramel malts come through also lending toffee, biscuits and yeast to intermingle with the brett. The flavor is very reminiscent of the nose with caramel malts, giving a toffee/biscuit flavors along with the brett funk. To me, the brett lends itself to an earthy dampness that compliments the toffee rather nicely. Also a slight bit of alcohol show up as it warms. Its really nice to see a beer where the brett is domineering the show but at the same time I wish there was more of a brett presence in the beer. I know, I cant be pleased.

Not as much of the mustiness as there is in the nose. Actually reminds me of a more tart Duvel. But I was hoping for something a little more tart and, shall we say, barnyardish.

The flavour was fruity up front, more citrus/lemon than tropical though. Lingering bitterness. Moderate tartness through the middle, along with the earthy funk and wet grass. Fairly dry with ample carbonation and a lighter body. A bit coarse in texture. Alcohol wasn't evident. Solid overall.

It does hide the 9% very well and the brett is evident and very much appreciated. The more it warms up and releases carbonation the better it tastes. Definitely a sipper here.

It is fairly sour but the brett funk dominates and is not for the wimpy. This beer will not be many people's gateway to sours. The body is extremely light and the high 9% ABV is well hidden.

The foam dissipates quickly, leaving a thin sheet and a bit of lacing. Smells predominantly of sour fruit esters (namely lemon and cherry) and barnyard/horseblanket. The funky brett character really masks the bit sweet malt that's in the background. On the palate, the malt comes forward first, though it's again soon overshadowed by the sour yeast. Surprising bitterness that actually works very well. Nicely balanced and quite complex. An impressive beer overall.","philipquarles","Dec 04, 2008"

Honey and grain blend with yeast, straw, and funk with some peppery spices and clove thrown in for good measure. Finishes with a nice dry grass bitterness. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Not as sour as the nose suggested, a little bit medicinal at first but overall a nice mix of fruit, spices, and yeasty malt with a good bitter grassy finish.

Long-lived earthy aftertaste gives way to mild hop bitterness and keeps the fragrant flavor all the way through. Medium to full bodied with active carbonation that gives your tongue a little bite.

The nose is fruity and sour. The fruitiness is one that I am unable to specify although white grape comes to mind. It has a definite malty sugar presence that reminds the reviewer of candy. The taste is quite satisfying. It sort of reminds the reviewer of a white wine in the finish. I guess it must be the white grape impression leading me that way. It is sweet and sour. A bit of spiciness is noted. The beer is juicy and dare I say refreshing in a spritzer type fashion. It has a modicum of dryness which may be due in large part to alcohol which remains otherwise undetectable upon my palate. The mouthfeel is light, but the sugary aspects make it feel substantial. It seems to coat my teeth as though I were eating hard candies or something. The drinkability is good. This beer has a much welcomed flavour and it livens up my night simply by the alien nature of it. I am enjoying this and I have no regrets in its purchase.

Not quite so tart in the mouthfeel, surprisingly full of malt. Slight alcohol just before the finish. The high gravity makes this slightly too thin for the style. Flavours fails to develop through the tasting, even letting this one warm its hard to grasp much character. Boder-line tart - but really no sournness.

Once the yeast settles a bit, the scent is easier on the nose, but it is not indicative of the taste at all. Taste is good, not great, and not very "wild." Tart at first, this quickly fades to sweet, then finishes a bit tart again. I barely taste the brettanomyces, perhaps it's the saccharomyces that is the predominant yeast here.

Nose was strong and complex with fruity aromas galore from bananas to strawberries , followed by a strong sour note. Taste hits the buds very sour but in a good way and prepares your palate for a wave of complex fruity flavors, yeasty and full this is easy to drink at 9 percent.

Similar in some respects to an aged Orval, but with out the hop presence. There is a bit of lemon up front before the Brett.

It's certainly reminiscent of a lambic. The taste is something that takes time to become a friend. It's tartness and apparent lack of balance is a bit off-putting at first, but the flavor starts to make sense after half a glass or so.

This beer smelled exactly like that May morning 12 years ago. Ugghhh. Wild, vulgar, and nasty all at once. Unbelievable. Odd tasting tart, spritzy, bubbly sweet champagne like taste. I thought this would be like a spicy belgian dubbel. Instead it's the bastard son of a sun skunked Duvel and Andre Brut Champagne.
