After it warmed up a bit, the taste mellowed out and became very pleasant. Pouring the second half of the bottle in smooths out the taste and brings up more fruitiness and spices. In the end it turned out to be quite flavorful and complex. Would recommend to have this one.","JTuomi","Nov 21, 2014"

Very complex nose and flavor profile, with considerable spice (clove and nutmeg in particular), but with a very dry citrus and white pepper bitterness on the finish.  On the palate, you initially get considerable tropical fruit, but that's quickly pushed aside by the dry, hoppy, spiced fused finish.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and drinkability is excellent (though with all the different flavors in this beer, it's one you want to savor, appreciate and enjoy.).   Really a nice beere from De Dolle.","John_M","Nov 10, 2014"

There is a slight pepper aspect and mild lemon rind which is palatable with mild herbal bitterness coming through with a very dry crisp finish which is mostly yeast driven, however a subtle tropical taste of golden grapefruit is present. Overall a wonderful Belgian pale to quaff -very easy to drink considering the 8%, the only attribute that is lacking is taste slightly but I can only imagine how much better this was when fresh -outstanding!","Slatetank","Oct 15, 2014"

Palate is a medium to full body, crisp with good carbonation. The end much the same as taste, citrus, Belgian yeast, and sweet zesty, tangy spiced hops bitterness with some biscuit malt.

3.75,-8.1,,,,,,"Normal pour fills 2/3 of the glass with a dense white foam, even surface, close to zero lacing, retention is very good though. Cloudy liquid with a healthy amount of particulate, golden orange in color, could be rust water, huge amount of visible bubbles, wall-to-wall activity. The nose has a rough texture to it, wheat and grains, earth and peppercorns before slightly softening into banana, white grape and apricot pits, not that sweet and the clove to nutmeg spice could show more oomph, stays within itself well. In the mouth it’s full-bodied and tends to be bottom heavy, the carbonation is indeed strong so it makes you imagine what the feel would be like without it. Much more floral here with lemon accents, the clove stronger as well. For all the sweetness in the pear, yellow apple, apricot to banana fruit, dryness takes over past the mid-palate. Hay, quinine, spent lees, iron flecks, sort of heads in many directions at once. Astringent ending but can’t call it herbaceous nor really green in any manner. Seems to unclench some as it warms so may be one to linger over rather than quaff with abandon.","farrago","Sep 19, 2014"

Honeycrisp apples, bartlett pears, touch of riesling, clove, white pepper, and apricots. Maybe some golden raisins too. There's a lot going on here. Bit of earthiness (not like the lambic kind though), it's tough to explain that one. Maybe from the hop variety they use. But the beer is superbly smooth and drinkable.

Lemon predominates over pears, apples, and clove spiced bread. Wonderful! The initial taste is honey sweet fruit but finishes moderately bitter and dry. The bitterness is a surprise after the smell and initial taste and does not perfectly imtegrate with the initial impression. The mouthfeel is smooth and light but astringent at the end, like a dry wine or cider. I believe this beer is worth a try just for the smell.","tomfneph","Aug 05, 2013"

Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 22, 2013"

As the spring is about to arrive here in New York, I can't help but to envision sitting with a tall tulip glass of this, enjoying one of the earliest balmy spring suns.

The liveliness of the carbonation assists in moving the flavors of this strong brew across the tongue without becoming taxing. I would love to be able to definitively state how old this brew is but of course, such a means is not precisely documented. I can hardly make out a marking on the neck of the bottle that reads 350 07 which makes me think this was a 2007 best by date. Regardless, the age is felt in this with the oxidative touch and visually the bottle is stained in the familiar pattern conducive of a beer that has been resting for quite some time. Plain and simple, I need to buy more of this and drink it instead of laying it aside for years at a time.","stakem","Feb 26, 2013"

Aroma - hints of fruit (banana, cherry, pear, and tangy orange) as well as some faint hops, a grainy, yeasty character, and the alcohol acidity is clear as well. The flavor is softer than the aroma suggests... it's very balanced and smooth. The dominant bready malts are glossed over lightly with sweet apple and tart flavors. Alcohol is hardly noticed. The mouth feel is light, but 'creamy' as well. The finish has a pleasant tingling sensation as the slight bitterness comes out. Another great selection from De Dolle.

After a requisite waiting/re-pouring period, I am looking at a golden-orange liquid, completely opaque, with a dense, creamy off-white head. Aroma is big on spices, with coriander and clove leading the way. Yeast and light fruity hops as well. Flavor is lightly tart with some apricot, orange peel, and yeast.

Scent is quite a blend of sour over rippened fruit, day old bread and over kiln dried grain with a faint hint of earthy must. Taste moved in quite a different direction from scent - the dominant flavor is dry stale bread, but without the yeasty kick. The background has minimal notes of sour over rippened fruit and lightly toasted grain. Only a touch of honey and butter - the lack of sweetness leads to a lingering earthy quality. Medium bodied, very dry on palate, carbonation active for most of glass. The dry breadyness of the beer did not work that well with the perceived over rippened fruit notes, leaving my palate somewhat disapointed, especially after the solid nose.","rfgetz","Jul 07, 2011"

3.06,-25,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clear golden color that is a bit dark for the style, though not too much. Massive white head with some good lacing on the way down. The nose carries quite a bit of bread along with a very mild yeast presence. Flavor continues like this. It's simple -- which isn't necessarily a problem with the style -- but it gets the proportions wrong. The taste is too bready without any of the light stone fruit I'd like, or really much yeast character at all. The breadiness makes it too thick and chewy, and there's not as much carbonation as I'd like. With that said, it's still a well-made beer that I wouldn't complain about drinking again.","Thorpe429","Jun 29, 2011"

Be careful when pouring this or you’ll get foam from hell to breakfast! Aroma is not strong, but it is pleasingly malty and fruity and a little yeasty. Fruity, malty flavor has a surprisingly hoppy and bitter undertone. Sublime texture is silky smooth on the outside and lively and fizzy on the inside so it slides down the pipes easily yet leaves a nice tingle behind. Love them Belgians!","Cyberkedi","Jun 04, 2011"

4.18,2.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Arabier pours somewhere between a hazy tangering and full on orange. The cream colored head is absolutely towering, 4 fingers plus after pouring only about half the bottle. Retention is off the charts, 15 minutes later there's still a foam iceberg marooned in the center of my glass. Lacing is pretty good, but more spotty than cohesive sheets down the side of my glass, and just keeps the look from being about perfect. The nose is heavy on herbs and clove, with a bit of granny smith apples and pears peeking through as well. Neither the bottle or the De Dolle website mention anything about brett, but I swear there's a bit of funk to this one. Beyond that, the usual pale fruit sweetness leads off (though is unusually subdued) before a bigger than usual hop bite leads into a beautiful blend of herbal notes from the Nugget hops and clove and white pepper phenols from the yeast. A little bit firmer of a malt presence would balance the beer out a bit more and really elevate it even further. I don't mind my BSPAs being a bit on the dry side, but I'd say Arabier takes it just a bit too far. There's no substance to it at all body-wise. Carbonation is quite lively, and spot on for the style. Arabier is a relatively unique, interesting take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, and were it not quite so dry would be up there with Duvel as a top offering for the style.","axeman9182","Mar 06, 2011"

Smells like sweet apples and I can really smell the Belgian yeast. Slightly bitter on the finish. The taste is like sweet and sour apples, Belgian yeast with a bitter tart finish.

The flavor is a bit less controlled with a huge wave of sometimes harsh phenolic yeast flavors that threaten, but don't quite succeed, to wash away the creamy malt and atmospheric hops. This beer walks the line between complexity and becoming a hot mess, but thankfully it just barely manages to land on the side of excellence.

To the nose, this beer gives off scents off bread and citrus- namely grapefruit rind. When I took a small swig the grapefruit taste wasn't apparent, but the more I drank the stronger the grapefruit taste became; yet it still has a little breadiness and a bitterness from the hops which lends itself quite splendidly to that whole "grapefruit beer" kind of taste. In the mouth there is no lack of carbonation here with this beer, I think it's pretty light in weight though far from really light.

Out of the bottle it pours a slightly hazy brown/orange color with lots of rising carbonation and a monster of a white head. The nose is incredible as it is with many of De Dolle beers. Big floral esters, mint, lemon, sweet malts and subtle but detectable hops. Its hard to define the taste of Ara, so crisp and refreshing, yeast and malt invade first, nothing overwhelming just a nice flow of light flavor, it falls off midway leaving the bright fruitiness and moderate hop bite. It sports a medium body with lots and lots and lots of tiny carbonation bubbles.

The only complaint I have is that it may be a little too sweet, but sometimes I take a sip and think its perfect, the next too sweet.

2.6,-36.3,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,2,"11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Carbonation formed in the bottle immediately after popping the cap, resulting in a slight overflow. Pours a murky dark orangish color with some yeast floating around. This is definitely a slow pour, with a massive head forming from the high amount of carbonation. The aroma is fruits (mainly apples and pears) with a touch of spices and yeast. The taste has a peppery spiciness to it with a dose of earthy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is very light bodied and very heavily carbonated. Overall, De Dolle Ara Bier is an interesting Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but there is a really strong medicinal aftertaste that turns me off to it. It is worth a shot for its uniqueness, but I don't think I would purchase again.","cjgator3","Jun 21, 2008"

I find the carbonation a little much - strong enough that it gets hard to taste the beer. And once the carbonation did die down, big band-aid and medicinal phenols took over the aroma.

The one I decided on, and not 100% certain why was this Ara Bier. The brew poured to a dark golden color, with a distinct brown hue. The pour gave a huge head that filled the glass perfectly with the end of the pour producing a good amount of yeast particles. The aroma had a number of properties that came out to me. Nice fruit, apple and pear, maybe (?) more than a slight earthy barnyard smell, and spices that seem to be mostly clove. The aroma was also pretty good as the fruit notes seem to come out more as I seem to pick up more apple along with a sweet sensation probably from the malts. Has what I would classify as a slight hop start to it, very mild and goes away quickly to the sweet flavor described above. Overall I must say that I enjoyed this brew, not my favorite but it was a nice change to the normal stuff I have been having. I would get this one again in the future, surprising that it is at 7% as I did not pick up much in the way of alcohol notes sticking out.","Stimack","Jan 05, 2008"

I read an earlier review that described this as overly phenolic.I have to agree wholeheartedly. Pours a very cloudy golden, like a hefeweizen in color, but with a huge creamy head that pillows into hills and valleys in the glass. The smell is funky, slightly sour, and quite clovey. This is just a touch of medicinal funk as well. The taste is shocking. Starts slightly sour and a bit sweet, and quickly transitions into band-aids, burnt plastic, wood, and a smokiness on the finish. In a way it is weirdly fascinating, but ultimately it is hard to stomach. Mouthfeel is very nice. Quite carbonated and soft and creamy with the jolt of all that carbonation keeping it lively. It does improve somewhat as it warms, but the medicinal flavors are stronger than any other I've ever tasted. Ultimately I'm barely able to keep taling sips of this to review- and I can't say I'm enjoying it. I think this is one that gets worse with age.","Georgiabeer","Jan 04, 2008"

3.52,-13.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Calling this beer a Pale is kind of a stretch. In fact anything but a Biere de Garde would be a mis-classification. This is one weird beer. A very woodsy, nutty, fruity, dirty, musty character chases this beer throughout, at times robbing it of sweetness, but adding a ton of comlexity. Aromas are boarderline barnyard, dusty, and like grandma's attic. Flavors are less funky, but more woodsy, tart, and full of rotten fruits. The yeast / bacteria has stripped the beer of much of it's sweetness and body, but the other complex flavors, textures, and aromas compensate well. The beer has an overwhelming phenolic character that passes plastic and medicinal notes, and well into a smoky, scorched flavor. Finishes as muddles as the flavors with the low-lying sweetness going first, and a tart, cheesy flavor lingering. It's basically an alcoholic mud puddle.","BEERchitect","Oct 25, 2007"

Light hoppiness and, overall clean smelling with a light yeast mustiness. Introduction of lees attributes a mild spiciness. Trace amounts of a medicinal quality, but nothing severely off. Slightly sweet and an herbal, hoppy finish that is rather sedate, yet noticable. Very refined and elegant. For some odd reason, I didn't really know what to expect from this beer, but I surely was not disappointed. A very tasty pale. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet spritzy. Finely tuned and highly recommended.

Honeyish malt is the base on which dances an above average hop character for a belgian beer, citrusy, lemony, sprucey. Notes of bread, farmhouse, apple and pepper+cloves. I expected this to be the least interesting De Dolle, but how wrong I was, this one is fabulous, complex, yeasty, balanced, refreshing and almost a session beer. Palate is dry up front, hoppy with a generous bitter finish, but all kinds of things happening in between. Theres a subdued fruitiness in the likes of grapefruit, apple, orange or apricot and complex complementing spices. Refreshing mild tart profile. Great creamy and velvety mouthfeel with above average carbonation. I just played a few hours of tennis and this is a superb "sunny day welcome".

Taste is initially spicy, with some rounding out with pale malts, and sharpens up with some hops bite, amongst other varied flavors. A busy set of taste buds on this one.

I was disappointed most of all by the taste, as the tartness was just overpowering, and didn't match the aroma. Spicy hops and alcohol. Grainy and phenolic. I detected some charcoal and metallic notes as well that were rather unpleasant. Mouthfeel was prickly, which matches this style fairly well, and grows smoother with every mouthful.

If the yeast at the bottom is disturbed, however, it becomes a hazy marmalade, but at the same time delivers more flavor via the yeast. The bright nose is yeasty, floral, subtly fruity, delicately spicy (cloves) and welcoming! Some acetaldehdye (green apple) and candyish notes (from a combination of phenols and sweet malt) arise as it warms. A very fine, effervescent carbonation is achieved through bottle conditioning, and combines with it's medium body to leave it gently zesty on the tongue before warming to become velvety smooth across the tongue. The flavor delivers fruitiness and hints at tartness upfront before a honeyish and mildly nutty maltiness and spicy, grassy, leafy and floral hop flavor becomes apparent. Its bright hoppiness is quite a twist on the standard Belgian golden strong ale style!

Herbal, earthy hops, citrus and passion fruit along with a refreshing acidity quality are all present on the palate. Well-attenuated and aging nicely, this ale's mouthfeel is quite smooth and appealing. Drinks quite well for a brew of 7% abv -- the alcohol is hard to taste.

Had an odd smell, a little bit like honey, but with a strange, unpleasant odor vying for attention.

The aroma for this one had a lot of spices and hops in it with some small hints of yeast. The flavor was very tart and spicy with the alcohol being far too prominent for only having 7%.

Smooth and pleasant mouthfeel, w/ a medium body that keeps this brew very drinkable.  Finishes sweet with an unexpected and odd lingering non hop derived bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Although sweeter and not as complex as other Belgian Strongs, Ara is flavorful and light enough to be quite drinkable.","marc77","Jun 15, 2002"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice orange color with some pretty intense thick head.  I am staring at my empty glass now and seeing the history of every sip I took on the side of the bottle.  Nice fruity, almost citrus, flavors.  Moderately spicey/zesty with a good amount of malt character.  Ordered myself a case of this as I find it a nice beer to drink out on the deck while reading or hanging with friends.","jreitman","May 12, 2002"
3.65,-10.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was surprised to find this beer to be fairly average all around.  Light orange color.  Some acidity, some apricot flavor.  The flavor appears upfront and then promptly disappears.  I actually wish I had poured more yeast into the glass so this beer would have exhibited more flavor.","Andy","May 05, 2002"
