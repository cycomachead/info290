2.94,-19,3,2.75,3,3,3,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle to a pint glass. Next to no head or carbonation on this one. A dark gold color as would be expected for the style. Next to no lacing. Medium light penetration. Perhaps it was just my bottle, but I got next to no aromas on mine. I get notes of honey (almost like a green tea) and lemon. Possibly some coriander or cinnamon. Goes down okay at first, but with the spices, has a bit of a bite at the end. Overall, this beer was okay. I remember having it years ago and it tasting much better. Maybe I had an off bottle, but if this is the consensus of most people (I have not read other reviews), I can not say I would be running out to get more of this. Personally, I got this in a 6-pack sampler from a friend for Christmas.","JeffBrenner","Feb 14, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spices, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a yeast and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

The taste for this beer was far too light and contained lightly dry and crispy floral hops, sour apples, and a small pinch of yeast at the end. As you can tell, there wasn't much of anything to the taste. It really didn't have anything going for it. The mouthfeel was really light and had a very faint aftertaste of crispy floral hops.

The finish has a touch of alcohol as well as some spicy notes of higher alcohols. The beer has a nice spiciness to it that, when combined with the solid carbonation, gives this beer a certain zippiness. Notes of pepper, spicy ginger notes, some definite clove and a certain amount of lemon zest are just a few of the spice notes that I can pick out of the flavors. This is definitely the tastiest brew I have had from these guys. It captures the complexity of a good Belgian brewed strong ale quite well.","Gueuzedude","Feb 21, 2006"

The taste was sweet and citric, with bananas, lemongrass, and black peppers flavoring the swallow. The carbonation was airy and prickly, and mouthfeel quite light. Although well made, there was also a strange feeling of emptiness and artificiality to this beer. This may have been the result of sugar derived alcohol, or might have been due to a relative lack of complexity. Whatever it was, the beer started out quite well, and fizzled out near the end.","rajendra82","Dec 30, 2005"

3.15,-13.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This brew is a mostly clear gold color with a very slight haze and endless streams of bubbles rising through the liquid. The pour initially produces a large white head that quickly settles to a distinct wispy ring. Not much lace. The aroma is peppery, with whiffs of banana, malt, candy, and ripe fruit. An initial impression of sweetness, spice, and an alcohol harshness make up the taste. To be honest, it really be better. The harshness and a grainy, misplaced bitterness are pretty distracting. Despite the initial impression, the beer really dries out, and actually develops some astringency. Peppery and somewhat bitter finish. Medium body. I dont want to pan this brewits more or less drinkable, it just could be a whole lot better.","Suds","Nov 28, 2005"
3.07,-15.4,3.5,4,2.5,3,3,"Pours slightly hazy with an intense medium gold color and an impressive 3/4" fizzy head. Generous nose of coriander and fresh lemon, accompanied by warming alcohol. The taste is medium bodied at best, fairly balanced acidity with flavors of lemon, grains of paradise and honey. It is mildly tart and dry. Mouthfeel is fair, with a slight coating of honey and spice in the mouth. This brew had an unpleasant aftertaste; one of dry-stale grains, although this brew was recently brewed. Drinkability is good, as long as you don't stop to allow the aftertaste to develop. This is a relatively average example of the style; Not particularly enjoyable, generally uneventful and lacking the overall competency that I look for in a product like this. Grand Cru it aint!","barknee","Nov 23, 2005"

4.27,17.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beautifully clear golden orange, solitary little carbonation bubbles floating up happily. Amazing clarity for a bottle conditioned belgian ale. My experience is that belgian yeast stirs itself up if you look at the bottle too long. A straight pour produces a full white head, dropping into a collared pool of mist. Patchy lace. Retention could be better, the head completely disappearing about halfway through. A rough swirl of the glass stirs up at least a collar. Rather spicy aroma, with that signature belgian yeast character. Strong phenols, very clovey and peppery. Creamed corn. A lick of alcohol. Fruity and malty, with a floral hop background. Styrian goldings? Maybe a bit of Saaz soapiness? I like belgian pales like this. Plenty of character, with loads of fruit flavor. Toasty caramel malt. I don't know if it's unusual, but it definitely feels like it's got a bit of wheat malt in here, with that soft feel and a touch of sourness. Vibrant carbonation, fizzing away like mad as the beer enters your mouth. Very tingly, almost tongue numbing. Medium bodied, with a soft, slick mouthfeel that holds things together. Heavy clove and plastic phenols in the finish, with tons of yeast spiciness and a hint of floral hops. Malty, but well balanced with the yeasty pepperiness and phenols. A lick of alcohol in the end belies the beer's potency. I'd guess about 8%-ish. I really like this beer. Sweet, a bit sour and very spicy. I've never been terribly crazy about Flying Fish's beers, but this one should make any brewery proud. I'd buy a case of this without looking at the price, easy. The only way I could imagine it to be better would be to have it off a gravity poured oak cask..","UnionMade","Beers"

The smell is light and fruity sweet--pears, apricots, lemon and a little coriander. Taste is mild sweetness up front, with the pear coming through again balancing a pleasant hoppiness I didn't detect on the nose, and throughout an assertive peppery spiceness prevails. Medium body, moderately carbonated, and a crisp dry finish.

I get some creamy orange and banana with a light spiceyness and a distant hint of alcohol. The feel is moderate with a fairly active carbonation.

I want more from a grand cru. This is basically a slightly off-style Belgian Witbier. Very small for a grand cru as well. Moderate mouthfeel and decent drinkability, but I want a lot more from something that you call a grand cru. This is a tasty Belgian Wit, but not a grand cru.

It pours a nice golden hue with a whitish head that is relatively long lasting in a pint. The lacing is very heavy throughout the pour. There are some really heavy spicy aromas and flavors here. There is a definite yeasty taste and some cinnamon and nutmeg flavor. The beer is full-bodied but not clinging. It has a very clean feeling in the mouth, and goes down really easily.

All in all, the beer is very "warming." The brewers tell me this is the big brother of their summer ale and it shows.

The palate is very pleasant malty, toasted crackers are upfront with spicy hops, alcohol, fruitiness, nuts, and sugary sweetness towards the end pleasant. Smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel, a touch thin very easy to drink. It is enjoyable to quaff. The alcohol doesnt fuzzy-up the mind.

It was opaque or cloudy but not overly cloudy that I couldnt see the carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom. The head was white in color and seemed to be quite foamy and creamy and it lasted well into the mid-glass. It left behind a nice creamy lace as well. The aromas that came from the glass were of fruits, citrus fruits, hops, flowers, sweet malts, caramel a few spices and a slight yeasty bread at the end smell. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of fresh fruit (apricots, apples), floral hops, roasted nuts, sweet malts, caramel, citrus (oranges and lemons), yeast, fresh pine, spices and alcohol (which was definitely present). Served cold, I noticed that the hops seemed to dominate the aftertaste, but as it warmed a nice combination of alcohol flowers, and a dark caramel seemed to be more dominate in the after glow.

It has a lightly fruity and spicy flavor with yeast, light hops, and a dry alcohol finish. It is a light bodied brew and drinkability is not really there. In my opinion, this is a Belgian Light-Dry.

Not over the top, but nice, and subtle. Taste is also subtle, though a bit one-dimensional (which isn't necessarily bad) and perhaps a bit thin. Fruity flavors, hints of bubble gum, some pepper.

3.77,3.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Fresh on draft 2002 - only recently released from the brewery by about a week or so. I was told by the brewery rep that they had "bumped it up a little bit this year". Deep golden, slightly hazy, with some tiny particulate. Firm white head that holds quite well and initially leaves sheets of lace. Very nice. The aroma is quite spicy (from the Belgian yeast strain - no additional spices are added) with lots of Saaz hops over a vanilla-tinged maltiness. The body is medium with a very fine carbonation, leaving it quite smooth in the mouth. A wrestling match takes place between the malt and the spice. Although the spiciness is there continually, and sometimes peppery but without any serious weight behind it, the almost-cookie-dough sweet malt does get some good hits in. Much more vibrant than the aged (1 year) bottle that I recently reviewed. But the alcohol is also clearer and the spiciness is a bit bold. Still, fairly well-balanced with both the bitterness and spicy hop flavor supporting the maltiness. My guess is that this is a little more attenuated than last year's, giving more alcohol and a slightly less full maltiness. It finishes nicely dry with a long, lingering, fresh and spicy hop note. Still my favorite beer from Flying Fish although I think I'll pick up a case of bottles to cellar at least until spring! Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","0"
