Compared to a Duvel or Delirium Tremens, this beer does not hold up. It lakes the buttery texture and complex flavor profiles of the Belgian originals. That said, this is a very good attempt at a difficult style. Aromatic but not pungent; fairly high in ABV (but lower than most Belgian examples). Main complaint would be the hop character is too pronounced for this style. Given that this is made in CA, I am not surprised by that. I would still say that Old Rasputin is the standard bearer for this brewery.","Wobbly","Aug 29, 2014"

Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped but that is about it. The aroma is just malts for the most part with a hint of some sweetness, like honey. More going on with the taste with the malt up from followed by some spice, maybe coriander. Finishes with a slight sweet that is a tad dry also.

What makes this better than the average American interpretation is the complexity of flavor. Most American triples are a simple dry version of what the Belgian's do. This triple (while possessing the simple character of the triple) has the soft complexities that you get from the best Belgian's in this category. My only disappointment with this beer is that the head dissipates far faster than a Delerium or Duvel. It is gone in seconds and I expect a beer of this type to create a head that lasts.","ewvanconant","Aug 10, 2014"

It really works though. While Duvel is all about clean pilsner malt character and great balance, Pranqster achieves a similar balance, albeit with a wheaty approach and perhaps a bit more complexity because of it. Yeast, malt (and wheat adjunct), and hops all work very harmoniously together, and this ends up being far too easy to finish.","ryan1788a5","Jul 12, 2014"

It goes down easy peazy like a pilsner or something but packs a punch at 7.6%. I imagine it would go well in spring or summer, but it has a richness that makes it good anytime. It's highly drinkable but not really sessionable, per se. It is sweet and fruity and bubblegummy and clovey maybe? Read other reviews if you want that detailed stuff. This would be a great introduction to trippels or the Belgian style as it is so approachable but funky and complex.

3.92,-2.7,4,4.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"First time trying this or anything from North Coast for that matter. I don't usually go for the four packs but it was on sale, whoo! Pours golden, totally clarified, effervescing like crazy, with about an inch of cream head. Smells of crisp apple, yeast, a little funkiness. Somewhat underwhelming flavor profile given the nose. Alcohol comes through a bit, more cidery than I expected, lightly sweet, yeasty, and tad bitter at the finish. Mouthfeel is on the lower side of medium, and the carbonation is really apparent. I gotta say, there's almost something pilsner-like about it, and I like a good pils, but was expecting something more like a tripel. Definitely get a warming sensation in the belly from the 7.6 abv. Overall, I think it's good but I'm not wowed by it. I will say as it warms it opens up a bit more, but still not super-impressed. I must also say that I felt pretty much the same way about Don de Dieu and Damnation, two other highly rated Belgian strong pales. Good beer, but I probably wouldn't get it again over something like NB Trippel or GD Orabelle.","BeerWizard","Oct 12, 2013"

Apple and some yeasty tones soon came out. The taste is much the same. Very much a Belgian strong ale, but the abv taste and smell was none existent, which I loved. Goes down smooth even with the presence of good carbonation also. Will certainly buy again in the future.","Ac2013","Oct 08, 2013"

Duvel, Tremens, and Don de Dieu are among my favorite beers. And indeed it had a nice start. The beer looked beautiful in my large wine glass. Great hazy, golden straw color. Huge foamy head. Lots of carbonation bubbles. But the smell was just ok, if not a bit on the funky side. As for taste, something was clearly lacking. It seemed to need more sweetness, a little less dryness on the finish, more oomph. I kept hoping it would improve as it warmed, but any flavor bump was very subtle. The mouthfeel was a different matter. If the taste matched the feel, this beer would have been great. Nice and creamy, full, very smooth. I'll give this beer another try, and I'm hoping I just got a bad bottle. But I'm a little disappointed.","Beer-A-Lot","Sep 28, 2013"

Not sure who has rated this beer highly because it really has nothing to offer other than it has a nice light feel in the mouth and the taste does not linger. I really try to appreciate the positive attributes of every beer but this one really challenges me. At least it has a 7.6% alcohol content. Bottom line: they named this beer perfectly.

Pranqster is one that competes very handily with those coming from across the pond. The fact that it is easy to find is a bonus. I actually like this ale better than Duvel. The flavors of Pranqster are a little bolder, thanks to the Belgian yeast "funk", and it's not quite as carbonated as Duvel. Pranqster is a beer that I can drink often, and not get tired of it.","glb3","Feb 25, 2013"

Taste of big apple, pear, wheat, bread, pepper, earth, grape, clove, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, wheat, bread, pepper, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a light, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice.

It has a beautiful golden appearance with a smell with notes of banana and a slight citrus.... The taste is very yeasty with plenty hints of lemon and spices.... It has true Belgian taste to it that leaves a pleasant aftertaste which doesn't linger too long.... I've had similar tasting beers that had twice the ABV, so I'd recommend this brew.","DannyHartman","Sep 07, 2012"

Pours a thick amber-orange liquid- (you barely see your hand through the glass) A sturdy head from pour eventually seeps down to a half finger ring that floats above the liquid as you drink down to the bottom of the glass. The aroma has a lot of good things contributing to it; slight banana funk yeast pillowed with citrus hops and suggestions of vanilla toffee, some caramel, slight honey. The taste is just as it smells with the yeast and hops being brought with a bubbly shake by the carbonation and the aftertaste having dominance in the sweet candy flavor. Ends dry and feeling good each sip. This is a very enjoyable beer that I would return to.","tilopud_rye","Jul 14, 2012"

Medium bodied with lower carb and a forgettable finish. Overall a decent beer, great for a hot day.","harrymel","Apr 20, 2012"

4.1,1.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4," Pours an apricot/orange color w/ a one finger white head. Good carbonation and lacing on the snifter glass. A little bit hazy, cloudy in appearance. Nose is coriander, peach, orange, clove, and some yeast. The nose is really nice- a little on the sweet side, but if I closed my eyes- this could be a Belgian beer off the nose. Apricot really comes out in the taste, along w/ the nose profile characters. It's good, just a little on the fruit juice side of things in regard to sweetness and consistency. Feel is very sweet/smooth w/ a medium body and a sweet aftertaste. The spices really come out in the aftertaste as well, and linger forever. Overall, this is a really good beer. I will definitely pick this up again. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Oct 17, 2011"

Though the aroma is sweet and fruity, it is immediately dry to the taste with a moderate amount of hops. Compared to other california beers the hops are delicately blended within the other flavors instead of being a separate presence from everything else that is happening on the palate. Spicy phenols are constant, as is some fusel (one can tell all the sugar has been converted in this beer). Finishes warm and dry.

The taste brings in more of the same, along with some coriander, vanilla, very light caramel, and a dash of ginger.

The head was thin and left just a little lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was a little spicy and mostly made up of Belgian yeast aromas. The flavors of this beer are what I thought was pretty standardto the style. It was big ion the bread yeast flavors which brought along some banana and clove. The hops weren't overly powerful here.

I want this brew to go one of two ways, either have a bigger malt presence, or have a lower alcohol content to be more of a session beer.

The taste was also pretty citrusy with belgian yeast flavors and lots of sweetness from the malts however I still detected bubble gum candy notes on the palate. It was medium inbody with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty, citrusy, silky, and sticky finish.

Fairly well carbonated. Nose bears forth cinnamon, Belgian yeastiness, cantaloupe, and a hint of pineapple. Nose is subtle, however...gotta kinda search for it. Flavor is exceptionally well balanced between the yeast and malt. Not very hoppy. The cinnamon and cantaloupe flavors arethere, but in the background. The flavor evolves into some unique stuff, hard to place, but very unique. Rounded of by a very clean finish that makes this well priced beer amazingly quick-drinking, and at the somewhat high ABV of 7.6% that makes this one dangerous. Very good and a must try folks.","SolomonGrundy","Sep 01, 2010"

Begins with bright flavors of pale grain, orange rind, flowers; Belgian yeast adds musty funk and light tartness. Spicy. Spritzy and light on the palate, clean finish with a nice grainy aftertaste.

The nose is bready and estery, with hints of pepper and bubblegum. Similar on the palate; sweet pale malts meet bubblegum, pepper, fresh herbs and dried fruit (banana, pear). It's complex, but the sweetness and phenols are too much for me, and there's not enough carbonation to cleanse the palate between sips. Not terribly impressive stuff.","largadeer","Feb 27, 2010"

And the clove note is way out of balance with the others. Taste is good, but mainly because I like clove-y beers. Same notes as the nose, but still out of balance. Yeasty too.

Soft & pretty aromas of lemon, subtle orange, light banana esters, a touch of honey, a fresh bread yeastiness (almost biscuit like), pear, gala apple, hints of passion fruit, mango, wild flowers (definitely Stargazer Lilly) follow through as mouth watering flavors on the palate. Although the nose seems a bit straight forward, it's elegant, complex, pretty, & I just simple couldn't put the glass down because I kept finding more subtle characteristics! On the palate, the beer has a somewhat creamy texture, great acidity, long finish, a slight drying sensation (not talking about tannins), & a noticeable/slightly unbalanced alcohol presence that, in all honesty, isn't necessarily unwelcome.

I'd have this again, but probably not until after I've sampled some more offerings in this vein. Although, as I continue to work through my glass...it's *very* warming on a cold rainy night, and it's highly addictive.

No head at all after a loud popping fizzy head disappeared very quickly. Depending on the light backing it, the beer went from orange to bronze to yellow. Sweet fruits and honey dominate the smell. Yeasty strangeness attacks the tongue with a fresh fruitiness that doesn't offend or please. The mouthfeel is so weird. Bittingly crisp, leaves the tongue numb and tingly, finishes very dry. Its abv is fairly noticeable. It is just a strange beer with a strange spelling. You may think its great, or not great, or like me, not be able to tell the difference.","joshuadlight","Aug 10, 2009"

Showing their expertise, the brew was poured perfectly with two fingers of puffy, beige head like a dome atop the fluid. The aroma was semi-sweet and very appealing with notes of Belgian yeast, floral hops, orange, light toffee, sweet malt and light tropical fruit. The flavors were complex and on-point for the style. I tasted yeast, tropical fruit, wheat, candy sugar, light toffee, tart and citric hop built on a doughy malt backbone. For as big as it was the alcohol was well-concealed but became more apparent as the beer warmed. Well-balanced and crisp for as big and layered as it was. It was also dangerously drinkable. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. It was a treat to find it on-tap and it's one I'd recommend.","thekevlarkid","Jul 07, 2009"

Full-bodied with frothy carbonation which clings to your mouth pores like scrubbing bubbles. All that clove, ginger, coriander spice alive here with deeper accentuation to the orange, lemon citrus.

I've had other belgians that were to my liking, that had more varied flavors and reminded me more of autumn colors/smells than of chomping on a wooden table.

The finish is a touch bitter but that is the only place where the hops come through, peppery dry as well after the bitterness moves through. Mouthfeel is lively, peppery with a touch of alcohol and very pleasant. Wow this is a really good, easy drinking, well rounded, beer it's fairly middle of the road for the style tending more towards the sweet/fruity end of the spectrum, but it is still so very well crafted that it is a joy.

The taste is malt with some pears and apple flavors and other fruits. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.

The head only settles by half, settling into a thick, clingy collar. I see the usual Belgian effervescence, lots of tiny bubbles rising & swirling in the glass. Aroma is of candy sugar & sweet fruits (peaches, apricots, grapes). The fruity characteristic dominates the taste at first, with some spice & floral notes and no hint of the 7.6% alcohol content. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium, and sparkly from all the bubbles, almost champagne-like! Dangerously drinkable due to it's medium body, luscious flavor, and how well hidden the alcohol is!

There is a very fruity yeast flavor that is predominant, but hops are also detectable deep in the taste.

Spicy Belgian phenolics, Pilsener malt, and Styrian hops make up the inticing aroma, with a whiff of booze and tropical fruit becoming stronger as it warms. Sharp Pils, soft wheat and pale candy sugar upon the first sip. The aftertaste is quite dry with very light noble hop flavor and mild bitterness, but a showcase of bubblegum and spicy phenolics balance the malt well. Light and airy body, though it seems like a once heavy beer thinned out from simple sugars. The carbonation is aggressive and needle-like, which aids in lifting the strong malt presence and phenols from the tounge. The finish shows some earthy yeast tones, a little booze and some residual swetness, but the yeast character fades gracefully with the malt and never becomes significantly cloying or hot. An excellent american interpretation of the style.","PBRstreetgang","Jun 27, 2007"

While the head was at its fullest, it appeared very thick. This thickness remained in the lacing. Smell was sweet fruit, yeast, and a damp cellar. I thought this combination was quite pleasant. Taste was sweet fruit up front, a tiny bit of that metallic taste that's so common among Belgians in the middle, and then a dry, corn-based breakfast cereal finish. Corn Pops, anyone?

A slight aroma of cloves or coriander is noted along with a slight vanilla and orange peel aroma that is fairly pleasing. Fairly sweet to sip, lots of cloves tasted up front along with other spices (maybe coriander if I am correct). A nice balanced maltiness comes out as well, all while I taste a bit of orange peel or other citrus fruits. Body is quite nice and balanced between a slight carbonation leading to a nice fairly crisp body in which the alcohol tends to be quite mild really. The finish is very nice, and it doesn't dry out as much as anticipated.

However, now that I can purchase Unibroue in Omaha I donÂ’t think IÂ’ll go back to Pranqster anytime soon.

The taste is pleasant not aggressive or demanding decently balanced, the effervescence is a little lacking. This is not by any means my favorite Belgian style golden ale let alone belgian strong pale ale, but its decent. I keep thinking of october for some reason when drinking this.

The nose is dominated by a slightly vegetal smell that reminds me of peanut butter. Not too appetizing. The palate is a mix of alcoholic burn, sugar sweetness and that peanut buttery thing.

Flavor is crisp and fruity, initially yeasty, with bits of lemon and clove, some sweet orange, some grassiness, and a tart finish. A bitter tang lingers, turning to yeast.

This beer is very drinkable even at 7.6% abv. In my personal opinion this is just a hair below Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde, but better than Duvel.

This brew could've benefited from more malt flavors and texture, but it was still a good beer. Good mouthfeel was rich and enjoyable.

Smell smacks you in the face with vinegar astringency, alcohol fumes, and oh yeah, some apricot/peach-like fruit. I don't know about this one. Thankfully, the vinegar takes a back seat in the flavor department, letting the light fruit, citrus, floral hoppiness, and caramel malt backbone take precedence, though there's still a hefty alcoholic kick in the end which could be expected from 7.6%, but I would have hoped to be hidden a little better. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and crisp. Overall a perplexing Belgian Pale here. The fruity peach/apricot flavors were nice, but that overpowering vinegar scent and punch brought it down a notch from being a great Belgian.

The taste is lightly sweet with a medium fullness on the palate, that is typically a little to heavy, but well within the American interpretation of a Belgian beer (afraid to use adjuncts/sugar?). The taste has notes of ginger, a grassy herbal character, coriander, lemon, and pears.

The haziness brought on by the addition of the yeast doesn't bother me and I seem to enjoy my Belgian Pales in this manner. Aroma was nice and spicy. Notes of bananna and clove dominate the nose (with the clove slightly edging out the bananna. Taste has a lot of that bananna flavor, the strongest that I've ever experienced outside of a hefe.

The rolling bubbles seemed to suggest it was too carbonated...it helped cloud the beer on opening, and lent a message that I remember from the one brew I did that seemed to have been infected with a wild yeast: the flavor pitched too much toward fruit. In this case it wasn't entirely unpleasant, more like banana, but that isn't one of my favorite hints. I was expecting maybe a little more malt in my yeast--and perhaps more in the scent as well. Hops were almost absent. The best part was definitely the mouth where even the volume of carbonation didn't seem harsh--as it often can when there is too much. Just slightly sticky with sweetness, and full. For 7+ABV it was gentle, and I have no doubt the quality was there if not the flavor i prefer.

Aroma: Banana and spices galore slight citrus tone done to perfection, and if sampled in a blind tasting with a Piraat or Duvel this one may just take the cake not as alcholic in flavor as the latter two, but this one contains streaming tones of candied sugar and so much bubble gum esque tones with a undertow of mustiness to complete it. Taste: Flavor is sharply sweet but not cloying wow what balance between an unpronounced hop bitterness and spices and yeast characteristics that could make one melt away toward northern California. Speaking of Cali I am listening to Led Zeppelin's "Going to California", and don't aske why but lately I have been blending two of my favorite things together music and beer as one emotional experience.

Dryish notes of bread and peppery alcohol initially in flavor, ceded by green apple laced cidery sweetness and hints of black licorice. Pseuso biscuit malt impression from the suspended yeast lends a nutty, toast component to the malt profile. Hop bitterness cuts sharply into residual sweetness, helping lend both balance and a refreshing dry nature to this brew. Lightly bodied, yet full and dextrinous in mouthfeel.

The aroma is very champagne-esque and fruity (especially pineapple). The taste is slightly winey and, again, fruity but there's also a corn-syrupy sweetness that immediately reminds me of those huge multi-colored suckers I used to get as a kid at the state fair.

Orangey-gold in color, with a heavy sediment of yeast (if you choose to pour the yeast) and a large, fluffy, small-bubbled blanket of a head, PranQster looks and smells the part of a Belgian style Strong Golden Ale. The nose, like a foreshadowing of the beer itself, is immensely complex, with a yeasty start, followed by a citrusy-sweet, doughy aroma. The yeast itself contributes a dry, grainy, horsey aroma, like several other Belgian ales I can think of. The body is sweet, yet deceptively light, with a grittiness from the yeast not found in other Belgian Golden Ales. Iâ€™m reminded somewhat of the gelatinous filling of a lemon bar when I first sip a PranQsterâ€¦. The finish is rather long and sweet but not cloying, with some light spiciness evident.
