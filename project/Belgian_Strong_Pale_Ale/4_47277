4.11,2,4.5,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Beautiful slightly milky yellow. Thin small head. Nice tight knit lace left on glass I am not getting much hop aroma -some is there but nothing like a dry hopped American pale ale. Hop aroma balances well with malt aroma and fruit background. Light sour smells also. It all blends together well. Contrasting broad flavor palette. Hop bitterness definitively present. Fruit, light citrus, yeast tastes. Reminds me somewhat of a good American champagne re  yeast, acid, fruit balance. Bret character is well balanced. smooth mouthfeel. After swallowing I'm left with bitterness on the sides of my tongue, minor sourness, and the smooth mouthfeel. Very interesting beer. Opening  up as it warms. Others have said tart - yes that's it, not sour but tart.","Nife","Mar 20, 2015"
4.55,12.9,4,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Wow what a tasty brew. Spices remind me of a nice chai tea, really really pleasant. Wish the price point was more reasonable.","mcbratz1187","Mar 18, 2015"
4.21,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Aroma is light fruit, some apples and pears but a  stronger element of white grapes. The follow-on scent is a mildly sour, funky  aroma that is distinct from the usual Strong Pale Ale presence.  Flavor is very good. The fruit malt and yeast up front are strong, slightly sweet and very tasty. The sourness and funk are  fairly mild, but an interesting change of pace from the standard BSPA flavor. The  transition is seamless and the funk in no way diminishes  the traditional flavor.  Mouthfeel is rich, alcohol presence is minimal, and the variety off flavors is just right on the tongue.  An excellent brew!!!!!","JayQue","Mar 08, 2015"

Crisp aroma has a strong overtone of apple, rather like a cider. Lip-smacking flavor has a malty core and a strong, slightly sweet, slightly tart apple overtone and a whisper of butterscotch. Firm texture has a good amount of tingle and fizz, leaving a nice fruity and tart finish.","Cyberkedi","Feb 02, 2015"

4.15,3,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4,"This beer is between gold and straw in color, with a haze similar to a hefeweizen. The aroma is a tropical fruit and peppery spice. There is a passion fruit flavor with a subtle brett flavor of old socks (but old socks that taste good). I have definitely had several beers where the brett is a little overpowering, but this beer had a nice blend of fruity notes from the yeast and sweetness from the malt that works well with the brett. I really enjoyed it because all the flavors work really well together.","i4ourgot","Feb 08, 2014"

4.08,1.2,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"The beer pours a very strong and foamy clean white head. The head lasts a while and the lacing on the glass form a perfect ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a clear yellowish copper. The beer smell is fairly complex with a hint of tartiness. The smell has bits of a bread smell from the malts. The tarty Brett smell is there as well and is slightly obscured by the white wine smell as well as the hops. The hops are fairly close to a slightly grassy smell and orangey smell. The white grapes smell makes it difficult to properly distinguish. The beer taste is different from the smell. The beer taste is primarily hops mixed with the Brett. The malts make an appearance as a backbone for the taste and balances out the hops and Brett. In addition to the hops, the beer also has a white wine taste to it with hints of citrus orange. The feels is fairly clean and goes down similar to water. The finish is fairly dry. Overall, a pretty good beer and one that I might get again.","HattedClassic","Jan 02, 2014"

4.32,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in January 2009 (pushing 4 years old). Cork blew off as soon as I untwisted the cork, no beer was lost to gushing. Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge tart apple, lemon zest, orange, pear, strawberry, hay, grass, barnyard funk, earth, herbal, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange zest, hay, grass, earth, herbal, pepper, funk, and light yeast spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, citrus, grass, hay, pepper, funk, earth, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale with brett added! Awesome flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. An incredibly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 31, 2012"

Taste comes off with alot of refined brett with spicy Belgian yeast with some bitterness on the end. Not all that sour, I could not say this is even tart, more like a saison with brett in taste and feel. Confluence has a mediumish feel with active bubbles off the tap.

Light aroma, grassy, flowery, with tones of light fruits: pear, peach, white grapes. The taste follows the smell, with a light fruitiness--pear, peach, white grapes, apple skin--not too thick or overbearing, grassy with a touch of funk, and hints of spicy yeast. Light mouthfeel, pretty dry in the finish, and quite drinkable overall, but not overly flavorful, and I do like my wild ale to be loaded with flavor.

You get a lighter bodied Belgian spice all around with a slightly dry finish. The brett is there but it's not overbearing. It's a lot lighter in body than I imagined. It somewhat hurts the flavor profile since it abbreviates the flavor with a quick finish. It just takes away from the beer as a whole really. That is why overall I'd say it's just ok.

Pours a golden haze with an almost champagne like fizz, building into a tall, fluffy, fortuitous head, the like of which I may have never seen such in the way of the cumulus nimbus. A dense lace coats the glass throughout the session. A floral, slightly citrusy boquet trumpets the aroma with hints of spicy phenols. At this point, the beverage is an impecable belgian offering. Wading through the foam, dryness and crispness arrive and last through the sip, with a floral and lightly pungent mid-body that is briefly noted and requires another sip. And many more. The dryness combined with the bite of carbonation leave a disappointing finish, but with the desire to taste again so as to experience the medley again. Overall, the hopped flavor melds seamlessly with an almost invisible brett tart. While a tad too dry, this is an otherwise perfect beer.","NuclearRich","Aug 16, 2011"

The aroma is very memorable and distinctive as it marries together the Allagash Belgian House yeast and some wild yeast, which emits a flowery, piney, earthy combination.

The taste a little bit of a tart flavor to it but it's actually not too bad. The other flavors are a little floral with just a touch of yeast in there too.

Complex enough and top quality, just a bit short of that hyped complexity. Maybe I expected something slightly different of a wild ale, this felt like a nicely hopped saison with brett. In fact, it reminded me a bit of Boulevards´s Saison Brett, which I find better rounded. I would recommend this one, although under this pricing… Allagash labels this as a Dry Hopped Golden Ale and it feels better suited under that framing.","Daniellobo","Jul 11, 2011"

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall there were some very interesting notes going on in this one. I really had mixed feelings on it.

All that pageantry just led to a letdown when I first leaned in for a smell. It had the aroma of a watered down Allagash Blonde, with just the faintest hint of brett. Where's my funk? The taste brings more balance between the malty sweetness (with a little more earthiness along with the fruitiness of Blonde) and the brettanomyces. I can find just a hint of the black pepper I've been getting from their house yeast strain all night as well. The pieces are in place, but the flavor doesn't really stand out overall, and it could stand to be pushed even a little bit further towards the funk. Best carbonation on any of the Allagash brews I've had tonight though, very nice and lively. Even for a Wild, Confluence seems just a tad watery, but I'm really just splitting hairs at this point. The restrained brett influence (albeit too restrained imo) and the solid execution on Confluence support a nicely flavored beer and make it solidly drinkable.

Very fruity with mango, apricot, melon, and a touch of lime. This fruit is underpinned by a gentle funk that has a characteristic of overripe fruit rather than horseblanket or barnyard. This would probably change substantially with some age. The taste has more apricot up front than in the nose, and here there is also a bit of ripe cheese funkiness, but just a touch. There is a drying note of lime, and some sharp but earthy hops, as well as some dry malt, and a crisp yeast profile. Some deep flavors here, with a dry finish. In the mouth its dry and crisp, but very earthy, and with a bit of fruity sweetness at the end.

The taste is not all that different, spotlighting orange peels, bananas, cloves, a dry slap of bitter hops, and the skin of some mandarin oranges (I have no other way to describe that last one...took me almost ten minutes just to come up with that). Unfortunately for me, the more bitter aspects were what shined through, drowning out the more fruity, sour, wild notes. Overall, it tasted like biting into an orange, peel and all, just before the fruit is ripe.

Otherwise, there's a floral quality and a big earthiness from the Belgian yeast, almost lightly smoky in a dry mushroomy kind of way. Mild, though definitely detectable, hops provide bits of herbaceous, minerals and grass in the finish. The flavor is quite dry. And the feel is mild, though good. Quite drinkable for the abv and for a sour. I'm aging a bottle to see if the sour notes come out more with time.","popery","May 06, 2010"

It has the familiar Belgian yeast flavors a lot of Allagash's beers use. There's a watery blandness though that I just can't shake. Even though there's quite a bit going on, the Brett needs some time to mature and tarten up to compliment the sweet notes. A mild hop backbone pokes through. Resembles a pilsner with a small amount of brett...with a Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy! There is no issues with drinkability on this beer, thats for sure! Overall, it needs a little age...a little dissapointed, but not a bad beer by a long shot! A very solid beer for the Allagash lineup.","ShadesOfGray","Apr 11, 2010"

The aroma was complex and a little queer, leafy/grassy notes, sweet fruits (apples and pears) as well as the must of wild yeast. The flavors were similar with a strong emphasis on the Brettanomyces. The alcohol punch was also quite distinct but the fruit and must helped to conceal it. Earthiness and a good malt backbone helped to balance it all. Some lemon-like citrus notes appeared as it warmed up and the finish was dry and clean but a little awkward.

I love what Allagash does with wild ales, I just wish it were cheaper (along the lines of Jolly Pumpkin).

At times the zesty hop character really comes through quite well; this must have been quite a bit more hoppy when freshly released. It is eminently quaffable with just enough Brettanomyces influence to keep my interest piqued throughout. Definitely a wonderful effort and I like that the Allagash house Brett strain has run rough-shod over the rest of the beer (though that can be nice at times too).

I wouldn't normally mention the price/value of a beer, but these big Allagash brews can run a pretty penny and I almost definitely would not pay the $20+ for this again. That said, it's still an above average and enjoyable beer. Being a recent bottling, it IS still young at this point and I'd like to see how the brett plays out with a couple years in the cellar.

The tastes of this beer are very complex and quite amazing. There is a light to medium body. Overall, I'm quite impressed with this wild ale.

Lots of soft blueberry, sweet malt and a slight bit of sourness. It is a perfectly balanced sour with an excellent flavor. Very drinkable compared to most wild beers I have had.

It's hopped differently (i. e. more, it seems) and takes advantage of a lot of synergies. Just enough balsa-wood consistency of the malt to keep a good, spritely backbone while letting the yeast, Brett and the light yet prevalent carbonation mix it up with a little hop in its step.
