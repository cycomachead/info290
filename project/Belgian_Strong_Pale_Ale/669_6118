Peppery tones and Belgian phenolics are also present. Taste is a bit flat. Not a lot of nuance, but I'm not mad at it either. It's crisp and somehow refreshing for a 10% brew. Quite dry as far as mouthfeel, very tripel-like. Overall a decent example and I'm glad this is readily available here in Spain.","slackattack","Jul 16, 2014"

Fruity, zesty, a bit of banana, grape skins and honey. Reminds me of a mead I made back in 1999 (and continue to cellar to this day). Very heavily carbonated, yet with a round mouth feel, two fingers and terrific lacing. Flavors linger and slowly fade on the middle of the tongue. There are some solids in the deep golden brew, but it's mind over matter as this beer warms the belly with the obviously present, yet somehow balanced alcohol. What a treat!","Sipchue","Dec 21, 2012"

Pours fairly hazy and cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge lemon, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, herbal, floral, grass, earth, pepper, honey, and spicy yeast esters. Damn nice aromas with very nice complexity and balance. Taste of big lemon, lemon zest, apricot, pear, pepper, apple, grass, honey, earth, herbal, floral, coriander, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, earth, herbal, floral, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of malt sweetness and spicy esters; with a nice amount of complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel as expected, and fairly crisp on the finish. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 10%, with only a warming noticed well after the finish. Extremely easy to sip on, with good smoothness. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong pale ale(even though I saw this as more of a tripel). Great flavor complexity, balance, and smoothness.

Poured a hazy, dull, orange-gold with a four inch, dense, creamy, off-white head. Head slowly collapses into a one inch, frothy, bubble white mass with thick concentric bands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is pretty boozy - I can smell the alcohol from two feet away. Once you get past that initial quality, there's an earthy/spicy character, as well as citrus and prunes. Taste follows nose. Booziness begins to dissipate as the beer breathes, lots of prunes and candi sugar here. Mouthfeel is medium, with a pleasant, lively carbonation and a slight viscosity/slickness.

As the beer warms a bit, the smells hinted at in the nose bloom into something else when the alcohol comes in. It's very deep and warming, adding a layer of caramel malt that was not originally detected in the nose. Very honey-like. It tastes delicious. It reminds me incredibly of champagne, as well as mead, though it seems less one-dimensional than most champagnes/meads I've had. This has spice and kick, and a great sweet warmth that the carbonation takes right off your tongue so it does not become too cloying.

Same in the flavor, with some buttery (not diacetyl notes). Sweetness is very nicely balanced by the hops, though no hops detectable in the flavor. I get some honey notes as well, which usually comes when the paler strong beligians have some age on them. noticable alcohol flavor at the end but i wouldnt call it a burn. the alcohol is the only thing preventing the 4.5 on taste. finishes kind of dry. medium to high carbonation. a sipping beer, but not hard to drink at all.

I have had the opportunity to try a Malheur Brut from a friend in the MJ Rare Beer Club so I was super excited when I saw this on the shelf for a reasonable price. This bottle conditioned strong golden ale pours out a glowing gold with a very slight haze. Heavy yeast sediment was left in the bottom of the bottle (initially). A thick quilt of airy, snowy white foam lay on top as it leaves traces of its remnants on the side of the glass. My Chimay chalice keeps a solid layer of foam the entire glass. A slightly peppery and yeasty aroma lifts from the glass. The nose is not super strong on this one, but it almost seems appropriately subdued. The flavor speaks for itself on this one. The sugary sweet and dry flavors match wonderful against the yeast presence. A strong finishing hop presence reminds you of the bitterness as it seems to blend so well with the other flavors. The heavy carbonation and bottle conditioning lends a creamy and delicate mouthfeel. An almost floral softness is balanced with a slight metallic feel. This is textbook strong golden ale at its finest. The popularity of Duvel and Delirium seem to overshadow all the wonderful goldens out there, but that is just fine with me. A gem like this should be enjoyed -and moderately with the 10% abv - and shared with those whom appreciate a lovely Belgian Ale in its finest form.","ALESwhatCURESya","Aug 19, 2008"

The smell is of light Belgian candi sugar, tart green apple, and a touch of Belgian yeast/barn yard funk aroma. The taste starts off sweet with the candi sugar and has the typical Belgian yeast characteristics. This is followed by champagne like flavors. There is a hollow hop flavor and a noticable tartness in the end to round out the brew. At 10%ABV the alcohol is well hidden. The feel is fairly light and quite fizzy; again champagne like. The carbonation and tart flavors leave the palate on the dry side. Looks like a heady tripel but drinks like a BSPA and the high ABV is well hidden. It could use more of a Belgian yeast presence to add some needed flavor but overall a good brew. I'm going to cellar a few to see what the effects are.","Gmann","Jan 18, 2008"

The tall head leaves a fine sheet of Belgian lacing in the tulip glass. The nose is quite lively - slightly floral, sweet honey and contains a bit of citrus as well. The palate is dead-on with sweet malts, floral hops and honey throughout. A pleasant sourness arises later on the palate. Mouth feel is medium and quite smooth, with some lingering alcohol in the back of the mouth. Finishes slightly alcoholic and acidic, but is really quite well-balanced for the most part.

Husky, thick, and distressingly bland in flavor. Rough grains and hop bitterness up front give way to a muted lemon and powdered yeast center. Builds strong alcohol fruitiness and burn eventually, but you'll hardly notice this until the end of the glass since it builds so slowly. Beer is rich, almost chunky in the mouth despite a careful pour to avoid the yeasts. Drinks easily only because it's bland.

Malheur 10 had that classic Pilsner float appearance down pat. The aroma was mild with a lemony and floral scent promising a subtle puch to come, so on to the first sip I went. The taste sweet, tart, earthy, and a little more bitter than anticipated. There was a lot of interplay between the dry, fully attenuated malt, the dusty yeast, and aged hops. The peppery hot alcohol was a lot more up front than the likes of sneaky Duvel, and there were no pretensions on this being a beginners drink. Mouthfeel was medium full and warming. This was a classy golden ale all the way. I will now be picking up more of their offerings, as one 330 ml bottle just won't do.","rajendra82","Aug 13, 2007"

You'll get a nice cloudy orangy yellow with a very thick and frothy white head that retains and retains. The lacing is about as thick and long lasting as any you'll find. The smell is candied sugars, sweet malts, tangy fruits, and cloves. The taste is a burst of orange, full bodied, strong, sweet malts, typical Belgian candied sugars, some citrus, a bit of a yeast punch in the middle, a creamy mouthfeel, and an aftertaste that is warming alcohol and more lingering yeast. The downside is probably the aftertaste. That lingering, sweet, alcoholy yeastiness is what typically gives me heartburn if I have too many. L'Chaim","albern","Aug 09, 2007"

I also see bits of yeast floating around in the glass and a strong, steady stream of carbonation rising up in the middle of the glass. The aroma is a pleasant spicy orange/peach aroma with hints of citrusy yeast and a smooth malty scent. The taste aptly follows suit, presenting heavy spice and orange and peach flavors. Also notable is a strong honey presence which balances the fruitiness quite well and mellows the whole thing out. Man, what a tasty beer this is. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a slight citrus tang. On the whole, this beer is highly drinkable. Forget the high alcohol (10% ABV) and just dive in.

Nothing suprising about the beer--smell and taste--and you'll get the same elegant sensations in nose and mouth. Very fruity, apple like Budweiser but good, and yeast characteristic.

3.96,-0.3,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Golden color with a huge, rocky, creamy head, many bubbles everywhere, going berserk, rising and falling having a good time. Big malt taste, alcohol, spiciness, fruity, yeasty. Not a lot of aroma, sweet, jellylike, fruity. Beer has lots of triple qualities. Very drinkable and tasty eer. Only prolem was that it was a tough pour with yeast all over the glass ut this did not take anything away from ther taste.","kennyo","Oct 05, 2004"
3.9,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Cloudy golden hue, white foam becomes a ring with nice belgian lace. Coriander spiced lemon pie aroma. Hay, cream, meringous, herbal, fruit esters (apple, pears). Very yeasty spicy palate, lots of coriander, cloves and pepper attack the tongue gently. Mostly sweet and alcoholic unfortunately with a light earthy grassy bitterness touch in the finish. Well defined fluffy/foamy mouthfeel from the high carbonation. Overall, it's pleasant enough to deserve high marks despite the few aspects I would change, it remains rather complex with well defined fruits and balancing bitterness unlike many poorer examples.","Rastacouere","Sep 07, 2004"
3.35,-15.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,"The head didn't look too bad but it faded a bit quickly.The body is of a yellow golden color with lots of things in suspension. The smell is very dry and fruity, reminding me of fresh straw and white wine. The taste is dry and acidic, quite mouth puckering. Too much alcohol for me in there. Yeasty, light and aired, and very citric. Quite grassy too. Spicy and pepery. In spite of the dryness of the taste, the mouthfeel has a creamy character; I appreciated this combination. But I can't say that this beer is drinkable. 25cl is already too much for me.","tjd25","Jun 29, 2004"
4.18,5.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a good beer. Poured with a THICK foamy head. Cloudy golden color. The glass presentation is great. Smells good, but I can't pick out any individual aromas. Nice flavor. You can't tell that you are drinking such a strong beer. There is some taste that I just can't describe that lingers after you swallow. Smooth going down. Definitely could knock back a few of these in a row. I would buy this beer again.","Hex92","Mar 30, 2004"
3.78,-4.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Bottle: Poured a golden colored beer with a nice thick head. Aroma is quite hoppy and floral. Taste is also hoppy and floral with a hint of citrus (lemon, orange) with a bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden which Im starting to believe is a Belgian miracle. Good carbonation with standard body. Makes me want to investigate more beers from this brewery.","Phyl21ca","Feb 22, 2004"
3.65,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottled 3/01. Best by 3/29/04. Looks like I was a day late! Gushed furiously upon opening the cork. Lost about 100ml of the 750ml. Fluffy, porcelain white head covers a hazy pale amber hued brew. Frothy, rough lace remains. Animated, dusty yeast aggregates in suspension. Green apple tartness offset by ripe, sugary peach upfront in aroma. Musty, sourdough like yeast presence. Becomes more vibrant in aroma as it breathes, with understated fermented pineapple and raw honey notes arising. Quirky, yet inviting aromawise. In flavor, the initial banana bread sweetness yields to a combination of honey dipped black licorice and clove. Sweetness reemerges promptly, albeit in a tracely cidery, light candi sugar nature. Bitterness is soft overall, but there remains a sharp, pithlike tinge. Overshadowed, underripe honeydew melon like tartness. Moderate in body, with a lightly syrupy, but not cloying mouthfeel. Finishes simply sweet with an abrupt minerally twang. Ethanol warmth pokes through the residual sugar after a several second deliberation. Perhaps not an ideal brew for aging, but it's nonetheless a fine, satiating brew. It lacked the dangerous briskness of many fine "tripels". I'd love to try this near the source.","marc77","Oct 26, 2003"
4.03,1.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"This was from one of the 750 mL bottles that was designated MM for the millenium. It has a big head and a spicy, hoppy aroma. THe body is light and refreshing and it finishes crisp and dry with the taste of fresh lemon zest. A spectacular beer, but I feel that drinking too much of this in a sitting would not be a good thing because it goes down so easily and packs quite a wallop.","ark57","Oct 19, 2003"

Somewhat like a Grand Cru.. Finish: Crisp, drying. Drinkability: Surprisingly easy-drinking for a 10% beer.","saltydog","Jul 20, 2003"

4.4,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"750 ml bottle cellared for 2 1/2 years (technically past the expiration date by 3 months). The initial glass is fairly clear, but it becomes quite hazy with subsequent pours as the rising carbonation stirs up the yeast sediment. A tall head of bright-white foam rises up over the golden-orange body as if it wants to escape from the glass. The retention is excellent, and it maintains a short, creamy cap and leaves some fairly solid sheets of lace throughout the entire glass. The nose is sweet with a light note of vanilla, a low-key fruitness, some peppery spiciness (alcohol?), and a surprisingly bright hoppiness! It's initially gently zesty on the tongue due to the combination of it's exceptionally fine and natural carbonation and light/medium body; but it becomes more cottony and lightly creamy as it warms across the palate. The flavor delivers everything that the aroma promises with some lightly fruity and sweetish malt up-front; a softer maltiness and floral hop flavor across the middle; solid, rising bitterness towards the swallow; and a distinctly dry and bitter finish that's heightened by a wash of peppery, drying alcohol. It lingers in the mouth with hot and peppery alcohol amidst the occasional reminder of sweet, honeyish malt or floral hops. It's quite charming, and leans towards a dangerous level of drinkability although the alcohol is noticeable enough to let you know what you're getting yourself into! Most likely worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Feb 08, 2003"

4.15,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Cloudy lemon yellow color on the pour, the head creamy in texture and immoderate in size, the residual lace a fine satin sheet to seal off the glass. Crisp and fresh citrus like tones begin the nose, orange peel, and malt, lightly sweet and quite pleasant to sniff. Big sweet malt start, with a tartness that hits you at the top which is skinny in feel, finish "Vinous", slightly sour, quite dry, biting acidity, a fine beer in its own right, drinkable and worthy of a try at least.","Gusler","0"
4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Hazy gold with a white head that lingers to the bottom of the glass. The smell is a bit citrusy with hints of peach and noticeable yeast. The taste is delightful, full of peachy flavors and a bit of musty, horsy flavor. The mouthfeel is wholly satisfying and quite carbonated. Despite the 10% abv, it's dangerously drinkable.
