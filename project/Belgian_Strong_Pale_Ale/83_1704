It's a bit dangerous as it disguises its 8.5% ABV quite well. Approximately AU$120 for a case of 24 x 330mL - I'll have to have a 4-pack every now and then, as I am but a pauper.","SmashPants","Dec 02, 2014"

3.85,-4.2,4,4,3.75,3.5,4," The taste brings a nutmeg-like woody spice with pear and mild nutty malt with light tangy yeast balanced by a slight alcohol creeping in mid palate wtih subtle wheat sweetness and toasted flavor with a bit of pepper and some other indistinct spice w/ date and light sweet caramel w/ warming accent of sugar in the finish which has a flavor of alcohol drying the palate. This is a very good ale, better than I expected but a little strong alcohol-wise in the taste with heavy yeast and spice with some grain in the taste, but enjoyable in general with nice combination of yeast and spice.","Slatetank","Aug 13, 2014"

I wish I had synesthesia that operated by taste somehow instead of sounds or words. This is the closest I have found to it. Bought a bottle at the Seibu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. At Seibu, Hoegaarden is ranked as the top-selling beer. However, I noticed this Grand Cru standing on the shelf above it neglected yet inviting. I took it home, ripped its clothes off, and drank it with a passion. It poured into a pilsner glass wonderfully, creating a nice thick white head. The aromas dancing off this brew were out of this world -- fruity and hoppy and like how I imagine pixies smell. The taste was how I imagine pixies taste. Fully of earthy tones that have been doing The Bump with fruits from enchanted forests. I couldn't put this brew down. I couldn't stop, and I won't stop.

Bottle from the Land of the Rising Sun and survived the earthquake, tsunami, and radiation while he made his way back to the United States! Best before 20/05/12. Served from bottle into a Grolsch Pilsner. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one and a half finger very slightly off-white head that subsided to half a finger quickly. Maintained minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, mild banana, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall I was surprised by this one. It was a little harsh on the alcohol as compared to the regular version of this brew as you can imagine. The flavor profiles seem to be the same, but everything is stepped up a notch on this one to make it much more intense. I had this one on my Wants list since I joined BA (1 year ago today!) and finally got to tick it! Really glad I got the opportunity and really appreciate the effort Jerriko went through to get this to me.","thagr81us","Apr 28, 2011"

There is also some sweet bread and citrus flavors blended in there. There is a good full feeling in my mouth, much like light cream or buttermilk.

It had a cloudy orange color with a fountain of carbonation and tons of floating yeast. The head was good sized and slowly settled to a 1/4" constant foam that was constantly replenished by the carb. The aroma was the usual fruity and spiciness of a wit with a solid coriander smell. The smell was also dry which matched the finish. The taste was pretty good but had an aftertaste that I couldn't identify but didn't like. I like my Wits a little more fruity than dry but this was one wasn't too dry.

The beer poured a bright golden color with a active carbonation body into a snifter and had a nice fluffy white head. The aroma had some very present hop nose with some good citrus tones. The taste was an enjoyable mix of citrus hops bite and a touch of sweetness to round things out, all lined by some spice from the present alcohol touch.","ggaughan","Jun 25, 2006"
3.77,-6.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"M&D: softly carbonated and medium bodied, this beer is quite easy to drink. Somehow it's in line with the styles of Tripel or Strong Pale Ale, minus the assertive, perfumy fruity edge. A rather understated and mild pale ale, very approachable~~","wl0307","Jun 16, 2006"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Hoegaarden Grand Cru pours an opaque orangy gold color, with little head or lacing. Smell is of medicinal phenols and bright tropical fruits. Taste is very nice with some peppery spice showing up in the beginning, then mroe light fruit characters such as orange, banana, pear....many more im sure that Im not getting. Not too much carbonation, but the hop presence gives this beer one hell of a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Alcohol is hidden very well, I never really realized how well until now. Sip after sip, all I want is more, one is simply not enough for me, maybe a few. This is a fantastic beer. Although I haven't sampled a wide variety of Witbiers, this one comes through for me with flying colors. Also, although people have complained that this one is too similar to its counterpart, I still firmly believe that it exceeds it and is certainly worth picking up. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 31, 2006"

4.37,8.7,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Regular Hoegaarden is one of my favorites, so this was a treat to find. This pours with a very generous head, and the effervescing of the bubbles never seems to stop. The smell is very citric with a hint of wheat much like the original. The taste is not what I expected: it is much less sweet than regular Hoegaarden or Hoegaarden Speciale. It is almost as if the lemon is taken out to make way for a more serious-tasting beer. If you are a fan of a witbier without the traditional citrus, then this is for you.","Toddv29424","Mar 16, 2005"

The smell is very enjoyable, yeasty and wheaty with some straw, a hint of fresh tomato and a light hint of bacon. Fruity, very lightly citric. The taste is decent, more grapefruit than in other witbiers, nicely floral too. My only reason to complain is that the 8.5% abv become a bit too noticeable. Mouthfeel is good, creamy, smooth and round. The high alcohol content and the way it's poorly hidden reduce the drinkability of this beer.","tjd25","Jul 19, 2004"

It pours a hazy thick orange with an explosive carbonated white head that maintains itself to an eighth inch all glass long, while a trail of lace is left behind. The aroma is floral, with stong citric notes of lemon zest and orange peel. The taste follows the citric path while bringing out more zest with tastes of tropical banana, a sweet malt and soft hop. A soft foamy mouthfeel swirls the taste giving no hint of the 8.7 abv that provides a slight gentle warming. An excellent, non-intrusive must try brew.

I went to use the restroom and when I came back (yes, I did wash my hands, thank you) the head was bigger. Very nice appearance, very elegant and sparkling, although heads so large that you get nothing but foam for the first few sips irritate me. They do look good though. Back to the beer, the coriander is subdued, a bit more orangey here. The wheat/malt is bigger here and appropriately this is a heavier beer. I get a little oats in the flavor. The mouthfeel is slick and the tiniest bit thick. Good beer but something about it gives it lower drinkability than the looks would suggest.","aracauna","May 11, 2003"
