3.99,23.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"From a 330ml brown bottle. Bought at the SAQ. Nice copper colour with a beige thin head. Nose with a nice mocha nose, with some nuts. Good taste of malt, some alcohol, nice equilibrium. I drank this beer 10 years ago and it was disapointing now it's a very good beer.","rodenbach99","Aug 25, 2010"
3.68,13.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a deep, dark reddish brown, with a few fingers of puffy, off white head, that melts away, leaving no lacing. It smells of sour grape essence, and mildly sweet malt. It tastes of sweet wood flavours, citrus, grape must, and caramel malt. The carbonation is quite mild, and the alcohol not really noticeable, just a slight warming. This finishes smooth, with the brandy edge holding on for a little while. A pretty interesting and natural pairing of French beverages, that, while being a blend instead of an aged in wood product, produces similar impressions as those offerings from Innis & Gunn and BrewDog.","biboergosum","Mar 04, 2009"
2.53,-21.9,4,3.5,2,2.5,2,"I love both cognac and beer and beleive blending them or perhalps aging beer in cognac barrels is a good idea. I don't feel the base beer used here is the best one for this combination.","bloberglawp","Jan 25, 2009"

4.03,24.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer gets an unfairly bad rap. First off, it's a weirdie right off the bat, as it's an orange/amber beer blended with actual Cognac. If you don't like Cognac (or any Brandy), don't try it! You won't like it. It's Cognac beer. For those that are interested, read on... it pours nicely, its head isn't remarkable, but not unacceptable. Very pronounced cognac nose. I must have had a fresh bottle - the beer tasted fresh, and the balance was better than most reviews had me believing. Cognac taste is very present, of course, but it's still a beer. Smooth and drinkable, pleasant. Alcohol was not overly pronounced. Excellent alternative to a port or cognac after dinner, or with a cigar or dessert. I find it's similar in spirit to Innis & Gunn. I'd recommend it for those who like ports and cognacs.","forceten","Apr 07, 2008"

3.54,9.3,4,5,2.5,4,3.5,"I tried this beer on August 17, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe' in Toronto. The beer poured into a tulip glass a beautiful reddish brown colour with almost no head. The aroma was cognac, malt, alcohol and burnt butterscotch. The mouthfeel was very very smooth with a medium body and some mild carbonation. The taste was very heavy on the cognac, and a little hint of fruit. I did feel the alcohol burn, and for a beer with an 8% abv, that's not good in my book. A little pricey at $14.25/bottle as well when I can visit some other places and get an Abbey Quadrupel for less.","cyrenaica","Aug 17, 2007"
3.92,21,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Truth be told, this biere-du-garde-type base beer, while not a perfect match, does little to hinder the cognac, except with regards to regulating its alcoholic intensity and remodeling it for slightly larger, more casually quaffed sips - both of which are positive amendments for my purposes. Still, however, the beer by and large retains much of the balance and delicacy, the sublime serenity, that characterizes even the youngest of France's cognacs.","biegaman","Apr 11, 2007"

1.56,-51.9,3.5,2.5,1,1.5,1,"Bottle: decants a brilliant clear garnet with amber hilights...not much of a cap even from a hard pour. Aroma is perfumey, some grape with some sweet treacle tones. Starts sweet with some molasses tastes then you catch the dry grapes and the alcohol takes over the palate for the rest of the ride to the finish. The finish is alcohol pronounced and warming...this is more like a cocktail or mixed drink than a beer....not to my liking...wont revisit. Rye and coke is more palatable","pootz","Dec 04, 2004"

3.46,6.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"That said, while I enjoyed this beer, I think you need to use it it the right place. Definitely not something you want to knock back a lot of in short order. You wouldn't swill a cognac, so I'd suggest treating this beer the same way. Sip at it and enjoy it slowly after dinner.","TerryW","Jan 15, 2004"

2.06,-36.4,3,2,2,2,2,"Weird beer! - but then, mixing cognac in beer IS a weird idea! The result: Aroma and flavour neither of beer nor cognac - but of RASPBERRIES!! and boysenberries. Rather sweet, but not as sweet as the aroma makes you fear. Not really godawful, but definitely not a beer I'll buy again. Beer is beer, and cognac is cognac - and never shall the two meet (again)!","Sigmund","Nov 21, 2003"
