To be honest, the price point is attractive and can provide a cheap buzz, but not one to seek out for BA's imho.","blackcompg","Oct 16, 2014"

It pours a clear copper (go figure) topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty-white foam. The nose is almost entirely composed of buttery biscuits, though some very light grass and flowers vainly attempt to muddle their ways through to the 'strils as well. The taste goes in a different direction, opting for a melange of caramel, mandarin orange syrup, light maple syrup, candi sugar, and a touch of mint in the background. Gotta say, this ain't the best taste in the world... The body is the heaviest light-medium possible, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a sub-standard brew, one that's having me question my earlier beer opinions...","TMoney2591","Beers"

3.68,9.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think it's a good beer. They balanced the sweetness and spiciness just right to make this a good brew. Some good hop bitterness at the end takes place. Give this beer a shot, it'll be well worth it.","necoadam","Jan 11, 2004"
4,19,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent with a slight hop aroma. The taste is good. It is a smooth, yet awfully malty beer with little complexity, but full of flavor. It warms at the finish. It boasts of many pale malts and other low lovibond malts that add a slight orange hue to it's appearance along with added malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It drinks well; a fine strong ale.","WesWes","Dec 03, 2003"

4,19,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured deep amber with a massive tan head that retained and laced rather well. Aroma was sweet, malty with a bit of spice and alcohol. Tastes of malty alcohol, caramel and more spice. Hops were barely present and the malts dominated to the end of a smooth finishing beer. Very different, but also very good.","dpend","Sep 18, 2003"
3.31,-1.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"This rather strong ale is a copper/amber color with a thin white head and some trailing lace. The aroma is a mix of doughy malt and alcohol, with a faint smell of apples. The body is somewhat sweet and herbal, with a touch of toasted white bread. The hops are hard to define as they are masked by alcohol esters. Upon not so careful tongue smacking and breathing in through the mouth (Kathy's sleeping...I hope), a lemony sour flavor and lightly metallic tang can be detected. It seems a bit stronger than it's 9.1% ABV indicates","BeerResearcher","Aug 11, 2003"
3.55,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It has a highly viscous mouth and is almost caramel like. The character of the beer only comes out after it reaches a fairly high temperature, so leave it out of the frige to get the most pout of the beer. Aout one a night is enough at this level, maybe sharing a snifter is best.","DarrellK","Jul 19, 2003"
3.32,-1.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This medium bodied strong lager has a medium orange color. Large head. The aroma is fruity, pears and peaches. It definitely has a high alcohol content; its the first thing you taste, then comes the near cloying sweetness. The malts are caramel and toffee. The hops are spicy. Its way over balanced and the taste is all over the place. The flavor beats the hell out of most malt liquors and if you are looking for a quick buzz, this stuff is a good choice. Interesting beer, not sure I can recommend it; the flavor battle makes it worth trying once. The buzz is fairly clean, Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is harsh and alcoholic. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Apr 24, 2003"

3.45,2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"9.1% from Poland...is this gonna taste good? hmmmm.....well it's a clear amber in color with a small and nicely coating head. The aroma is sweet malts and alcohol, plain and simple. Flavors? Try chewy maltiness on a parade down your throat with alcohol as a sidekick, or shall I say cohost? Super malty and very warming alcohol. It's kind of pleasant though. And what do we have here?....a spicy hop kick to compliment the warm alcohol finish! Well that was a nice accent on a very boozy brew. It keeps it in line and I ended up enjoying it, even though I didn't have much of a tastebud or palate left after 3/4ths was consumed. Drinkability is down for the simple fact that one is enough......not a bad brew, surprisingly enjoyable to me.","AudioGilz","Feb 23, 2003"
4.15,23.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This is one cool, boozy-assed beer that I will definitely buy again. It gets better as you go, and I wish I had another right now! Tastes like a mixed drink. Malty, tangy taste, but dominated by the alcohol. Despite this, quite drinkable, and definitely warming. Kind of like a cousin to EKU 28. The ABV IS NOT well hidden here! This is, I'm sure, exactly what it is intended to be, but is relatively easy to drink and packs a helluva whollup!","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 13, 2003"
3.63,8,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a clear, light amber (golden) color with creamy white foam that left a nice coating down the glass. The smell is good: hops with a bit of malt. The taste is dominated by hops (floral and bitter) with some malt sweetness in the background. The hop bitterness lingers long on the tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, dominated by the hops, but with a bit of a "soapy" aftertaste. Medium body. The drinkability is OK, but there is not quite enough malt to balance the hops, in my opinion.","UncleJimbo","Dec 30, 2002"

A bit syrupy on the feel. Sweetness lingers. Slick feel. Must be the 9.1% abv, but I really didn't notice the alcohol taste. A wierd beer indeed, but still tasty.","StevieW","Nov 30, 2002"
3.9,16.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Not bad at all....a little better than I expected, to be honest. The beer is a rich brown-to-amber color. It has a densely packed head that doesn't really last very long. The aroma is malty and grainy. Taste is initially sweet and somewhat woody. The beer hides its alcohol content very well...in the taste as well as the aroma, although there is little warming as you get to the bottom of the glass. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Finish is slightly metallic and at times the beer is a bit astringent. All in all, it was enjoyable.","Suds","Nov 18, 2002"
3,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"As it sits in the glass, limpid amber in color, the head immense in it size, frothy consistency with oodles of fine lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt, somewhat musk, or moldy if you like with a quite sweet start and middling top. The beer finishes with a strong acidic bite, purposeful hop presence, and a alcohol bitter dry aftertaste. The high ABV warms the tummy and makes this a bit more robust than I would have thought.","Gusler","Aug 16, 2002"
1.62,-51.8,4,2,1,3,1,"Call me a naysayer. But my worries started as soon as I saw the 9.1% ABV on the bottle. I've tried a few of the other Polish imports over the last few weeks, and my experience has been that they tend to pack in far more alcohol than the complexities of their beers would warrant. If this was going to be anything like the Pilsners I'd had, 9.1% was just too much. But I gave it try. Poured a nice copper color, with a thin uneven head which soon dissipated to a fine lace top. The aroma is alcohol, a hint of malt, and not much else. The flavor. I tried it cold. I tried it warm. I kept trying it even though each sip made me shudder. Earthy and medicinal and intensely alcoholic. Like someone crumbled up some hop leaves in rubbing alcohol and served it in a glass. There's a bit of malt sweetness to it, but even the sweet tastes in this beer manage to come off rather harsh. Hugely astringent aftertaste. I'm a fan of strong beers -- barley wines, Stone's Double Bastard, you name it. But at least two thirds of this beer went down the drain. I only hope the EPA doesn't get on my case for polluting the sewers.","mzwolinski","Jun 09, 2002"
4.05,20.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Tawny copper color with an off-white head that thins to a collar but leaves no lace. The aroma is of sweet malt, esters, a light but sharp hop, and some alcohol. Full bodied with a tight effervescent carbonation that is zesty on the tongue at first, but becomes quite creamy once warmed in the mouth. The flavor is of rich, straight-forward malt combined with an earthy & spicy hop flavor (a real nice blend of flavors at mid-palate) backed by a solid bitterness. The finish is quite hoppy and shows the alcohol readily, leaving an almost minty flavor in the finish along with some honeyish sweetness. Somewhat sticky but bitter as well. An extra-strong, deep golden lager that is richly malty, hoppy and enjoyable, but not complex.","NeroFiddled","Apr 05, 2002"
3.15,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Hevelius Kaper:  named after the “astronomer and brewer.”  In a 17.52 (?) ounce brown bottle, with 9.1 percent alcohol.  Very deep brown color, with a pure white head.  Rich malt flavor, and alcohol warmth. Very nice for $1.29 a bottle, an after dinner drink, not for frying up the polish sausage (as I was doing).","jackndan","Beers"
3.16,-6,4,3,3,4,3,"Whoa! Is right...Heavy alcohol taste throughout this brew, along with some light notes of malt sweetness and hints of spiciness. Nothing balancing this brew out though, very one sided. Overall not too shabby...Very nice looking bottle though...","WilliamPhilaPa","0"
