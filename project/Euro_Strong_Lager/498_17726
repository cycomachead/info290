2.21,2.3,4.25,2.5,2,1.5,2,"Final Grade: 2.21, a D grade. Bavaria Red is not the sort of beer that should be reviewed. Typing equals time, and once this beer gets warm you might as well pour it down the sink. It's drinkable when ice cold, and from my time served at that liquor store in Edmonton, it would seem that this beer also has the homeless person market cornered. The regular 8.6 is a slightly better beer, and that is not saying very much because they're both atrocities.","thehyperduck","Sep 28, 2013"

I wonder what.... but this is Panama and everything here comes by crate. When one asks the question, "Who is John Frum?" I am reminded of this beer. Quite frankly this can knocks out a local, but honestly and in a very well intentioned-good-natured way....they don't know no better.","mndlssphlsphr","Nov 06, 2012"

1.46,-32.4,3,2,1,2,1,"Deep red colour, collar of white/off white head, not much in the way of lace. Smell is a mixture of malt and sugar, some fruit is present, but very sweet smelling almost candy like notes mixed with alcohol. The taste is a awful mixture of malt and sugar, some cherry taste and rocket fuel like alcohol...just terrible. Medium carbonation, syrupy and thick feeling, med-full body. This was just horrible, no person should ever have to drink this, I barely got through 1/4 of the tall can before this saw the drain, avoid at all costs.","peensteen","Dec 09, 2011"

2.15,-0.5,2,2,2.5,1.5,2,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how the flavors picked up a bit after the aroma. Through the nose we were expecting something admittedly offensive to the palate, but rather we were given a darker brew that gave a robustness of flavor that presented as somewhat integrated with the rest of the beer’s components.","TheBrewo","Feb 05, 2011"
3.28,51.9,3,2.5,3.5,4,3.5," I will not give this drink a terrible rating. I have bought this on several occasions, and it is when I am in the mood for a sweet "red" beer. For most occasions however, I would advise something else on the menu.","toomanyideas","Jan 13, 2011"
2.24,3.7,4,2.5,2,2,2,"D - Unique flavours, but the sweetness is just too much for my liking. Alcohol is not hidden, and slaps you around a bit. I would not recommend this to anyone.","andrenaline","Nov 25, 2010"
1.78,-17.6,2.5,2,1.5,1.5,2,"Dr: Buy it to get lambasted if you dare. This is what I politely call a "student beer" - both because it tastes like it was brewed by the brewer's students and because only broke-ass students would drink it. Laughably bad for the style. The price could be worse.","kojevergas","Nov 03, 2010"
2.16,0,4,3,1.5,2,2,"Holy Jebus! What a Jekyll and Hyde of a beer! Looks like one thing, and tastes like one unholy sort of another. It's just hard to reconcile, so attractive on the outside, evil on the inside. Ok, so maybe that's not an altogether uncommon thing. Anyway, this is (to paraphrase a tad) the beer your mother warned you about. Like the aforementioned World Cup stunt, it's all just show, pomp and circumstance - and skanky under the hood.","biboergosum","Oct 20, 2010"
1.98,-8.3,3.5,3,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Overall, this is like malt liquor but more sugary. It's cheap and gets you loaded if you can get through the taste.","CrazyMike","Oct 02, 2009"
1.6,-25.9,4.5,2,1,2.5,1,"D-It's like someone took Robitussin and let it sit in the sun for 8 1/2 hours, then added grain alcohol to it! I'm not sure if I can finish this one. It's a party beer and might appeal to the crowd who just wants to get plastered. I do admit it's a little better with salty food, such as I'm having with this beer in the last bit of this review, but I am not enjoying this. Definitely the worst red I've tried and I won't be getting this one again. Pass! (I ended up dumping the last half of my pint....just couldn't do it)","ChrisCage","Sep 13, 2009"
2.18,0.9,3,2.5,2,2,2,"It is indeed a 'strong lager', but not in any enjoyable way. Reminds me extensively of cheaper beers I bought earlier in my youth, except stronger in flavor.","Seanstoppable","Beers"
2.36,9.3,4,3,2,2,2,"D-Some redeeming qualities, but too sweet. Again, this seems like one of those beers that I'm afraid young kids will get trashed on because of the abv and the sweetness.","BoitSansSoif","0"
2.73,26.4,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,"When all is said and done, this brew is too sweet, although it does have nice qualities and is a worthwhile beverage for the curious. Probably one of the better 500ml import cans available in Alberta. If you don't take this beer too seriously, you might enjoy it.","sammytag","Dec 31, 2008"

2.46,13.9,4,3,2,3,2,"500 ml can from Cafam. Smells like slightly roasted malts and some red licorice with a little caramel. Pours to a bright amber with a 3 finger head with great structure, stands well and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Taste is sharp malts with some bitterness and the AC is most prevalent. Finish is better than the start with some caramel. This seems more like a jump-starter than a a brew. Starts to mellow as it warms up but it still doesn't get there. Mouthfeel is smooth but has a problem getting past the taste. Nothing I'd buy again.","mooseisloose","Mar 29, 2008"
1.75,-19,2,2,1.5,1.5,2,"Pours a bright red with a bleached white cap of decent froth. The aroma is fruity, albiet I'm not one to discern which fruit it is. Maybe some cherries? It's pretty arbitrary. There is also some hay/grass/floral aroma that is tough to place. Tastes sweet, like the candied cherries, red pepper jelly...its sweet and too much so for me. Cloying, and no fucking way I'm drinking this whole can. Liquid dessert gone wrong. Blearrg!","mrmanning","Sep 11, 2007"
1.92,-11.1,4,2,1.5,3,1.5,"Well then, it's been a while since I've done a sink pour, but that's exactly where the last half of this "red strong beer" is headed. Cloyingly sweet to start, with a "bitter beer face" sour finish that can induce intermittent gagging, or at least I'm speaking from personal experience. User results may vary.","IronDjinn","Aug 25, 2007"
1.3,-39.8,2,2,1,1,1,"A beer does not go down well when its reminds you of cough syrup. So i had to push myself to finish it, pity the ratings dont go lower. I'd put 0 for drinkability and 0.5 for taste.","onid678","Apr 30, 2007"
2.34,8.3,4,2.5,2,3,2,"From a ½ liter can, this beer is a deep red color with a decent head. Despite reservations (the pale 8.6 was truly awful), this is an enticing and and attractive looking brew. The aroma, though, brings the goodness to an abrupt halt. Sharp and unpleasant alcohol are the first smell, followed by misplaced fruits. There's a lot of ripe berries and cherry smells, but they're not backed by any malt qualities. Instead, they're lonely and misplaced esters, lost in a sea of harsh ethanol. The taste is intensely sweet, like an over-syruped soda-pop, only with a lot of harsh alcohol. The beer is relatively full in body, and the finish is warm. Despite appearances, this is not a good beer.","Suds","May 19, 2006"
2.41,11.6,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Got me on the serving type - it was one of those new fangled metal "bottles". Anyway, not much head, although a thin cover did last. Has some lace. Color is brown with some red highlights. Aroma was very malty sweet, but caught a whiff of bleach! (not my dishwater, which is filtered plus this glass had it's 3rd beer this time and rinsed) Flavor's just the same. Body is surprisingly thin considering sweetness. Good carbonation helps this beer a lot. Very sweet finish. Two dimensional beer.","drpimento","May 30, 2004"
3.13,44.9,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The nose has hints of raspberry and other red fruits (strawberry?) and of course is fairly sour. The scent develops as it sits. Later on I got a lot of cheese in the nose, like camembert or rocheforte. The flavor is malty and sour  not particularly balanced. The mouthfeel is medium to light with LOTS of carbonation. A little overdone on the carbonation. There was not much lacing to speak of, which could be a product of the carbonation, or of that fact that Parisians dont know how to properly wash their beer glasses.","JulieRFoster","Beers"
1.58,-26.9,2,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"50cl can: This is an amber beer. Clear in color with a HUGE off-white head. The beer is very fizzy. Lots of bubbles clinging to the glass-very much soda like in its carbonation. After the head finally died down I got a whiff: It is sweet. A sugary kind of sweet. Slight caramel to the nose. The sugariness come through in the taste also. No hops to speak of. The sweetness hides the alcohol. Really not that good at all. Its even too sweet for a buzz beer.","Boto","0"
