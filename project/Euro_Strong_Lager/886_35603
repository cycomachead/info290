2.43,-4,2,4,2,3.5,1,"Following the Crack & Glug, I was looking at a finger of eggnog-colored head with very good retention. The beer's color was a hazy, orangish-amber. The nose was honey-sweet, actually very pleasant. I took a trepidatious first sip and was pleasantly surprised by its honey-like sweetness on the tongue. A greater mouthful resulted in a feeling of high heat on the palate, revealing its intensity and giving truth to its "Extra Strong Beer" label. Phew! Fusel was the word. This was the stuff that gives The CANQuest (TM) its legendary status - true questers do not DrainPour, although this was a worthy CANdidate. A clue as to its unpleasantness comes from its French verbiage "Biere Extra Forte". Fortified alcohol is the stuff of hangovers! Extra fortified = extra dry = extra-intense hangover. OMFG! The mouthfeel was medium but I just tasted sugar on the tongue. This was evil! I am sure that it topped out at 9.5 because they aborted the mission. It could have been much dryer and much higher in ABV. Oof. Finish was deadly sweet with a cloying sugary taste that cried out for a glass of water. I'm dyin'.","woodychandler","Oct 23, 2010"
2.46,-2.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Is Gubernija Grand 95 the same beer as Zhiguly Grand? Hard to say, but my scores are strikingly similar. This beer is only recommended if you have an unnatural affinity for boozy, high-octane Euro lagers. One more thing: keep away from open flames.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 23, 2010"
3.18,25.7,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Thanks to resi for the trade.Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and alcohol. Taste is like the smell, alcohol up front, some malts, a bit sweet. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer.","tone77","Aug 13, 2010"

Flavor is like nose but very sweet. A little hop bitter in there plus a bit of tang from the CO2. Also solvents. Body is a full and heavy. Carbonation seems a bit fizzy. Finish is sweet and thankfully not too long. A few swallows is all I want, the rest to the drain.","drpimento","Jun 28, 2009"

3.13,23.7,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pleased with this beer. Found it in a liquor store near O'Hare that must have been run by some people from Eastern Europe because they had lots of polish, czech, lithuanian beers. Golden to orange in color, probably the orangest beer I've ever seen. Corn groats and hop extract are new ingredients to me. Pretty flavorful, I had no idea Lithuania made such a product; similar to a tripel in flavor but priced much more economically and not really up to Belgian standards. Definitely my go to Lithuanian beer, and although it seems like it is just styled to produce high alcohol, it does have a unique taste. Not much after taste but not much of an alcohol presence either.","bheilman","Feb 13, 2009"

The more I drink this, the more it grows on me...however, after one can, I'd be more than happy to be done with this one. I doubt I'll buy this again, but it's not the absolute worst beer I've had, but it's by far not amongst the best!","ChrisCage","Dec 09, 2008"
2.48,-2,3,2.5,2.5,3,2,"Tasted like it smelled, pretty harsh, the alchohol is not hidden at all. I started drinking these out of the can after a while just so I could get drunk so it would tast better. Stay away from this beer!","GodOfBeer","Nov 18, 2008"
2.52,-0.4,3.5,4,2,1.5,2,"D - I think that what this is is essentially malt liquor for the ghettos of Lithuania and the Baltic nations. This is boozy, heavy, sugary sweet, and hopped like a Czech pils. This is a pretty dag-nasty brew that I'd never buy again.","pmcadamis","Nov 08, 2008"

1.94,-23.3,3,1.5,2,2,2,"It appears that I have stumbled upon a Lithuanian Malt Likka. Hmmm this one is not good, but it is interesting. The beer pours a medium-dark golden yellow into my pils glass with a foamy head that soon becomes a thin film. There is a constant powerful carbonation, and the beer leaves minimal lacing. Aroma? Well it's a strong mix of sweet malts, alcohol, and skunkiness. Not too repulsive but not inviting either. The flavor is like nothing I have ever tasted. You can tell right away that this strong lager isn't brewed to impress, rather it is there to gey yer swerve on. Very sweet and skunky, there is an underlying sweetness that reminds me of bad candy. The strong alcohol content makes itself known, yet it isn't overpowering. Thin, sticky mouthfeel accompanied by a finish that makes me wonder if I just did a shot of liquor. One and out for me on this brew.","kinger","Jun 30, 2008"
1.8,-28.9,2.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,1,"Halfway down the glass and my stomach is starting to punch out at me in protest, wondering what the heck is going on, and what did it ever do to deserve this? Best to make this a sink pour rather than find out what it's like the second time around on the way back up...","IronDjinn","May 12, 2008"
2.31,-8.7,4,3,2,1.5,2,"This strong lager pours an attractive pale golden sheen, with a healthy amount of frothy, soapy white head. The head melts away after a few minutes, leaving a ring around the glass. There is a very grainy, saltine-cracker aroma, with a little malt, consistent for Eastern Euro lagers. The flavor: the glycerine mouthfeel almost overpowers anything else representing flavor that may be there. I had an involuntary shake of my head after my first swig. Good grief. After a few more inadvisable sips, that initial shock wore off, and I could sense some malt, more of that soup cracker essence. The alcohol is, while not overtly influential on the flavor, very present in the weight and finish of this beer. I have to say this beer got mildly tolerable as I masochistically finished it, the alcohol in all likelihood having a big part in that. Not an easy beer to drink, and for the wrong reasons.","biboergosum","May 12, 2008"

3.29,30,2.5,3.5,3,3,4,"D: The best thing about this beer is you really cannot taste the ABV and it has some decent flavor. Not something I would reach for again but a halfway pleasant suprise.","aerozeppl","Jan 09, 2008"
1.08,-57.3,1.5,1,1,1.5,1,"Very light gold pour, with light corn/adjunct sweetness and a big alcohol smell. Taste is malty strong alcohol. Taste gets more like rubbing alcohol and very harsh as you drink it. This is terrible, but what do you expect for $.99 for 16.9 oz? The 9.5% alcohol tastes like double that.","JDV","Jan 05, 2008"

2.83,11.9,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"I purchased this bottle at a local fruit market that doesn't usually carry beer. At 99 cents a bottle and 9.5% ABV, I figured I was getting some bang for my buck. If anything, this is a decent lager with a sweet alcohol kick/burn. The appearance is fine - amber, light head,and moderate carbonation. The taste is sweet, warm, crisp - slight corn and grass notes. The alcohol does not overpower, though. If this wasn't so strong, I could see this as a decent choice for a session beer, but given the strength I'd say this is a novelty. Maybe good as a warmer for a cool fall night. Slight recommendation.","montageman","Jun 24, 2007"
2.62,3.6,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Interesting, but I would not do it again. Throw in a bunch more hops and you might have something. Considering the ABV and how sweet it tastes, the OG must be ridiculous.","shererjt","Jun 01, 2007"
2.94,16.2,2,3,3,3,3,"Pours a hazy golden, bubbly white head rises to the top of the glass, then quickly settles down, no lacing, no retention at all. Smell is very sweet, alcohol, corn, citrus, almost a floral hoppiness to it, not bad for what it is. Taste is very strong, lots of caramel and alcohol, grassy herbal hopping. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, close to flat. Interesting, not as bad as I was expecting. The really low carbonation is kind of a curveball.","Viggo","May 17, 2007"

2.36,-6.7,1,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"A sullied appearance, I wonder if it's filtered? From a glance it would seem there was stuff floating in it. A soap scum for a head. A very sweet aroma, sugary and toxic with the alcohol not too well hidden by any means. A little bit of caramel like lace in there too, it's not offensive by any means. The flavour, likewise, stays quite neutral (despite a slight alcohol burn on the finish). This has enough flavour to avoid the taste of a typical, high octane malt liquor, it comes across more as a poorly made Belgian strong or something. I could come nowhere near close to finishing the can myself (or even with two friends) but it was far better than I expected. It avoids the realm of 'awful' which is all you can ask from a Lithuanian malt liquor I guess.","biegaman","Mar 01, 2007"

2,-20.9,2,2,2,2,2,"Pours out looking like strong urine frmo a dehydrated person. There is no head and if I take the patience to stare at the beer, I'll get a rare bubble popping up every now and then. Smell is big on grain, alcohol, and a weird fruitiness. All of this is echoed in the flavor as well as a presence of artificial banana flavor and medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick, oily, sickly, and sticky. Not terribly drinkable.","goochpunch","Nov 21, 2006"
2.88,13.8,3.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Watery, medium-light body, cloying sweetness and not so pleasant high alcohol content make this a brew that I cannot recommend, nor spend the money on again.","scottoale","Nov 02, 2006"
2.03,-19.8,3,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,"To be more honest for the site, I may come back and try to judge this beer as compared to other malt liquors.

2.32,-8.3,3,3.5,2,2,1.5,"Pours a light golden color with a big airy champagne head that dies quickly. All hops in the nose. Taste is mostly hoppy with a little grass and some yeasty sough dough bread twang. Sweetness balances it out, but it is a dull, characterless sweetness. Highly alcoholic and no effort to hide it. Thin body and a viscous mouth leaving a palate coating thats not in its best interest...Id rather it just left me alone after swallowed. As it warms the slim characters presented at the beginning start to meld together but at the same time losses carbonation which was a redeeming quality. I don't think Ill be pining for another one of these soon but if youre a fan of this style I guess its a okay.","cabsandking","Sep 01, 2006"

I am glad I only paid .99 for this.","walleye","Nov 15, 2005"
2.68,5.9,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Okay, so Zhiguly is a light-bodied, high-alcohol lager from Lithuania. All that doesn't exactly set expectations too high. But for $1.35 I'd say it's worth picking one up, just for the hell of it. If nothing else you can catch a cheap buzz.","VoodooBrew","Sep 02, 2005"
3.35,32.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Zhiguly Grand is honey colored with a large frothy head. However, the retention is weak. The aroma is strong and sweet, similar to a "good" malt liquor, but without those adjunct smells. The taste has a strong, thick lager flavor. Sweetness is rich and honey-like, with a touch of fruitiness. The malt flavor is tempered by mildly herbal hops and an alcohol bite, which increases as the beer warms up. Drinkability is pretty good for a 9.5% lager, I really don't think I'd buy this again, but it's not bad.","Gagnonsux","Aug 18, 2005"

2.88,13.8,3.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Opinion: Well, I have been trying a lot of the cheaper Baltic brews here lately, and this is probably the best one yet. Is that saying anything? Maybe. I don't find it completely objectionable, and perhaps this is because they used SOME hops in it. It would be nicer if there was a more assertive bittering component, but I guess you get what you pay for.","SkeeterHawk","Jun 05, 2005"

3.34,32,4,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability... hmmm... this is a tough one. For what it is, it's fairly well done. There are worse American-brewed malt liquors out there with less alcohol, so I guess that says it all. Nice label too.","NeroFiddled","Dec 10, 2004"
3.25,28.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Taste was pretty good considering that there was little head and not very much bitterness. There was some fruitiness that I detected which complimented and hid the high amount of alcohol in this beer. If I had to choose between this and the standard macros, I'd actually pick this over Heineken and the like.","Noelito76","May 29, 2004"
3.08,21.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Interesting beverage here from Lithuania. Pours a clear golden yellow with high carbonation amounting in a white head. Nice yeasty aroma with a slight malt hint to it. Has a slight cidery aroma as it warms. Taste is sugary and smooth, low bitterness and a cane sugar aftertaste. This is really smooth and hides that 9.5% well. Not a beer I'd drink everyday but worth a taste.","redmosquito","Beers"
3.85,52.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Good bready aromatics emerge from under the suds quickly gathered in by the deep, brass-colored liquid. Over-ripe stone fruits, cream and blanched almond appear as well. On the palate it is sweetly alcoholic, clean and even-textured with a respectably long, bright finish. Flavors of apricots, pine needles, aluminum and hay appear. I imagine this to be some kind of eisbock, like EKU 28, only without any attempt to infuse it with wood flavors. Not a bad product at all. Very affordable too.","putnam","0"
