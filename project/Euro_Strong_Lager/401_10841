3.5,30.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mild flavor, inoffensive again. Tea like, sweet and grainy, mild bitterness. Pleasant aftertaste, slightly caramelly. Eventually dry in the finish, no hint of the 7% abv thankfully. A+ recommend, dziękuję!","emerge077","Apr 19, 2011"
3.18,18.2,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: At $1.99, this imported Russian beer gave me very little expectation. However, compared to many of the low-priced quantity over quality beers of the U.S., this beer is very well done. Much more enjoyable than a 32oz of Pabst, MGD, or any Coors/Bud product.","jerskine","Mar 18, 2011"
3.24,20.4,3,4,3,3,3,"Overall- For what it is, it's pretty good- A cheap buzz with a tolerable and decent taste. It is really really sweet though, I couldn't drink too many of these.","Derranged","Feb 02, 2011"
2.56,-4.8,4,3,2.5,2,2,"Lots of carbonation evident and the pour produced a rocky finger of fizzy bone-white head with low retention. Color was a beautiful deep golden-yellow. Nose had a Juicyfruit bubble gum-like quality. Mouthfeel was thin, just above watery, with a powerful grapey-fruity taste in the mouth. Oof. It was not as pronounced as in a Minhas offering, but it was mighty dang close. It had a mild fusel heat to accompany the fruitness as though to add to the ... well, I won't say unpleasantness, but it was not a pleasure to drink this beer, either. Finish left a dry, cloying taste in my mouth and I knew that it was a harbinger of the headache/hangover to come. It was cheap, it was paid for and I wanted a beer for the hockey games, so it was not too bad in total. I would not recommend it as a casual drink but as an intriguing beer, it might be worth a try. I spent an evening with it (in total), watching hockey, so as an accompaniment to sports, it makes it. Otherwise, don't bother.","woodychandler","Oct 18, 2010"
2.13,-20.8,3,2.5,2.5,1.5,1,"Only drink this to get drunk, not to savor it. It beats out 40oz of bmc in that regard and it was cheaper.","crossovert","Sep 27, 2010"
2.87,6.7,2.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Overall not bad not great if you like your drinks a little sweet, malty, and Russian then this is for you.","Zoidzilla","Apr 03, 2010"
1.7,-36.8,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,1.5,"Arsenalnoye Krepkoye is a slightly hazy golden lager with a thin white head that vanishes instantly. It has a very sweet aroma like malt extract and maybe corn syrup. It's medium bodied; dusty and gritty with a watery finish. It tastes very sweet, like malt extract in water. I can't really taste the booze, though. This 51 oz. bottle is trouble. I knew it from the moment I saw it and it didn't let me down. The bottle is plastic, which isn't very effective in a brawl. I just see that as a reasonable safety precaution.","yesyouam","Dec 31, 2009"
2.9,7.8,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Drinkability: An overly sweet Euro lager that is typical of this brewery. Not bad, but probably nothing I am going to try again. Worth trying once.","tigg924","Aug 18, 2009"
3.99,48.3,3.5,2,5,4,4.5,"Overall, considering that I am able to get this stuff at a local liquor store for $0.99 per half liter bottle and mainly care about the last three categories, this is a tremendous buy for me! Experienced beer drinkers will likely consider this beer to be average, but many inexperienced drinkers will find this to be a delight.","Olivander","Mar 28, 2009"
3.5,30.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nothing fancy, but drinkable. For a beer that is 7%, this goes down rather easy.","Hibernator","Sep 28, 2008"
2.78,3.3,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"This beer is not terrible but I would most likely not purchase it again. A little too sweet, most likely in an attempt to hide the 7% alcohol. There are better export lagers available.","rugerj","Oct 19, 2007"

3.22,19.7,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thin white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet malty scent. There are no traces of the increased alcohol or any hops. It's clean and crisp. The taste is decent. It has a rich, malty flavor despite it's pale profile. It's quite sweet throughout with just a touch of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium/full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is an average Euro lager. It's way too sweet for me, but I guess it gets the job done for people looking for a quick buzz.","WesWes","0"

3.3,22.7,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Essentially malt liquor, but not all that bad. Coppery, leaning toward amber with a short-lived head. A little thin and astringent at first, but some lightly sugared malt flavor follows. Thins out a bit again toward the end, with a pleasingly clean finish. Alcohol does not do much to announce itself, although you can detect a touch of fusel alcohol if you try. Overall, one of the better in this class that I've had an opportunity to try, and better than any US counterpart malt liquor.","Brent","Sep 03, 2005"
1.78,-33.8,3,2.5,1,2,2,"The taste was better than a skunked beer but not by much. It tasted like a low quality vodka mixed with beer. I even gagged on the first gulp, and my girlfriend thought that it was like a traditional, National, American Lager. Though I think I would rather drink a Miller lite over this one. I would never drink this beer again nor would I recommend this to anyone else.","eze153","Mar 28, 2005"
2.8,4.1,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Anyway, light on flavor and heavy on alcohol. Absolutely nothing impressive, but it's drinkable. Wasn't stinky or nasty. Just not all that great. If i was in Russsia, i could put a few of these down in the absence of anything better. Fortunately, i am able to get much better beer, and i will.","Bonhoeffer","Mar 20, 2005"

3.53,31.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A clean yellow/golden yellow beer. Has a big foamy bright white head that leaves a good lace. The aroma is a sweet grass with a hint of lemon and a light biscuit malt in the background. The flavor starts with a strong rush of alcohol into your mouth. Followed by a light malt sweet and a light hop pricklyness on the back of your tongue.","ybnorml","Beers"
2.58,-4.1,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours a slightly darker shade of gold, with a big fizzy head that disappears quickly. There is, however, some lace clinging to the side here. The smell is alcohol and a touch of rust, whereas the mouth is a bit heavy. The initial taste is a touch sour, alcohol kicking in as we head towards the finish. The aftertaste is sour. I can't find any hops here. Still, it is not repulsive, as many Russian strong beers are...","Globetrotter","0"
