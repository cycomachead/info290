2.61,-17.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"I'm getting tired of these non-malt lickah types being labelled as such (stupid laws and whatnot...at least, I think that's the reason, right...?). Oh well. This stuff pours a clear golden straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises corn syrup, white bread, sweet honey, light grass, and the vague sense of artificial berries. The taste holds notes of overly sweet corn syrup, booze, hard water, light metal, grass, sweet flowers, and sweet caramel. Just a sweet, boozy mess, frankly. The body is a straight medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, nothing I really wanna ever have again. I've had worse, but I also have nothing truly positive to say about it, either.","TMoney2591","Jun 26, 2011"
2.83,-11,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"The smell was light, nice grain and yeasty bread like smell mixed in with some kinda light fruit, maybe some banana, and a touch of alcohol, but it was pretty standard lager. The taste was like a really strong budweiser. It tasted like your standard fare macro lager, buch just stronger. Typical grain adn yeast, maybe some corn in the flavor. A touch of alcohol.","mikesgroove","May 30, 2011"
3.5,10.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It hides the higher ABV well , which for me is a bonus , however it did nothing to me to distinguish it from the pack of Euro Lagers ( strong or otherwise ) that are available","jarmby1711","Feb 26, 2011"
2.6,-18.2,2,2,3,3,2.5,"O/D - Doesn't taste bad like many of the style. That said it doesn't taste good. Quite mild and bland. Easy to dirnk but why would you want to?","tbeckett","Jan 12, 2011"
3.95,24.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer was in a .5l bottle with a date of 7/10, despite this it was good! Picked up single bottle at a Polish Deli in E. Windsor, CT. Beer had a good flavor, and a nice after taste. Grain and grass hints. Did not taste like hi proof Malt Liquor. Bet it would rock drinking this on tap in Warsaw. Would buy again.","mcwilson04","Nov 27, 2010"

3.1,-2.5,3,3,3,4,3,"Assuming that I am reviewing the correct beer, its better than your average macro American lager, and its a good price. An ok beer, definitely nothing special. If you want a decent, strong reasonably priced and simple beer, this is not bad.","Derranged","0"
2.78,-12.6,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Compared to the previous power is clearly superior (especially in terms of ABV) but oddly enough, alcohol is less felt in the nose, which the drink easier to drink. We find this rather ethereal flavor in aftertaste, with some rather dry herbs. The nose is a Czech Pilsener, mixing both the side of grassy hops and side light, sweet malt, but more powerful.","ThaCreep","Apr 12, 2010"
2.9,-8.8,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"It's drinkable, don't get me wrong. But there's two or three EPL's from Poland that I would put first before this beer.","Syko","Apr 10, 2010"
3.12,-1.9,3,3.5,3,3,3,"All-in-all, pretty much a "run-of-the-mill", average EPL,with less "Euro skunk" and with a bit more strength.","jwc215","Mar 23, 2010"
3.33,4.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is sweet, malts with a touch of hops, pretty tasty. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality beer.","tone77","Jan 21, 2010"
3.6,13.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Surprisingly smooth for such a high ABV. This almost goes down too quickly. Nicely balanced. Glad I found this in one of the local Polish shops.","sunrisesolara","Sep 07, 2009"
3.51,10.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Good "utility" brew. Ideal for replacing macros when gathering with friends for a football game. It WILL sock you in the jaw a little quicker than the average macro too!","BrewMaven","Jan 06, 2009"
4,25.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinks well, I'd like another right now, actually. Not a beer I'd use for pong, if that's what you're after, but this might be awesome for chilling on the porch after a long day. I'll have to track down a place in Denver where I can find it.","imprezawrxsti","Apr 24, 2008"
3.53,11,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall; quite flavoursome for a Euro strong lager. Worthwhile.","JohnfromDublin","Aug 31, 2006"
3.88,22,3,2.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Good beer. Fit for a mountain man? Sure. I would say you could enjoy this on the hottest of days and the coldest. Nice and refreshing but warming at the same time. I am impressed.","brewjones","Feb 02, 2005"
3.06,-3.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Since the previous review the appearance of the can has changed. The dude with the hat now looks a bit more to his left (towards the viewer) and the mostly yellow around the oval label is now black. What's more important, ABV is now 7.0 %. Still, this is a nice beer. It pours a nice golden yellow with a quickly receding head. Smell has some bitterness and sweets in it, as well as a pronounced alcohol, despite the not too high ABV. Taste follows the smell, again the sweet bitterness and clearly present alcohol. My Mom, who brought it from Poland, said that she was warned to check the correct variety. This is the right one! So if you're in Poland this is an excellent beer to have, but don't go through the trouble of importing it.","Regenpak","Beers"
3.46,8.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The beer pours a beautifully clear, orange-kissed gold. A short pile of white froth tops it, settling into a smooth layer atop the brew. Great retention, surprisingly, keeping through the whole half liter. Speckled bits of lace cling here and there. The aroma is laden with creamy, sweet malt, a touch of apple and mild hop spiciness. A touch of floral quality intermingling, both hops and esters. Pretty clean, particularly for the beer's strength. The flavor opens with a kick of sweet pils malt, rather heavy with a bready sweetness. Some oyster cracker flavor, burdened with a slightly overweight apple fruitiness. The finish is moderately hopped, fairly spicy, with a german metallic/floral hop tinge. Fusel sweetness in the finish, actually adding some heat to the swallow. Despite the alcohol presence, the finish is actually quite dry, if not exactly refreshing. I'm sure I'd start swaying after a few of these. The sweetness is powerful (for the milder nature inherent with lager) with nothing to tame it's lingering saccharine bite. The hops are there, but the alcohol's definitely in charge. I'm all set with just this one.","UnionMade","0"
