2.37,11.8,1.75,2.25,2.5,2.25,2.5,"Boris Bold is the polar opposite of Boris Organic, which is clean, agreeable, and flavourful - it is it's evil brother. Alcoholics looking for a quick fix could do worse - and, to be sure, that seems to be the brewery's targeted demographic - but no average drinker should subject themselves. The vintners of Alsace, like the German brewers across the Vosges Mountains, have nothing to fear of Brasserie de Saverne; this is no threat to their reputations.","biegaman","Oct 11, 2012"

2.19,3.3,3.5,2,2,3,2,"Overall – Figured I'd give it a shot.. and basically got what I was expecting.. A harsh tasting beer that I'll never want to drink again.","spinrsx","Aug 20, 2010"

1.97,-7.1,1.5,2,2,2,2,"D- Not a bad drink if you want to get drunk quick. I would never recommend this for anybody aiming to try a tasty beer though. Tasty for a cheap high ABV though. It didn't offend me as much as some people, but at the same time it didn't impress me like others.","BBP","Nov 21, 2009"

1.65,-22.2,2,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Pours an orange body, with, contrary to what others have noted, a thin white head that sits around the edge of the glass. Immediately, alcohol attacks the nose, followed by an acidic citrus rind aroma. Some malt in the aroma as well, trailed by faint adjunct and chemicalish wafts. Taste is sweet. Some orange peel, alcohol is very much here. Lots of corn and sickly sweet malt. Finish is cloying, some hops in the aftertaste. Absolutely a malt liquor. I prefer the younger brother of boris bold.","mrmanning","Jun 16, 2008"
2.46,16,4,3,2,3,2,"Wow, the head looked like the top of a vanilla ice-cream cone! Round, bone-white, good retention. Nice! The color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a grainy sweetness that is characteristic for lagers. The mouthfeel was medium with a metallic overtone underlain with a corn-like sweetness. Finish continued with that same metal/corn combination. Oof.","woodychandler","Dec 18, 2007"
2.39,12.7,4.5,3,2,2,2,"I feel I can drink this one down, but wouldn't care for another. This is a gimmick beer marketed to younger folks, who want to get canned.","TheSarge","Jul 24, 2007"
2.3,8.5,3,3,2,2,2,"Biegaman gave me this one. Thanks? Very clear and gold, this one started with a dense, white cap, but quickly fell to a ring. It produced a bit of streaky lacing too. The aroma was sweet, with grainy malt and some fruity esters. Very low bitterness, mostly sweet with a strong alcohol presence and an acrid finish. Medium/light bodied with a syrupy texture and moderate carbonation. Alcohol was very hot. Not very good and not overly drinkable - I didn't finish my can. It's just an alcohol bomb with little malt or hop depth. I'd be surprised if it isn't made exclusively from extract. Certainly not a good example of a strong euro-lager.","DrJay","Mar 10, 2007"
2.13,0.5,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Drinkability- I guess if you dont like good beer it is alright. It will get you drunk.","MTNboy","Feb 07, 2007"
2.68,26.4,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear golden, big pillowy white head forms, goes pretty fast, no lace. Smell is weird corn, rice, adjuncty, some caramel, citrus, alcohol, touch of vanilla, pretty standard for the style. Taste is the same, although the alcohol is right at the front, bit of graininess, corn, caramel, bit smooth in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, warmth, but not too bad for the style. Thanks Jan!","Viggo","May 07, 2006"
3.43,61.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D- Drinks well, especially considering the alcohol. Loses marks for not offering anything extra to make it seem more interesting. Final analysis is that I like it but am not sure why.","JOaikido","Feb 12, 2006"
1.56,-26.4,3,2,1.5,1,1,"I'm not usually a fan of strong beers and this was no exception. The strong beers that I have liked have usually had a depth of taste that is in the forefront. In this case it is the strong alcohol content that is in the forefront.","Mit","Feb 03, 2006"
2.29,8,1.5,2.5,2.5,2,2,"I wouldn't recommend this beer for anything else but to get drunk, fast. When it comes to extremely strong beers (9-10%), I would prefer this better being how it is a bit tastier then most.","CrazyMike","Beers"
1.26,-40.6,2,1,1.5,1,1,"500ml can: Poured a semi-dark yellow color beer with large white foamy head with minimal retention. Carbonation seems quite low and the beer has a strong grainy aroma, which I didnt enjoy. Taste is also way too grainy for my taste and this beer resemble more of a malt liquor then a European strong lager. Alcohol is not well hidden which doesnt really matter since this beer ended up being poured in the drain.","Phyl21ca","0"
1.96,-7.5,3,2,1.5,2,2.5,"Drinkability: I guess I have a stronger constitution than the other reviewers, so I chugged it down and it stayed down. I would drink more if it were the only beer available, if I had some strong cheese or BBQ Doritos, and someone else was buying.","Conrad","Jun 09, 2005"
1.44,-32.1,3.5,2,1,1.5,1,"I've managed to choke down about a third of a glass of this stuff, and I've had enough of it for the rest of my life--sink pour time. It made quite an impression, and I shall avoid this Boris Bold so it cannot become a repeat offender, I've been violated enough.","IronDjinn","Beers"
