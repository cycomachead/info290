2.71,7.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. While it seemed way overdone, muddy, and forced, some of the notes enlivened the nostrils. The flavoring suffered from being overly boozy, and you really had a hard time getting past that to find much of anything at all. Had they been willing to subdue that a bit more, it could have potentially been a much more curious, complex drink.","TheBrewo","Beers"

Strong taste, expected from the high alcohol but other than that, nothing. Midly carbonated. it's okay if you have difficulties to go to sleep although you have already drunk a bunch of normal lagers.","Douberd","Nov 14, 2011"

3.08,21.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Sent to me in care package from the Netherlands. This is a beer that looks great ( the can that is) and is obviously for the comsumer to get drunk fast. Why else brew a 11.7% lager? That being said this beer is not as bad as other reviewers have said. It is slightly sweet but the alcohol is not that pronounced. I got hops off the nose and a decent midbody. I drank it out of the can at first but once I realized it wasn't terrible I poured it into a glass. Way too much ABV for the style but drinkable","canucklehead","Jun 12, 2010"

3,18.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Tried this one a day ago. 11.6% hmm? Just what you'd think - strong, little in the way of anything BUT alcohol, and still, pretty decent. The smell gives away it's strength, but the taste is not nearly as harsh as one might expect. And like someone else said, there was in fact some relatively good lacing on the glass. Ahem, well, good bang for your buck.","friendofthedevil","Jul 07, 2007"
2.68,5.9,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste is Aaaah... alcohol, burning alcohol, the kind that burns a hole in your stomach. The sweetness of the malt is covering up some of the alcohol, but not enough to give the beer whiskey-like booziness. Other than the alcohol and sweet malt tastes, there is not much else going on. After 1 bottle I feel a big cannon stampeding through my head and I feel that this is a one time experience. Not bad, but alcohol is not the reason to drink beer.","Absumaster","Feb 08, 2007"
2.12,-16.2,4,2,2,2,2,"I'd normally try and find at least one positive thing to say about a beer but with this one its difficult; it's simpy so unbalanced. The appearance is good - just look at it for a while then pour it down the sink.","BarryNL","Oct 30, 2006"

2.21,-12.6,3.5,2.5,2,2,2,"This ridiculously strong beer pours a very thin head, about 1/8". The head is persistent, though. Its color is a lovely golden yellow with lots of fine bubbles rising along the glass. The smell is a sweet, overpowering alcoholic experience. The alcohol is very strong in the mouth, lingering long after swallowing. It has a bitter, almost pilsner-like taste. Originally sold in half-liter bottles it was brought back by popular demand, but now in the cowardly 30cl euro bottles. If you're not aware of the strength of this beer and you drink it too fast and then try to stand up you immediately will sit down. Hence "Kanon", the Cannon...","Regenpak","Jun 06, 2005"
2.07,-18.2,2,2.5,2,2.5,1.5,"This beer was original one of six (I think) beers to celebrate the 100 year birthday of the swingtop. The other beers were must better. But probably due to the Dutch pilsner culture this was the beer that had a great impact. Three of these and you need only a glass of water the morning-after to be intoxicated again. It reminds me of Eku 28, not taste wise, but more image wise, look what we can brew. No Grolsch, leave the high ABV beers for the microbrewers, they can make tasty ones, and stop brewing this. Try Grolsch Amber again!","Redteketed","Beers"
1.53,-39.5,3,2.5,1,1.5,1,"BB aug 05. Not that great of a head annd golden to copper beercolor. Nose is malts bading in pure alcohol or at least that's the feeling you get. Taste is absolutly horrible, terrably sweet and very alcoholic. No bitterness noticeable and even malt is not detectable. What a horror brew this is. Unbelievable it's still has costumers cause I can't imagine anybody liking this accept for fuel to get as fast as possible drunk. Undrinkable IMO.","paterlodie","0"
