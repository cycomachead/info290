2.06,-14.5,3.5,2.5,1.75,1.5,2,"This beer was poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass and inebriated me at apx 55F.","are_doubleyou","Dec 24, 2014"
3.24,34.4,3,2.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Almost clear, amber color.  Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight grassy nose and flavor is a lot of caramel sweetness hiding the very high ABV. Strange, sweet bitter aftertaste.  $4.80 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.","jdhilt","Dec 22, 2014"

2.75,14.1,3,2.25,3,2.25,3,"So everyone of us who are rating this beer are doing so because we bought it because of the high ABV.  At 15% this is almost as high as it gets but that's where the positives pretty much end.  This beer has a putrid aroma.  It smells rotten, I had to check the dates to make sure it was still drinkable.  It poured a nice golden color, had way too much carbonation and a decent amount of lace.  It is too sweet to enjoy and very acidic and pungent.  Has a very strong and bitter taste similar to sulfur.  While it is still better than a Bud Light, I would only recommend getting this for the novelty factory.","ronniebruner","Dec 15, 2014"

1,-58.5,,,,,,"O: 1/5 -- $3 at 15% piqued my interest. Hadn't heard of brewery, and the label seemed promising. I was swindled. It's possibly one of the worst beverages I've ever had. I struggled through half of a 16.9oz bottle before finally dumping it, which I always try to avoid. I wonder if this is brewed as some kind of cruel joke. If I could go back and un-purchase it, I would. It's definitely crazy, so I guess mission accomplished.","Jon_G","Sep 10, 2014"
