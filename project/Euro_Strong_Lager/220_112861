4.14,13.4,3.75,4,4.25,4.5,4,"Poring this out I was surprised to see a clear ruby brown beer with some lacing and a white small head that was produced from what looks like a high level of carbonation.  The nose is dominated by malts, bready, nutty, some sweetness, little bit of yeast esters and some earthy tones.  Aroma is not overly complex or strong but still is nice and pleasant.  The taste follows the nose with malt forward dominate flavor but it contains more complexity with dark fruits.  raisins, breadiness, and esters.   Mouth is full bodied, effervescent, pillowy soft, and very appealing.   This is a great Euro Strong Lager and probably the first I have had in this style.  Give it a try if you like your strong beer more on the malty side that kinda has a quad similarity, cheers!","DrinkMoreBigBeers","Mar 15, 2015"

3.43,-6,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Nice brown tone with white head that dissipated in a few minutes.  Malt forward with a little alcohol heat, but not in a bad way.  Overall a clean beer, but nothing really complex that would make me look for it.","jb80016","Mar 02, 2015"

3.88,6.3,4,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"I like drier beers and am frequently disappointed by many beers of this type because of the overly sweet notes that coat the mouth and linger without any balance. However, for what it is, this beer is pretty good. It's not my first choice on the shelf, but I could drink it again.","jlipin8622","Feb 14, 2015"
3.66,0.3,3.75,4,3.25,3.75,4,"Attractive dark red amber with a modest foam. So sweet with caramel, but then the bitter aftertaste emerges. This is one of the classic alcoholic malt depth charges that Lagunitas used to be known for. And it goes down nicely, like a wet dream of a malt liquor. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego.","mactrail","Feb 12, 2015"

If you like lighter beers this ones probably for you. Taste is not too overpowering with a hint of fruitiness.","Totalpackage411","0"

2.39,-34.5,2.5,2.75,2.25,2.25,2.25,"Poured into tulip. Pours dark copper with a reddish hue. Thin off white head reduces to an extremely thin lacing quickly. Aroma is solventy/ heavy alcohol with hints of dark fruits. Flavor is heavy on the alcohol to the point that you would think it's higher than 9.6%. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Under the booze theres lots of sweetness with a slight plum, fig and molasses aftertaste. Described as a euro strong ale but tastes a whole lot like a barleywine that's not ready yet. If you have this or buy this in 2014 do yourself a favor and throw it in the cellar for a year or two.","beerjunky413","May 25, 2014"
