3.84,9.1,4,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Pours a clear, copper color.  2/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and good lacing.  Smells of caramel malt, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of yeast, slight hops, hint of tea, and a hint of sugar.  Fits the style of an Extra Special / Strong Bitter.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of earthy malt, caramel malt, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, slight subtle hops, and a hint of yeast.","Tone","Dec 28, 2014"

3.75,6.5,,,,,,"This was an interesting beer. I don't think this tastes like other ESBs that I've tried. It pours nicely into a SA Perfect Pint and displays some head and lacing but when I tried it with a Nonic there was virtually no head and no lacing, The color is amber with a hint of orange. The taste and aroma are hard to describe but I would lean toward earthy. I will say that I enjoyed the beer. It seems to be a nice transition to the fall for me although I would prefer a slightly darker color.","JimKal","Oct 24, 2014"
