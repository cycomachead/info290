3.97,-4.3,4.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Verdict: A very nice ESB from Three Floyds, pleasantly bitter and big. Lots of malt, plenty of underlying hops, a nice balance is struck. I appreciate that the traditional malty ESB backbone is still in the forefront when it comes to a Three Floyds beer, perhaps one of their least "not normal" beers, but it makes this a success.","kevanb","Saturday at 05:38 PM"

I have a soft spot for the English esb style and this just blows it wide open. So tasty and thick. I was excited to see bottles heading my way, so I hope to get more in the future. If I could pick a beer to drink every day with any meal it would be this one. A complex yet balanced masterpiece from Three Floyds.","BradtheGreat7","Apr 01, 2015"

Starts off with a refreshing wet taste that is bready and malty. It moves into a crisp bitter finish that is dry and complex. Like other 3 Floyds beers that I have had, this one is blended nicely together that is makes it hard to pick out individual attributes as they compliment each other very well. Only complaint is this was a little more watery then I was expecting, but the dry finish makes up for it.","Lemke10","Mar 17, 2012"

4.39,5.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Lord Admiral Nelson pours a roasted chestnut color, a bit dark for the style, and lightens to amber when heldo to light. The off white foam that caps the beer approaches three fingers in height, has displays decent retention, and is nice and sticky. The nose has some crisp biscuity and caramel malty notes, as well as some herbal hop notes. A light citric aroma enters the picture as well, and serves as a nice accent rather than taking over the whole beer. The nose serves as a pretty good preview of what's to come. The bready and caramel sweetness lead things off, before a modest bitterness lets itself be known mid palate. The balance is superb, I couldn't describe this beer as either overtly hoppy or malty. The same predominantly noble, herbal hop, with a light touch of American citrus blend is on display at the back end of each sip. Props the 3 Floyds for showing restraint and keeping this one essentially British, with just enough American influence to liven things up. The mouthfeel is pretty solid overall. The body is sturdy, relatively full for the ABV, and the carbonation is slightly understated. A great spin on a classic style.","axeman9182","Aug 05, 2011"
4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O - If one of the criteria for this style is balance, this is right on.

The beer is a cloudy amber color with a big frothy looking white head that shrinks down to soapy lacing. I'm not really loving the smell on this. Sweet malts are really front runners on this. I get a kind of apple sauce smell, but it seems really out of place. Behind all that is a slight smell of piney hops. I'd really love a bit more of a hoppy smell. Big malts on this with a decent bittering finish of floral piney hops. It's pretty nice drinking, but I overall am a little underwhelmed by this one right now. The mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I would imagine but the carbonation is nice. Overall this beer drinks fair enough, but I'm not in love with it.","Bendurgin","Sep 20, 2010"

The smell is a wonderful mix of floral hops, bitterness, and light dry sweetness. The taste is good but it's not mind blowing by any means. I remember this being better last year. It drinks very thin and isn't as crisp as I'd like it to be. It's very drinkable because it's a very solid beer but this bottle at least disappointed me a little bit.

4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A medium amber color is poured in the glass, with a light beige colored head that is about a half inch high. The laces slowly down the glass and settles to a thin layer. Citrus and grass right into the nose at every scent, then gradually fading away slowly. A cracked grain and bready/yeasty flavor attacks the palate come to the front, but is soon overtaken by the hops. The hops bring a strong grapefruit flavor that attacks the palate, that is followed up by a piney resin flavor, that lingers on the palate. A watery thin texture at the front, then gradually gaining weight and becoming more medium bodied, staying that way till the finish. A strong bitter? How about an extreme bitter, this one crosses over into the IPA realm. Everything is very good about this beer though, an inviting look and a fragrant aroma invites one to the glass. The taste just backs up those aspects, with strong hop flavor and intensity. The feel stays consistent all the way through, so hop heads drink up.","cameraman","May 17, 2010"

Overall this was unlike any other ESB I've had, but it was certainly both extra special and bitter. It was also very sweet and hoppy and clean.

Just beyond it's a cool sweep of breadishly sweet malts keeping things moving on an even keel. The taste sharpens, becoming distinctly Cu metallic. A soft floral note takes hold right as the beer peaks. The sharp copper and the softly bitter hop dance wonderfully towards my throat. A charge of citric sweet lemon spreads quickly, becoming earthy and bitter. Buttery and then more pointedly bitter in the finish. puckering now, with some high notes sticking around the top of my mouth. A fun beer to swirl around. Those full buttery notes take their toll nearing the end of the bomber. My lips are sticky, along with my throat. No denying though that this beer is fun as it looks.","Philabeerphia","Mar 11, 2010"

Lots of tropical fruit flavors up front, some malt and then...I dunno...it just sort of evaporates!

Pours a copper reddish orange with a decent 2 finger head.

Taste here is great, big piney hops, a bit of weedy hops, finished with some biscuity/bready malt--a hopped-up ESB. Great stuff here, I guess this review is to style, because as a beer overall I would call this an A-, but as an ESB, this is definitely an A. MF is medium, coating, creamy, maybe a tad over-carbonated. Very drinkable, a great session brew, if I had it in me I could easily have three bombers of this.
