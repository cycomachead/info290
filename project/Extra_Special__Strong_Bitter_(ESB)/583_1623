1.42,-62.3,3,1,1,3,1.5,"I was surprised by this beer considering the great balance and flavor of Schlafly's Kolsch style ale (one of the best American Kolsch-styles I've tasted).  I've come to expect at least a touch of diacetyl in an ESB (and a bit more than a touch is acceptable in the style), but there is none here.  What IS in this brew is a huge mouthful of hops - way more hops than belong in any low gravity english style ale.    This is not an ESB; it's an an american "IPA" posturing with a fake accent.  If you tried to drink this beer at cellar temps, the hops would saturate your palate so you couldn't taste any malt at all.  That's not to say others won't like it.  If your idea of craft beer is yet another IPA, you'll probably like this, too.  Considering the shelves in my area are overflowing with IPA's, my opinion of this beer is almost definitely in the minority.","onansalad","Jan 22, 2015"
