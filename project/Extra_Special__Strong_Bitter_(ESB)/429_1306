Aroma of caramel and light biscuit malt, light earthy nuttiness. Flavor is biscuit malt, tea, faint citrus with a light grassy hop finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A nice light bitter with traditional tasting malt and a bit more hops than traditional, but without breaking character. A worthy domestic take on this style.","LiquidAmber","Jun 23, 2014"

Scents of caramel, fruity esters, apple, tea and some floral hops. A nice, appealing, pub ale aroma, nothing too complex, but balanced and inviting. Taste begins with some nice caramel malt before moving into floral hop bitterness that is sustained throughout. There is also a distinct herbal hop flavor and some pine resin. A bit of grainy malt on the finish and aftertaste, along with bitter hops. The overall flavor is rather bitter for an ESB, but it's not bad, a little more sweet malt would make it better though. Mouthfeel is light bodied, lightly carbonation and semi-drying, with a bit of a soapy feel. A good session ale mouthfeel that makes you want to another sip. Overall this is a good ESB, with a nice aroma and mouthfeel and a good, albeit bitter flavor. If it was a little less bitter it would be better, but it's not bad.","Auraan","Mar 21, 2014"

2.72,-29.2,3,3.5,2.5,3,2,"Dark amber or light brown in color. It has an autumn orange type of hue similar to some wood furniture you see. Some prickle and little to no head. Malty nose with a faint hint of hops. The attack is clean, but then the flavor hammers you with a strong bitter nut flavor. The nut and the bitter would be fine in the correct proportions and balance, but it seems that the nut overpowers the bitter and I don't feel that its a good thing. The aftertaste is consistent with the flavor. It sort of reminds me of when you get the nuts in the mixed nuts around Thanksgiving that are dried, or gone bad and they give a huge tart flavor that dries the mouth. I am appreciative that my father hauled this beer to me from Alaska, but its not my favorite of those he brought me.","Ragingbull","Jun 19, 2009"

Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a bitterness softly tempered by a caramel/malt sweetness. Finish had the same commingling of bitter and sweet that I got on the tongue. In fact, as it warmed, I got a really pronounced biscuitiness on the extreme finish.

4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The first beer that I had after getting off the plane in Las Vegas. This turned out to be a pure, simple, and very desirable beer. It pours a brilliant, sparkling copper / amber hue with a steady off-white head formation that laced well as the beer line fell. Moderate aromas of caramel malts, and ale-typical fruity esters. Mild fermented flavors swirl around the malts for a rich aroma, flavor, and feel. An herbal, pungent English hop character cleans the beer up a bit, while offering some complexity. The beer is very well balanced, not preferencing the hops nor the malts. The feel is also moderate, not too heavy or thick, but not watering either. Very easy to drink with a mild hop lingering and flavor. I certainly would not hesitate to buy this beer again.","BEERchitect","Dec 07, 2007"

3.8,-1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"The Taste is quite good, with food that Theres a kind of sweet, almost honey like flavor from the malt, that flavor is quickly over ran by the hops, which fill the mouth smoothly. The star here is the delectable smoothness, which is kept interesting by spikes of hops and carbonation. It feels grat on the mouth.","Charthepirate","Nov 05, 2005"
4.42,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a light amber color, nice white head and lacing down the glass. Smell is slightly malty with nice hop scent.Taste is sweet/fruity at first with a nice bitter hop aftertaste. This beer goes down very easily. Picked up a six pack of this for $3.99 at Osco Drug in Billings, MT. Not sure why it is so cheap, but I'm going to have to go back and stock up.","loren01","Oct 23, 2005"
3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Alaskan's ESB is a well-crafted and finely balanced dark amber ale with a malty, caramelish nose and similar flavor (the malt is a bit more bready than the aroma suggests) that's peppered with piney/leafy/grassy hops and backed by a brisk bitterness. The appearance is quite nice with a clear copper body that reveals gleaming orange and gold highlights beneath a creamy head of antiqued ivory. It's crisp in the mouth with a medium body; and it's balance leaves it nicely drinkable. Well done!","NeroFiddled","Jul 27, 2005"

4.15,8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Light haze in a rich amber copper body, topped by a pillowy, light sandy head. Great lacing. Nose is minerally, caramel bread malts with light butteriness, and a fragrant, resiny hop bitterness. Minerally-sweet bread malt flavor up front, light fruitiness follows, but big hop bite takes over. Hops are minty, piney, resinous, and bitter. Finish is earthy, bitter, dry, with lingering caramel fruit. Medium-bodied, with a minerally, dry feel. One of the best American ESB's I've ever had.","alexgash","Apr 21, 2005"
4.05,5.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Been sitting on this beer for a little bit. Its time to drink it. This beer pours a copper color with a small ring around the top. The nose is slightly citrusy, slightly dirty in the hop with a moderate caramel malty backbone. The flavor is pretty spot on with that nose, though the dirty hop may be a bit more forceful in the flavor. Everything is pretty mellow, not taste taking center stage. The feel is just shy of moderate to moderate, smooth, with a small carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. I would really find it refreshing on a warm summer day.","kmpitz2","Jan 28, 2005"

4.22,9.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a nice amber color with a thin white head that stays around long enough to enjoy the glass. Smell is of hops and yeasty esters. Taste is of hops than a subtle graineness. Aftertaste is all hops and lasts and lasts. A great brew thats interesting enough to keep you drinking. Cheers.","zacharius","Sep 26, 2004"
4.39,14.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I consider most ESB's to be food beers. By that I mean that they usually are really good compliments of spicy food but are not the greatest by themselves. This beer provides the example. I had two of these, one by itself and one with some spicy Mexican food. The flavor in this beer matched really well with the spicyness of the Mexican food. There was a spicy hop dominance in the beer which was annoying alone but good with food. The malts play a perfect role in providing flavor and holding bitterness back but yet letting the hops do their thing. The bitterness is on the light side but that only means more hop spicyness. There seems to be a bit on a acidic quality in there as well. The hops linger in here. Lots of earthy flavors underneath. This is a really well made ESB.","granger10","Sep 16, 2004"

4.38,14.1,3,5,4,4,5,"A first class session brew with a dry finish and great quenching qualities. Many thanks to my buddy Pierre Archambault who lugged a 6er of this and the amber back from his expedition on the summit of Mt. McKinley.","Beersignal","Jul 11, 2004"
4.33,12.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a deep amber, one of the darkest bitter I have evere encountered head was thin but lasted nicely, good lacing was present. Nice malty and subtle hop aroma was apparent, somewhat grainy. Very smooth, nice hop pesence with solid backbone of caramel malts. Alaskan Brewing Co. was always kind of passed over by yours truly, big mistake. These beers have become a real joy to drink. Their trademark is outstanding smoothness and drinkability, and this might be the best domestic ESB out there. Get this fine ber if you ever see it.","Mark","Jun 26, 2004"
3.5,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From a 12 ounce bottle, it pours a deep gold with a an off white head that leaves just a bit of lace. Hops dominate the smell. Malt sweetness is just noticeable under a hop bitterness that is especially pronounced at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are more or less par for the course for an ESB. Overall, it's a decent brew but nothing distinguishes it.","mickeymac","May 24, 2004"
4.04,5.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the beer was extremely drinkable. This would be the perfect session beer as the taste is more than interesting enough to hold your attention.","Redrover","May 12, 2004"
3.78,-1.6,2,4,4,3,4,"Alaskan ESB pours a dark amber with streaks of light with really no head to speak of. The smell is a perfect blend of malts and hops and fruit tones. Taste is of fruit and caramel with a perfect balance of both malts and hops. Feels very smooth in the mouth but still doesn't have that pizazz. A very drinkable beer however, Alaskan Brewing has always impressed me.","beertaster13","Mar 15, 2004"

3.6,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A darkish amber, good head retention and some sudsy lingering lace. Aroma of dark malts. This is a dark beer for a bitter, more aggressively roasty than the traditional examples. Hops are grassy and peppery and creep up on the finish leaving a sparkle in the mouth. Malts are biscuity and sweet and typical of Alaskan brews. Some wood/varnish flavors that are the low points of an otherwise very tasty brew. Mouthfeel is pretty good but maybe a little soapy. Pleasant lemony aftertaste. This isn't initally as easy drinking as some of the best bitters, but the aftertaste is very coaxing. It's a bit raw and unrefined but could be very suitable for warming the bones on a damp muddy spring day.","Thrasher","Dec 17, 2003"

3.42,-10.9,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"This is really one of the only brews by Alaskan that I didn't enjoy all that much. Color is a lighter amber, thin off-white head faded leaving minimal light spots of lace. Very acidic flavor and bite, bitterness should be sweet and nice, this had a taste of generic aspirin in the finish that I just didn't like. I highly doubt it was a bad batch cuz all the others I had by Alaskan were great. Had a good smell of floral sweetness and light malt but that didn't carry over in the taste department for me. I've diffenately had better ESB. But ESB's are not my forte'.","tavernjef","Mar 17, 2003"
3.92,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The color on the pour is a limpid burnished copper, the head modest, frothy and the color a light beige with the lace a fine covering sheet. Nose is floral, buttery, crisp and clean, a real sniffer with the start sweet and full of malt, top is middling in feel. Finish has a delectable hop presence, acidity moderate and the aftertaste quite dry, and a real credit to the style.","Gusler","Mar 03, 2003"

4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is a nice shade of scarlet red. A small creamy beige head recedes to a thin coating in seconds. Lacing is adequate. The aroma is about half and half between piney hop notes and caramel/biscuity malt tones. This beer displays some nice balance for the style and types of hops utilized (Centennial and Cascade). Hops impart some bitterness, piney tones and some rind qualities to a lesser degree. Malt provides a beautiful underlying and balance in this beer. Although bread like and doughy at times, the malt profile is primarily caramel. And very nice. Beautiful smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is low. Drinkability is high. It's been months since I tried a beverage from Alaskan and they have picked up right where they left off (in my mind). Very good stuff.","Bighuge","Nov 19, 2002"
