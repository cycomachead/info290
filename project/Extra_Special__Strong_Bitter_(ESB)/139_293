This one was lacking on the nose and a little on the mouthfeel.  The taste worked ok - but still wasn't out of the park.","fscottkey","Jan 03, 2015"

4,11.4,,,,,,"Beautiful color.  The smell of a bitter with sweet malty undertones.  Interesting choice of hops, not quite floral enough.  Malt balance is perfect.  Not a clean hoppy finish but a tad too bitter.  Head and lacing perfect.  Overall a beer its own.  Very good.","bierluvre","Nov 02, 2014"
