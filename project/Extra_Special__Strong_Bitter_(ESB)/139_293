Light bodied and well carbonated. The flavor profile is well balanced and complex. It begins with a nice biscuit that flows into the toffee and caramel notes. With a touch of sweetness, it transitions into the bitterness, which is an excellent example of an ESB.

No dating info on the bottle to suggest its age. Consumed while at a hotel where drinking vessels were at a minimum and a lack of ice required the beer to be drunk rather warm, so another tasting would seem in order for a totally fair review.","scotorum","Jan 29, 2014"

3.38,-5.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Fuck that New Thumper noise! Anyway, this stuff pours a clear bronze topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises earthy greens, light banana, toffee, and a touch of buttery biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a kiss of Connecticut tobacco and light grapefruit peel. The buttery character is toned down a decent bit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice ESB, nothing close to special, but something fairly drinkable and generally enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Nov 25, 2012"

The beer is quite hazy like a dark apple juice and there are quite a few bubbles racing to the top with carbonation. The beer smells rather skunky with nice hints of caramel and burnt malts and burnt sugars. As the beer settles the skunkiness mellows out and brings forward the malts nicely. The beer tastes heavy with the roasted malts and nice caramel hints in the taste. There is a slight bitter tinge in the back of the taste and aftertaste reminiscent of light citrus, but it is very faint. The mouthfeel is smooth and caramelly on the tongue with a little rush of carbonation that quickly smoothes out into a more velvety feel. Overall this is nice roasted example of an ESB, the bitters are not very present here even for the styles slight bitters, but the malts are excellent on the tongue.","Maxwell","Aug 11, 2012"

3.19,-11.1,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a very slightly hazed amber color, with a beginning foamy, light head that quickly retreats to a thin film. Aromas are hoppy, sour malt, a little tart, and a slight soap residue smell (don't think that was supposed to be there). The beer is a somewhat malty-caramel flavor of foundation, but sour instead of sweet, which is odd and unique. Slightly hopped flavors in the background, as well as some fruity characteristics. The body is round and smooth, but also carbonated enough to have a crisp edge to the finish. The aftertaste is slightly sour, and has a minimal linger. This has some unique flavors and body characteristics that make it a sipper, and not necessarily one that needs a follow-up. I would take this as a one and done beer, and move on to a different brew.","GarthDanielson","Feb 18, 2011"

Big malt with a light beginning bitterness that builds through the taste. The finish is still quite balanced, however, and not quite as bitter as I expected for an ESB.

So, I have a touch nostalgia for this one. At any rate, this beer has a big caramel flavor and a fairly unique yeastiness, that I now understand is Shipyard's signature. The beer looks very nice with a highlighted amber liquid and a fairly sticky head. The aroma is caramel malt and a touch of interesting fruity esters. The flavor is quite good and big for the abv with a lot of malt and a clean, dry hop finish. It's an excellent session beer that doesn't skimp on the flavor. I imagine it's wonderful out of a cask. I would love to have that experience. The feel is nicely chewy but not astonishing. I bet fresh from a cask would up this category. The Shipyard yeast is interesting, and, while I like it, I'm not sure that the beer around it is incredible. The caramel malt is good, but it's not great. It could just use more richness. I don't have a lot of experience with ESBs, so my rating could change as my experience deepens.

An orange/citrus hops background that comes through a well carbonated brew for a very refreshing and drinkable pint. Sort of a summer styled beer with a spicey/pumpkin flavor, a bit peppery at the finish. It did seem to lose its distinctiveness at the end a little but overall this was a very nice choice.

Not much going on here. Some hints of malt and bread but very slight. The taste is a very nice mixture of fruit and biscuit, with a nice hops presence that only adds to the over all flavor instead of trying to dominate. Nice creamy feel in the mouth.

Taste gets back on track though, and has some chocolate and toffee alongside an interesting fruitiness and a touch of hops and butter. Finishes dry and bitter.

I get a buttery and lighter toasty malt overtone, with a touch of grain sharpness. Very light earthy British hops play in the background, but not as much as I would like. Not really grabbing my attention here. Flavor is a bit soapy. There is a butteryness, light graineyness and toastyness, and moderate hop bitterness that are not melding well together. Bitterness hangs on nicely on the finish. Aftertaste is a touch bready/toasty as well. Aftertaste is better than the beer itself, burps are the same way.

Malty nose, toasted malt, nuts, and rose-like alcohol. Tart sherry flavor is stronger than the toasty malt and makes any hops present difficult to detect. Aftertaste is dry and corky like cheap blush. Slow and tiny flow of carbonation, and a medium body. The freshness date is unclear, or it may have been oxidized, but if this is the way the brewer's intended it to taste, then its a bad attempt at the style. The vinous bite throws the flavor out of balance and harshens the mouthfeel, then becomes astringent in the finish.

The mild acidity helps launch a drying trail of bitterness that keeps it tidy. Spent tea leaves weasel in later. This beer is a charmer.

The aroma was of a nondescript fruity and nutty nature with a spicy and floral hop presence. The taste was well balanced between the sweet and fruity malt with the flavor of caramel coated red delicious apples, and a bitter hoppyness with a pomegranate like astringency. The mouthfeel was buttery (with salt) and bone dry, typical of many English bitters. Very easy to drink and sessionable, despite the nearly 6% ABV.

There is a favorable slick character to the mouthfeel. Not quite creamy, but flirting with that idea. I could drink more of these without having any qualms about it.

Getting alot of diacetyl -buttery and nutty. Deep scotch whiskey flavor more as it warms. Bit of peppery bite in the back of the tongue that just hangs on. The bitterness is not extreme, and I do like bitters. I cannot place what exactly is turning me off on this one, I cannot place what it is that I do not agree with, and just cannot enjoy this fully for some reason. Definately better as it warms and the buttery flavors come out.

The aroma is very subdued, I can't pick out any individual smells, just beer. The taste begins with a nice bit of hop bitterness. Unfortunately, this quickly fades to the dreaded diacetyl butteryness. The first few sips aren't bad, but it builds up and becomes oppressive. The aftertase is overrun by this.

Smell is very yeasty, fruity, and loaded with some nose-hair-burning something-or-other. Taste as expected is very yeasty and tastes almost like a strong sparkling cider or something. I'm definately tasting apple juice. Don't know if I've really tasted anything like this in a beer before but for some reason it kind of remids me of Ancor Steam. Slight alchohol is present but except for that it's not really all that bitter for an ESB. Pretty smooth in the mouth but maybe a bit too carbonated.

The aroma is of sweet malt or biscuit. The taste is mostly that sweet carameled malt, though crisp, presents a creamy, buttery feel. Earth notes of husky grain balanced well by a spicey hop. Alcohol is faint at 5.9% but does a nice job of warming the result. A dry grain finish on the mouth rounds things out.

A good balanced malt and spicey hop finish. Again there is something in the aroma and the flavor that I can't put my finger on. I belive it has something to do with the Ringwood yeast.

The taste is almost as robust with hops and malts giving the backdrop for a sharp (and again) buttery taste with the same cheesy and thick sharp spicy tastes. What a great taste for a beer, especially since the last time I had this I happened upon a bad batch which tasted more like lighter fluid than anything good.

4.35,21.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of my favorite all-time beers. It pours a tarnished copper in color, like the color of antique, stained furniture. Like that furniture, the smell makes me think of old and history. It pours clean with little head and the lace consistently clings to the side of the glass. The flaovr is slightly buttery with hints of apples; almost apple cider but no where near the taste of hard cider. It's best served at room temperature and at first feels odd on the tongue because it is gnerally flat, but that is the appeal of the beer.","MuddyFeet","Mar 15, 2004"

More sweet malt on the palate, followed by some slight tartness. Not unlike Rogue Dead Guy, actually. I have to say, I think this is a bit misclassified as an old ale by BA, esp. since it calls itself an ESA. Regardless, I'm a fan. A great session beer, I'm glad I found it.","ElGordo","Feb 07, 2004"

Anyway, it had a strong, sweet smell with notes of soft malt and maybe caramel. The taste had the same maltiness and sweetness, with a heavy aftertaste. This beer started a touch heavy, but got lighter as I drank, and the expected warmness was also present. Thumper is average, but better than I remember from the last time I had it.

Regardless of that, the beer poured a handsomely bright and clear copper color. The head was huge which simmered down into a small film and left a nice lacing behind. Theres a sweet malt aroma with some fruitiness, maybe green apples or sour cherries. The taste is sweet and fruity with a nice tang. This is a very nice ale, but for an Extra Special Ale, which this beer claims to be  The benchmark for me is Yards ESA. Although this ale is very drinkable.","pezoids","Sep 08, 2003"
4.05,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The taste of diacetyl too, with nice malt qualities and hop bitterness in the biginning and on the finish.

This dark, golden-amber ale from the good old Portland Shipyard may be their best brew; it is complex and tantalizing, from the ringwood yeast taste (very full) which balances off the citrusy hops to the toffee finish edged with just the right slice of bitterness, there's a lot to like about this ale. Thankfully, it's a local favorite for me; I'll be having more of this.","longpondbeerman","Aug 11, 2003"
4.35,21.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tried just before trying Fuller's ESB which I loved. I must say though that this was a damn good eample of the style. The beer poured a nice golden caramel and sported a thick pillowey head. Aromas of malt extract, hop and bisquit were at the forefront. A rich yet velvety ale that slides down the old gullet with ease. An extracted, malted milk sort of sweetness coats the tongue and mouth-I love the flavor of malt!! As the beer warms it takes on an even larger malt persona. A very drinkable number with some citric hoppiness way in the background evening things out. Nice!","moulefrite","Aug 08, 2003"
4.3,19.8,4,4,4,5,5,"Served cask conditioned at the Wharf Pub in Newport RI. I had this about six years ago here at this very same pub and was completely delighted to find them still serving it. This ale is quite a treat conditioned. Slightly hazy and deep amber in color with a creamy white head. Aroma is as complex as its flavor, a bit musky, grainy and earthy with a delicious maltiness and slightly bitter. Super smooth and creamy body that glides down your throat like butter. So smooth and delicious that I had finished 3 pints in less than a half hour. Hope they have it when I return again someday.","BierReise","Aug 03, 2003"
3.96,10.3,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Clear, dark bronze body with a tight, cream-colored head. Mild aroma, smells faintly of fruit. Not very strong; would have liked a stronger aroma. Sweet in the mouth at first, then dry, astringent and a tad bitter. Slightly chewy and round. Aftertaste is like burnt caramel, almost smoky. An interesting beer. I have not much experience with ESBs, and this beer suggests that I ought to.","Darkale","Jul 28, 2003"
4.1,14.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A clear, orange-ish/copper body displays dozens of streams of tiny bubbles rising steadily towards its creamy off-white head. The retention is great, and it maintains a short creamy cap throughout the entire pint; as well as leaving some nice lace. The nose displays the typical Ringwood yeast signature of gentle buttery diacetyl amidst a caramelish malt and some earthy hops. It's quite pleasant and welcomes you back to the pint with each ensuing sip. It's lightly crisp but also mildly creamy in the mouth due to it's fine and moderate carbonation and light/medium body. The flavor delivers a mildly buttery, nutty, and caramel/toffee-ish malt upfront; followed by a quick flash of fruit and then some more nuttiness. Earthy hops emerge (must be Fuggles!) towards the swallow as the bitterness rises. It finishes dry with some ligering earthy hop amidst a wide but low-key bitterness and some residual buttery biscuit-like malt. It's very well-balanced with a firm bitterness that keeps it from becoming cloying, yet allows the malt character to come through clearly.Well done! For those who find a touch of buttery diacetyl pleasing, this is a great session ale (with the exception of it's slightly high alcohol at 5.7%).","NeroFiddled","Jul 01, 2003"

The taste has a very warm feel even when the beer is cold. I would recommend trying this one.","clvand0","Jun 20, 2003"
3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Color is a amber with slight chill haze with slow bubbly carbonation inside, a thin off-white head that faded fast and minimal lacing in spots. Smell is sweet caramel malt, lightly earthed, nice fruity esters and a light hoppy backing. Taste is crispy with a caramel creamyness following with a small warmth of alcohol and fruity esters get involved leading into some toasty biscuit and breadish sweet grain, a touch of fruitiness from some loosely layered hop bitterness. Finish is a balancing act of lingering aftertastes of dry, lightly piney and very light fruity hoppyness. Quite interesting little finish. Feel is medium bodied with a play of slight roughness in the front with a bit of creamyness and chewyness into the light dry playful finish. Seems to smooth out as it warms. Drinkable ESB, but its not all that "Extra Special" but would make for a good session beer.","tavernjef","Jun 20, 2003"

4.3,19.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A fine interpretation by Shipyard of an English Best Bitter. Pours an amber color with a lasting head. The impact of the Ringwood yeast is not as dominant as in some of the Shipyard brews. The overall texture of the product is very smooth with some definite fruit overtones and a somewhat hoppy finish. No unpleasant aftertaste. This product seems to be getting a wider distribution these days and I now see it available in 12-packs as well as 6-packs. Well worth the premium price of a micro.","Greenlabel","May 31, 2003"
4,11.4,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Clear bronze hue. Thin, light cream white head leaves lace. Earthy hops along with a buttery toffee like caramel malt and diacetyl combination dominate the aroma. Mild figgy esters and notes of dilute molasses drizzled bready malt are secondary, while an agreeable hint of sweet, nutty marzipan emerges as the beer breathes. Brief snap of bread crust sweetness in flavor is quickly washed by buttery rich toffee and faintly roasty dark lovibind caramel malt. Becomes distinctly nut driven mid palate, with soft notes of almonds and peanuts lending a mildly sugary, brittle impression. Earthy, slightly dirty, Fuggles hop flavor. Fruit esters surface late and are comprised of ripe dates and sweet figs. Hop bitterness is mild, and allow malt character to dominate, but residual sweetness never becomes cloying. A touch lightly bodied, with an oily, but thinnish and passably dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes with a lingering suggestion of burnt bread and butter. Almost spot on for an ESB. Heavy on the diacetyl, yet well integrated in that respect. Malt driven and very tasty. Thanks Mainebeerman!","marc77","May 29, 2003"

When I was younger Old Thumper was not as apealing, but over the years I have grown to love it. It pours a very light copper color with little carbonation bubbles. The head is very yellowish and it recedes very quickly leaving some more white color lace on the side of the glass. The smell was very buttery with scent of hops and bitter. The taste had some unsweet caramel and the Ringwood was extremely prevelant. My mother always used to say that Old Thumper tasted like a rope from a ship and I feel that for this "extra special" bitter it is a huge compliment.

It turns out that the nose was a good indicator of what was about to happen on the palete. Woody. Cedar-like dryness. Fruity to an extent (apples?). And nice and bitter. It's not an IBU monster, but the bitterness is apparant and nice. And the buttery/butterscotch characteristic is present as well in small doses.

3.83,6.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Dark amber with off white head.   Full aroma with more malt character than hops.  Taste is rich and floral with a flower-like taste with smooth malt following.  Rich mouthfeel, somewhat creamy.  Taste.  Finishes nicely.","psugrad98","Jul 01, 2002"
2.91,-18.9,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Deep amber color with a pale creamy white head.  Slight sweet malt nose but lacks hops.  Upon first taste there is much malt sweetness followed by slight bitterness, but not even close enough  to balence the "bitter" brew.  Quite smooth and a good look to the lace.  This brew lacks true crisp bitterness.  There is a good smooth malt base but nothing wows the tongue.  I had this in the Orlando Airport Brew Pub.","frank4sail","Jun 14, 2002"
3.85,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Golden orange, off-white head that didn't hold but was full. Hay and citrus on the nose. The hops stand out nicely, sharp finish. Slight bitterness sticks to the roof of your mouth.","packetknife","May 31, 2002"

3.68,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It makes this beer unique as well. It's a nice attempt at a different beer considering all of the similar schwag that gets thrown at us. With that said though, it's hard for me to ignore the faintly soapy character of this beer.","hbis2gut","Mar 05, 2002"
3.6,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"One of my first out of the ordinary beers. Solid English style special bitter. Good malty backbone. Some semi-buttery notes are present. Hops are reserved, but adequate enough to balance. Good quaffability. Thumper originates from the Ringwood Brewery in England and is now Shipyard's flagship brew.","John","Sep 24, 2001"
