3.13,-14.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.25,"Bottle. Pours a coppery color. I had no idea what style this beer was. It smells so generic it hurts. Caramel malt, some estery aromas. Yep. The first sip did not do this beer any favors in my eyes. Boring. Fruity, caramelly, estery. There's something just a little odd about the flavor that I can't put my finger on either. Medium bodied. Not much bitterness. This one is hard to remember.","VelvetExtract","Jan 30, 2015"
