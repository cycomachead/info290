Either Southern Tier has changed the recipe for this beer and amped up the malt presence while dialing down the hops, which I doubt, or my palate has really grown over the past year to be much more tolerant of hops, as I found this yearâ€™s edition to be really, really tasty!","Jeffreysan","Jan 02, 2015"

There is nothing special about this beer. It tastes just like a standard IPA, even though I don't think it's classified as such. I was disappointed by this beer.","mchegash","Dec 13, 2014"
