It didn't have as much of a caramel overtone as many other ESB's that I've had, but it has a nice biscuit quality which is pleasant enough to make it an enjoyable drinking experience.

I am used to fairly tasteless pilsners, that are being tapped from a frosty tap, so this was completely different. Pumped into a pint glass, flat dark color with little head. The room temperature opened up the beer to have a solid hop presence and a full malty taste. I think I would enjoy it more now that I have sampled more cask ales and a wider variety of beers, but I'm glad my first was this one!","Kris450","May 01, 2014"

I can't even recommend this to a hop-head, because the hops-- while being the most pronounced of the flavors-- just come across as weak and half-hearted. Don't think I'll be returning to this one.

Flavor is mild, malt, mild hops, a bit of a chemical aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very bubbly but thin.

This beer is malt forward but with a lot of fruity character as well. Caramel and sweet bitter nuts (like pecans) along with earthy hops and raisins, bramble fruit (raspberries). The brown sugar combines with sour fruit and bitter nuts to yield a pleasant complexity (albeit less complex than Fuller's ESB), yet the body renders the beer quite drinkable. Solid bitter or mild ale with a tea leaf dry finish and nice hoppiness compared to macrobrewed examples of the style. I also get a sanguine tang in the finish. Wouldn't do much different other than maybe temper the bitter finish a little.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 24, 2013"

Really smells like a quad. Flavor follows the dark fruit with some cherry and slight bitter. Medium bodied, a bit slick, with low medium carbonation.

3.89,3.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.25,4.25,"Overall, I would say that this is a good beer! I didn't get a huge amount of diacetyl like like everyone was saying. The beer was NOT syrupy sweet out of the bottle. I served it at 55 degrees F, maybe that is the way to go. The only problem with the beer that I had was that it was a little thin or watery, but that leads to more drinking! At 5.2 ABV you could drink a few of these! I'm going to give it high 3's or a 4 out of 5!","WissBrauSean","Apr 01, 2013"

Taste begins with a toffee start, followed by some rich bready flavors, then a earthy hop hint. The finish is long and minerally, in a good way. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall an excellent ale that I plan to get again.","tronester","Mar 27, 2013"

The nose comprises light buttery biscuit, perfume-y flowers, light greens, and a kiss of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of hard water, some grass, and a touch of toast. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a nice bitter, nothing that will shake your perception of the style or the beverage, but something easy to drink and easy to enjoy.","TMoney2591","Feb 26, 2013"

3.8,1.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a ruby red orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, spice, nutmeg, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, bread, earth, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Despite the fact that this is not a complex beer by any means, it makes up for this fact with a really good balance of flavors and aromas throughout. This made this brew quite approachable and rather enjoyable. I had this brew a long time ago before I even knew what BA was and absolutely loved it. Now that I have experienced so many new beers and my palate has completely changed, it is still solid, but just does not have the same magic that it had for me 5+ years ago. Definitely a good intro beer into craft beer for the truly curious or for the veteran alike. You can’t go wrong either way.","thagr81us","Jan 25, 2013"

3.71,-1.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep amber reddish color. Very small and quickly disappearing tan head. The aroma is very subtle, malty sweet and caramel smelling with a hint of English hops. Taste follows suit, I really did not get much of a bitter flavor at all out of it which was slightly disappointing. Taste is sweet, with caramel and biscuit flavors, very clean with a slight bitter bite at the end. Full bodied with a rather thick mouthfeel. Low carbonation, possibly as a result of the growler as I remember it being higher when I sampled it from the store. Overall, this is a good dark English ale, however I would say it lacks the bitterness to be considered an ESB. Pleased nonetheless with this beer and will probably have again.","scvance","Sep 17, 2012"

Roasted malt and notes of Belgian yeast comprise the aroma. The mouthfeel is full, wet, and soft. There's a bit of tart fruit competing with the flat, sweet flavor of ripe date.

The smell is fairly sublime with notes of bread, caramel, and pine. Mouthfeel is about average, not thin, but not syrupy thick either. I can detect some rye notes in flavor along with sweet malt well balanced by the bitter hops on the finish. But I honestly didn't think it was all that bitter considering this is supposed to be a strong bitter. Overall a splendid offering.","Mojo","Aug 19, 2012"

The smell is medium strength but quite complex with malt, chocolate, bitter hops, and elements I find hard to describe. The taste mirrors the smell and throws in caramel. It hits the palette as sweet but then vanishes to be replaced by the strong bitters in the finish. Really quite a nice beer.","MoreThanWine","Feb 11, 2012"

Sweet nose of caramel, syrup, light floral hops. The mouth is a little more bubbly than I'd like. I thought this would be a bit more smooth and mellow. Sweet toffee notes with some light caramel and a smidge of alcohol on the finish. Not a bad beer by any means. I'd have this again. It was refreshing and a great way to close out my lunch.","Onenote81","Nov 04, 2011"

4.63,23.5,4.5,4,5,4,5,"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours leaving a thick creamy, sea-foam head. It dissipates to a thin film of creamy bubbles, and the lacing is exceptional: a sheath of sticky web. The color is a mixture of deep dark ruby red, and dark rich earth. Think of an Irish ale mixed with dark mahogany. The beer smells of bitter chocolate and a hint of citrus. The taste is amazing, but it took me a while to pick out everything. Slightly tangy citrus tones, mixed with toffee and caramel sweetness, and a bitter chocolate finish ... it's all in there. At one point, I swear I tasted a hint of raisins. A good mouthfeel, and a good session beer if you're into complex session beers. Overall this beer is awesome and fun to experience. I highly recommend checking out the Wychwood website, it's full of information and as fun to visit as this beer is to drink. This is my favorite brown ale, hands down.","JuicesFlowing","Oct 15, 2011"

Taste is similiar to the nose, lots of mingling yeast and maltiness, sort of a stale taste...a fairly weak brown ale. Mouthfeel is dry, medium bodied. Overall, I believe this sells well in my market, perhaps to the Dungeon & Dragons fans? but for a beer enthusiast theres not much to like.

Taste follows nose and is a perfectly delicious brew. A good nuttiness and a light chocolate flavor. Finish is dry and earthy with a lingering biscuity breadiness and earth.

Melds into a long lingering burnt sugar/treacle flavor that persists long after each sip. Some Melanoid in there reminds me a bit of a dopplebock.

Flavor upfront roasted malt with a mild nut finish, some sweetness brings in the fruity raisins with a slightly sour bread finish blended with the bittering hops which have an earthy herbal feel. Mouthfeel overall is pretty damn solid one of the best English brown's I've tried outside of Sammy Smith's. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with gentle carbonation goes a long way I like the drying herbal and earthy hop bitterness it is what makes this beer work.

It is medium-light bodied; very smooth with a dry, slightly scratchy finish. It's a simple flavor that's very pulled together. It's slightly sweet, slightly bitter and perhaps a touch sour.

Light-bodied, quite smooth with a creamy texture given its lack of heft. Mixed berry, nuts and a hint of caramel, however, in no way sweet. Here, malt dominates the attack with hops gaining the lead through the finish. The high level of carbonation doesn't disturb the flavor clarity, fits the weight and keeps the brew refreshing. A floral side comes through with the aftertaste. Very tactful and easy to consume.","farrago","Jan 17, 2009"

Amber pour with a medium white head and nice lacing. Medium bodied ale not very filling. Taste is subtle for being a "strong Ale", although I'm finding that many English styles generally are tame. Caramel with a light fruitiness backed by those nice floral hops. Again this ale seems typical with the English way, lightly hearty. A decent one but nothing shocking.","kinger","Oct 28, 2008"

The smell was a nice blend of toasted malts and a toffee sweetness, but it looked kinda weak with its lack of head and thin look when held to the light. However, with the first sip its threat of being watery was shown to be completely unfounded. The mouthfeel was smooth and sweet, with comfy flavours of malt and chocolate, a nice buttery toffee, which then gave way to a nice clean hop bitterness that lingered slightly but was very refreshing.

Flavor is in the same boat with the weakness. Just tastes like it has been watered down. Tasty malts and hops, though, with just a hint of diacetyl towards the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and not sticky at all. Almost a little too light, though. This is decent, but I won't go out of my way to drink this again.

The first sip isn't really much to write home about for me. Middle of the road maltiness with slight tastes of dark fruits and also a slight iron/heavy mineral water flavor that got stronger as the beer warmed a bit. The beer is light and actually refreshing.

Good balance of bittering hops with a background taste of salty sulfur towards the end to give a semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Tried it when it first hit Mass. and liked it right away.

The malt flavors are there, more in a caramel than a bready range. This is a medium-bodied ale, which seems to carry a lot of flavor for its weight.

The taste was somewhat creamy with malt sweetness followed quickly by fruit-derived sweetness with a subtle toffee & caramel notes underneath. The finish was dry and slightly bitter.

Pours like water and looks like a standard brown and I got a ok head of off white fluff. After the head sank quickly I was smelling the beer and it has a slight sulfur smell that distract from the decent malt. Drinking it is somewhat of a challegne as it is yet another slated British beer, not too bad like Sammy Smith's but I think the sulfur smell might come from one of these. The hops are pleasently mild and the malt was not too malty and I am quite sure there was some adjuct sugar used in making this. At least this beer is thin so I could chug the rest.

The taste is a little wild. There's a lot more going on in my glass than I thought there was. The overwhelmingly sweet malt flavor is definitly in command of this ship, but there are some hops, raisins, dried fruit and nuts, and maybe hints of toffee and chocolate as well. Almost one too many flavors crammed into a bottle. Interesting, though I'm not so sure all the different tastes in this beer are mixing well on my palate. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, maybe more. It could use a little more carbonation. The intense flavor gives this beer a rough drinkablility. I'd have a hard time knocking back a whole lot of these.

The head retention is fairly good, and it holds well before dropping to a standard collar and whispy surface covering that leaves minor spotty lace about the pint. The nose reveals dark fruit (plum/prune, red grape/raisin); a smear of buttery diacetyl; an edge of iron-like minerals; and a dusting of dark chocolate. It's smooth and light across the palate with a delicate carbonation and medium-light body. The flavor is not as rich as the nose might suggest, but its lightly vinous fruit appears first on the palate, followed by some light notes of toffee, and some mild diacetyl and leafy hop in the finish. It's quite well balanced, and the bitterness simply balances what not-particularily-sweet malt is there.

After a normal pour a beige/cream colored head was formed, light cloud like texture not very dense, lasted some time but not overly long then it falls to a light ring on the edges. There was some lace present, mostly in presented in creamy sheet form. The aromas that came from the glass were of chocolates, caramels, dark malts, roasted nut, fall leafs and some earth tones. The tastes were much like the aromas, it started off with a dry leaf landing on the tongue, followed by roasted nuts and malts, a sweet caramel taste comes in and leaves just as fast, light bitter chocolates through out, earth notes/tones as it heads to the back of the throat then gets nutty as it leaves. The aftertaste was mostly malty. The overall impression of the taste was it started off on the dry side then slid into a watery feel the rest of the way.

I get raisins and cream off the initial sniff above the rim. Unctuous caramel, sweet coffee, fresh butter and ice cream, vanilla; in short, my perfect malt--just enough sweetness without being burnt. I smell a little chocolate, but it is not predominant. I can smell the salinity of the water in this beer as well; sea salt. Taste is wood-toned alcohol at first for me, which I found odd. Subsequent sips reveal definite butter, some light cinnamon, bbq-like spiciness at the back, along with the roasted sourness of the sweet caramel malt. The yeast makes itself known in the fruity ester and vanilla richness. Excellent balance with the hops in the finish, adding just enough dryness to balance the malt, with sweetness edging out bitterness just by a margin. Floral grassiness as the aftertaste. Creamy, with carbonation at a minimum. Very drinkable on an Autumn day or a cold Winter night, or even in the summer, and I imagine it would pair well with Indian food.","Cwrw","Dec 07, 2004"

Chocolate, caramel, and toasted malt can be found in the bouquet, there is a definite sweetness to it, although mild. Light flowery hops are hiding behind that, although become sharp on occassion. The flavour really comes out once it warms up, a honey sweetness with toasted malt in the middle, herbal hops on the finish, and a return of the sweetness to accompany the hops on the aftertaste. There is an astringent character that lingers on after everything else fades away. The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but it rolls over smooth until the aftertaste becomes sticky and herbal. This ale runs the gamut from sweet to astringent, and is not shy about it. My lasting impression after finishing the pint has all of that sweet malt forgotten and has me feeling like I've been chewing on dandelion leaves all afternoon.

4.03,7.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"First off love the label and bottle design! Wychwood certainly has some colorful labels. Hobgoblin has great deep brown color with very little head. Taste was really good most dark beers taste heavy but not this one.","Reverand","Mar 08, 2002"
3.77,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Murky, dark amber with a slight lace. Initially fruity nose gets lost in a sea of malts. Toasted hazelnut malt body finishes with a hint of hop and fruity-ester. Creamy-mellow form makes this Brown a drinker.","inebrius","Feb 27, 2002"
4.25,13.3,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A really nice, malty brown ale.  A slightly buttery flavor, combined with a smooth chocolate taste, made this beer very easy to drink.","AaronRed","Jan 15, 2002"
