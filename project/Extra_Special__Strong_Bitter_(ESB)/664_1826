It pairs best with spicy food or any type of food doused in hot sauce. I know for an English Pub beer you're probably thinking really, spicy food pairing? Trust me. Spicy peanuts, steak with your favorite hot sauce, or even sushi with spicy sauces are what you need to bring the most out in this beer. Its not nearly as bitter as the name would suggest and the color is not as dark as you would suspect either. Its just a good beer.","Big-Frog","Jan 09, 2014"

While not a session beer per the classic definition, this is something you could enjoy for pint after pint. Compares quite favorably to Fuller's ESB. I have to credit this beer to turning me on to English bitters when I first tried it a couple years ago, and it's something I still go back to every now and then.","gr0g","Jul 06, 2013"

At first I felt there was an aftertaste that was slightly offensive but as I continued to sample the beer I could no longer detect it and that gave way to a very enjoyable beer. The malt flavor is the highlight of this libation with strong British character. The noble hops and British yeast contribute their roles and play them well as second fiddle. By the end of the beer I am left wishing I had more; not for tonight but another that I wanted a nice British ale. To improve it, I would like to see a more pronounced head and something to clean up the slight DMS aroma that is present.","Jenks","May 09, 2013"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, best before 3/22/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, toffee, and light herbal. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, nuttiness, pear, apple, biscuit, toffee, molasses, light earth, and herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, nuttiness, light fruit, biscuit, and toffee on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of flavors that are quite robust; zero cloying after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Overall this is a damn nice ESB offering. Great balance of fairly robust flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyed this.","superspak","Oct 25, 2012"
4.04,6.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Wells Bombardier pours a clear ruby-brown with a small cap of head. The aroma is awesome and just what I want from the style. It's got an assertive, but not overwhelming amount of caramel malt, along with some nuts, bright fruits and a touch of pepper. The taste is a little less assertive than the nose and comes on gently with a bit of caramel before revealing everything from the nose at once - the caramel and nutty malts, the bright fruits, and the bit of pepper rush right in, leaving a nice, flavorful yet mellow aftertaste. Maybe a touch too much on the fruits, but otherwise solid. The mouthfeel is a touch over-carbonated, but otherwise nice. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a great ESB from a style I'm increasingly realizing I'll never fully unlock without a trip to England.","shand","Oct 23, 2012"

Refreshing quality about this beer served up in a 14.9 oz/440 ml can. Way cleaner and more enjoyable than a New castle inline with a Fuller's but yet a bit more easy drinking. Assertive English hop character, mild fruit, bready caramelized malts coming through to balance it out, along with an earthy bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, even sturdy carbonation flowing smooth, I can't complain about anything while drinking this beer.

Wells Bombardier is a fresh-tasting offering, cold from the fridge, and as it warms a bit, as with any good ale, you can feel its glory. I agree with other reviewers - glad this was not a widget can with a nitrogenated head. Doesn't need that. The head is fine, the aroma of malt and English hops plenty evident. The only bitter I can compare this to from my limited experience is Fuller's ESB, which I have had quite a few times on tap in Canterbury Ales in Huntington, NY. So far the malt and hop flavor profile of ales in the bitter family are among my absolute favorites in beerdom. You will get that one-of-a-kind malty, aromatic goodness even from this can of Bombardier. Perhaps the only thing better is real ale, freshly casked from the brewer; barring that, give this a try. Very recommended.","angusdegraosta","Dec 30, 2011"

Medium-bodied, the carbonation starts churning from the first sip and shows no signing of diminishing until the bottle is empty. Places itself squarely in the middle ground, no favoring the toffee, chocolate or nutmeg spice or, conversely, the lemon citrus, pressed flowers or field grasses. That said, there's a noticeable metallic, streamwater aspect, which may be the most bitter thing about it. Not so bready here. Clings to your mouth pores, not sticky like honey, more so oily.

A wonderful session brew, and one I will surely revisit when I get sick of Urban wilderness and the Sam smith pales and organics.

Tastes as a strong bitter should -- lots of caramely, cookielike malts with a soft hoppy bitterness in the finish.

The flavors are similar to the aromas but seem to bring them out more as the malts seem to really be alive with a biscuit flavor, the fruit highlights pear and apple.

The beer looked very good in the pint glass, as the copper colored body was absolutely clear, and the head atop was nearly two finger thick and sticky. I know my bottle was fresh, because the store owner had cut open a newly arrive case and handed it to me, but I did not realize how fresh until the hoppy aroma hit my nose. Quite a bit more aromatic than most other English bitters I've sampled so far. The earthy pungent hop smell was quite detectable, even at an arm's length. The taste was where the Englishness of the beer started to make itself known. The bitter-spicy, mineralized, dry, and musty taste was typical handiwork of an English yeast strain. Not much citric brightness was seen here, like that typical in the American interpretations of the style. The mouthfeel disappointed me a little, as it was tinny and marred by an almost metallic aftertaste. Not as good as Fuller's version from what I recall, but it's been a while.","rajendra82","0"

Minimal aroma is helped by a nice (but very light) hop profile in the flavor. I know English ales are subtle, and that's what there is to love about them, but this is beyond subtle.

A little island of foam floats in the middle, in the shape of Belgium. Sheeting lacework. Typical light english aroma, what with the lack of head. Fruity and malty. It's still a bit cold. The fruitiness grows as it warms. Ripe brown pear, strawberry, caramel, pale malt and a bit of floral, spicy english hops. Juicyfruit gum fruitiness as it warms to room temperature. A hint of chocolatey roastiness. The flavor opens with grainy caramel, immediately fruity, perfectly balanced by modest floral, earthy hops. Tingling carbonation. Very nice. Somewhat lighter bodied, feeling thinner that american counterparts. Sessionable as hell. Modest hop presence in the finish, with that familiar goldings character. Some spicy hoppiness.

Kind of reminds me of nettles (anyone else ever had a nettle beer?). The mouthfeel is average, it holds its weight but gets a little caustic towards the finish. This does stay true to form for an English bitter, but after one pint it's not really my cup of tea anymore, I'm ready to move on. I do like that sturdy bottle though, perfect for homebrew.","IronDjinn","Jun 27, 2004"
3.53,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Never heard of this beer when I found it at Whole Foods near my London Pride. I figured it might be a crappy imported lager, but it also might be interesting too. I poured the .5L botttle into my tall pint glass. It pours a rich amber red with a tan foamy head. The aroma is lacking in hops but there is a rich nutty malty smell. The taste is definitely British. Nothing like the American ales I've been having lately. There is a ton of rich malt, biscuity, nutty, very refined. The bitterness is strange -- bitter but without any hop flavor. And yet not bitter enough to hold up against the sweetness of the malt, which carries on after the last gulp. Medium bodied. Smooth. The lack of hop character is the main drawback to this pleasantly surprising British ale.","oggg","May 06, 2004"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A dark amber colored liquid with a nice light tan head. Deliciously fruity aroma but not an overpowering one. The taste starts with a grapfruit sweetness. That sweetness slides into a spicey middle with a smooth bitterness on the finish. This was my first English cask ale when I arrived in England. Definitly a good way to start.","ybnorml","Apr 15, 2004"
3.98,5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice ruby color with a creamy well sestained head that leaves a small amount of lacing,aroma is subtle on the malty side with touch of fruit and biscuit.Taste is mellow but with some nice flavors,malt tilted for sure with some flavors of dried fruit and some metallic notes in the finish.I could drink these all night and it has a pretty cool looking bottle to boot,thank you Liquid Solutions!","oberon","Apr 15, 2004"
3,-20.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Catching slightly onto my late tendency to prowl round paris' english pubs, Bombardier at 'the Bombardier' (right off the pantheon) seemed like a fine idea. Pours dark brown with the same pace and head you'd ask for in a stout. The smell and taste, not very complex and oh-god carbonation lacking english beer, are very bitter (er what'd you expect?), overwhelming the rest of the taste itself. It's well above other english products though, and I could certainly have another one.","Andreji","Mar 25, 2004"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Hand-pulled cask at the Bag O' Nails pub near Buckingham Palace in London. Amber/brown color with a medium thin beige head that did not last long. Thin coating of lace throughout the glass. Subtle malt and caramel in the nose. Medium-bodied and smooth like glass with a woody character. Flavors of dark fruit, malt and hops. The finish is smooth and rather creamy. I liked this one pretty well.","Dogbrick","Mar 24, 2004"
4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It pours a copper color with a rocky head. The aroma is fruity and there is some caramel as well. The body is creamy and malty with a touch of nuttiness and some caramel. It finishes with a pleasing grassy hop finish and a lingering fruitiness. A very nice session beer.","ark57","Jan 17, 2004"
4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"What makes it individual, however, is the curious aftertaste  its almost like celery. Another reliable session beer, well worth trying.","Doiv","Dec 12, 2003"
3.53,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Lingering bitterness is the distnguishing characteristic of this beer. Certainly worth a try.","TerryW","Nov 17, 2003"
3.46,-8.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Not bad, though probably not something I'd actively seek out. A nice trip into the English ESB, and if I saw it elsewhere, at a reasonable price, I might consider it.","beergeek279","Nov 02, 2003"
3.44,-9.2,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Beautiful brown/redish brew with a small head reminiscent of the style. Once open, I got an incredible fruity/sweet smell that disapear once the brew was in my glass. Bitter tasting with a sweet aftertaste. One of the best bitter that I had the chance to drink recently. Will try to track more C.Wells product...","Phyl21ca","Oct 14, 2003"
3.51,-7.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I ran into the regular tap version of this winner at a newly discovered "English Bar and Restaurant" in Moscow. While it is better cask-conditioned, I wasn't disappointed by this pint either. The brew came out a deep burgundy under a creamy tan head wiht good retention and very nice lace down the glass. There was almost no nose whatsoever - just a hint of malt. The mouth was semi-prickly and fairly light. There's nice hoppiness here from the start. Not American IPA hoppiness, mind you, but a good firm bitterness complemented by smooth malts and a touch of sweetness. The finish is bitter and enticing, while the malts mount a comeback in the aftertaste that smoothes out the edges and leaves you wanting yet more.","Globetrotter","Sep 20, 2003"

4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Dark red hue, thick head, intense lacing. Some biscuity and malts on the nose. A very clean body; medium indeed - hops are detected up front with the bitterness, they go together well in this bad boy. Smooth and carbonated throughout, with some pleasant bitter malt detection. A great ESB!","GeoffRizzo","Jun 23, 2003"
3.83,1.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Comments  I tend to like a heavy bitterness to my ESBs, although it is not necessarily a requirement of the style. I wouldnt favor this one from a personal standpoint, but many fans of the style will enjoy The Bombardier. If you like your ESBs smooth, a little on the lighter side, and not overpowering (read, anti-Rogue Brutal Bitter") then give this a try.","RoyalT","May 06, 2003"
3.82,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Draught somewhere in London: This one pours a clear amber color with one finger of a frothy off-white head. There are some caramel malts to the nose, with a faint whiff of some citrus hops. The taste is good. A decent caramel malt body, with no sweetness at all. A touch of citrus and lemony hops. Slightly bitter finish. A nice brew","Boto","Apr 25, 2003"
4.08,7.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Thick, persistent dense light beige head sits atop a clear, tawny garnet hued brew. Tattered sheets like of foam trail. Notes of sweet biscuit and brown butter upfront in aroma, with understated rounded floral hops. Hints of earth and plum esters add a subtle fruity contrast. Fairly clean and stately aromawise. Hint of roasted grain and biscuit bitterness is perceived initially in flavor, then is ensued by a combination of mellow butterscotch and toffeeish dark caramel. Hop presence darts in mid palate, but integrates well and offsets malt sweetness, lending overall balance slightly skewed towards hop bitterness. Both hop flavor and fruity esters are rather subdued, being comprised of mild, damp flower and fig, respectively. Lightly bodied, but not thin, with a softly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes with pleasantly lingering notes of bread and butter. A near epitomy of balance, and a very tasty ESB. Bombardier is a brew I would have no qualms with drinking all day long.","marc77","Beers"
4.03,6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Copper coloured, enormous thick head. Nutty flavour with a distinct but nice bitterness. Most best-selling English "bitters" are not bitter at all, but this one is. The first time I tried it I found it too bitter for its relatively light body, second time it was just right, delicious! Great for a hot day too - why stick to lager in the sun when there are decent bitters around? Bombardier may not be a true masterpiece, but it sure is a decent and well made thirstquencher.","Sigmund","0"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a limpid deep ruby color; the head pythonic in size, frothy in texture, and a light tan color, as it dissolves the lace left behind forms a thick sticky sheet. Nose is mostly malt, fresh, crisp and clean, sweet caramel with the start sweet malt, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish has a perky acidic bite, the hops splendid in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste, quite a quaffable beer in its own right. Been looking for a bitter to have on hand as the temperature climbs here in the desert, by George I think I found one, now I need to get my packy to stock it!","Gusler","Dec 05, 2002"
4.47,17.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice clear copper color under a thinnish head that did not leave much lace. Aroma was earthy, healthy, and fruity. Substantial mouthfeel, and a very smooth finish that blended malt and hops efficiently. A good cask ale which checks in at 4.3%. Glad I tried it.","Mark","Nov 06, 2002"
3.7,-2.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep amber colour topped by a nice creamy head that stays around for a while. Aroma consists of malts and caramel. Flavour is bitter and also moderate caramelly. Average to poor caronation. A very impressive English Bitter","ipogios","Apr 05, 2002"
