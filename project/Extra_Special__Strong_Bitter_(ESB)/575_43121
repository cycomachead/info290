4,42.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Foster's Premium Ale brewed by Foster's Group Limited, with an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a deep amber color with a nice white head. I like the color of this brew.  The smell is rich with grains , malts, and sweetness. You pick up on a hit of hops at the end. Now for the taste it is bold, but rich with flavor. Foster's Premium Ale, has a nice sweetness to it. There is a lot going on in this brew.  I think this is one of the better Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB). Foster's Group Limited did a nice job with this one. There is nothing overpowering in Foster's Premium Ale. This brew has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice rich and bold. I like how this brew goes down smooth.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 08, 2015"

3.39,20.6,4,3,3.5,3.25,3.5,"I actually am enjoying this beer. It poured a nice Amber color with a thick head that left lacing in the glass. The smell was average and the taste was better than average in my opinion. I tasted a little dirty grain hiding behind the malt and hops. Other than that, I'd gladly drink a few of these at the beach!","Bigalduncan64","Feb 14, 2015"

3.14,11.7,3,2.75,3.25,4,3,"Overall, this isn't anything bad. I'd rather drink a pale lager or some of the malt liquors out there than this. It is 5.5%, so it'll get the job done after 3 cans. But, I think some lagers and malt liquors have more consistency throughout a can/bottle. This one just had the weirdest bitter, grainy, yeasty flavor. It got better as it warmed, but I'd just rather drink the Foster's Lager. Foster's Premium Ale gets a 79/100 for me. It's not terrible.","ThomasMetal75","Dec 08, 2014"

3.13,11.4,3.5,3,3.25,3,3,"Aroma is a bit funky and grainy. Pour is nice clear light Amber with a full white head. Head dissipated quickly, but left attractive lacing on the glass. The taste is better than the smell, however, it is bitey and grainy. Best drunk ice cold, it becomes more bitter and less fulsome as it warms.","CaptJackHarkness","Nov 24, 2014"
