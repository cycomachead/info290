3.81,-1.8,,,,,,"Single bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. A clear but dark mahogany brown with a finger or so of frothy off-white foam. Aroma does deliver a nice ESB or brown ale character: Raisins, hazelnut spread, brown sugar, grape, and a topcoat of earthy, citrus rind evoking hops. Ample malt complexity and fruity esters on the palate, although there are more than enough hops to dry things out and keep this anchored in bitter territory. Some interesting flavors emerging, dusty toasted cinnamon, orange, treacle, bruised brown apples ... Fruit and spice in equal measure. Diacetyl asserting itself. This is a tasty brew ... On the malty side but not cloyingly sweet, fairly thick for the style but finishing rather dry. Would repeat.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 28, 2014"
4.1,5.7,,,,,,"Poured from bottle.  Aroma is a nice mixture of caramel, chocolate, and coffee.  Appearance is a clear amber with slightly off-white head.  Taste is a medium bitter. Body is somewhere between medium and full. Creamy texture, with average carbonation, and a bitter finish.  A very drinkable ESB with just the right amount of bitterness.","Nightwing","May 18, 2014"

4,3.1,,,,,,"Pours a solid dark brown with a decent sized off white head. Toffee, caramel, and dark fruits with just a hint of earthiness. Medium body moderate carbonation. One of the better ESB's that I've had.","johnnnniee","Jan 19, 2014"
