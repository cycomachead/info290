Generally I find English Bitters way over-priced and pretty boring, but this one is full on flavour and a very decent price. An equivalent price of 24 x 330mL case for AU$55 (2014) is almost unheard of for something this good. Surely this must be an introductory price, as this is a new ale to Queensland...","SmashPants","Aug 22, 2014"

ADM Montagu nodded in approval as I directed the helmsman to bring us alee, starboard of those Dutch bastiges. Color was a deep amber with ruby highlights (SRM = > 17, < 22) and NE-quality clarity. Truth-in-advertising time! The nose was, indeed, quite malty and fruity and the descriptor of "fruitcake" definitely applied to both myself and the beer. The order to "Release batteries!" was given and the ship rocked sideways in the water as I hefted the glass to my lips and let fly. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was semi-sweet, at most, with the malt having done its thing and the yeast having had a field day. The taste was very biscuity and fruity and I could think of nothing but fruitcake. Deelish! In the meantime, we had the bloody Dutch on their heels. Our double-crack'd CANnons left those clog-wearing punks on their heels and they had no choice but to tack away and northward from whence they came. One of our lads incurred a splinter which will almost assuredly cost him his arm, though. The finish was fittingly dry and as we headed for safe harbour, I toasted our brave lads in a job well done.","woodychandler","May 11, 2014"

A tasty ESB with great malt and nicely balanced hops.

There is more of the same as you take that first taste, although these flavors quickly fade to a drying moderate bitterness revealing a respectable underlying hoppiness.

Sweet malts, very subtle dark fruit, and a hint of breadiness commands me to take a sip. Malt sweetness, a hint of hop spice, and candied fruits abound in the palate, with a finish a touch dryer than anticipated. Medium mouthfeel, no obvious flaws, and the desire to have another (which really is the hallmark of a good beer). Well done.","Idris","Jan 08, 2013"

Mouthfeel is good for this traditional English beer but from a bottle.

The taste is a delicate mix of the intricate aromas and a surprising warming for a brew at 4.7% abv. Hops provide balance only, exhibiting a subtle pine hint here and there.

The nose delivers earthy, leafy, and grassy hops over a caramelish malt. It's full bodied and creamy in the mouth with a very fine and natural (bottle-conditioned), moderate carbonation that gently caresses the tongue and rouses the tastebuds. Caramel/toffee/nutty malt dominates the flavor, accented by a thin thread of yeasty fruitiness (cherries) and earthy, woody, and grassy hops. It's really well-balanced by a solid bitterness that never steps beyond its supporting role, but anchors the entire production. It finishes dry with some subtle alcohol, a note of yeasty fruitiness, and a residual bitterness that leaves the palate refreshed and ready for food or more beer. Quite tasty!!! And a surprisingly drinkable ale considering it's 6% abv (the draft version is 4.7% abv)! The alcohol remains almost completely cloaked throughout. A bit strong for an all night session ale, but maybe one to get you started! Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Dec 20, 2003"
3.53,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Thick foamy, light brownish tan colored head, that leaves a little lacing. The beer is syrupy brown in color, almost like cola. The aroma is a little bit chocolately mixed with lightly sweet malt. Caramel and sweet malt dominate the initial flavor. I think there's some hops in there that cut the initial sweetness, but they never make themselves fully known. A good, flavorful beer, a bit on the sweetside, but not too much.","HappyHourHero","Nov 03, 2003"

4.3,12,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"On cask at the famous White Horse in Parsons Green. This stuff rocks! A dark amber coloured brew with a white cap of foam. The aromas are very hoppy, fruity, and very, very, well-balanced. The taste is hoppy and fruity with a nice malt backbone and the mouthfeel is creamy and oh-so smooth. The drinkability you may ask? Wonderful!","francisweizen","Jul 16, 2003"
4.55,18.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"i really never notice that its quite strong, even for a traditional english ale, but that is yet another thing about broadside that makes me give it consideration every time im in the mood for a top quality beer from the u.k. i cant wait to head over there next year and get into some of this from the keg!","diablo14","Mar 26, 2003"
3.08,-19.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"The beer is a brown color with a hint of amber to it. I had to try real hard to get some head out of it, and it dissapated right away. Maybe some fruitiness to the nose. Not much else. The taste is mostly a medium maly sweetness. I also get the taste of alcohol: suprising since the beer is only 6.3%. Maybe some bitterness at the end. It is almost trying to be a barleywine, but it doesn't really impress at all.","Boto","Jul 14, 2002"
3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This totally British Ale is dull gold in color and possesses a moderately smooth, herbal malt with woody notes. Amply hopped with a complex blend providing some tea, citrus and hints of metallic bitterness. The aroma is fresh and pleasantly malty. This is a mild ale, well balanced with nothing jumping out. The head bubbles are larger than expected and dissipate rapidly. A well-made ale.","BeerResearcher","Jul 10, 2002"
3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pretty good. Quiet smooth malty flavour, quite a nice caramelly roasty flavour, a bit sweet, but balanced by a decent bitter finish, i kn dof like it, quite smoooth aswell, decent.","rastaman","Beers"
4.07,6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I tried this at the famous Whitehorse pub in London. A mid-brown beer that was very very smooth. Hops were on the restrained side and there was hint of fruitiness. I found the flavor lacked distinction but it was very very drinkable. Lace was non-existent which accounts for the lower appearance ranking.","Mark","0"
