3.17,-17.9,4.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Sweet finish, with some very soft, apple-like finish with moderate carbonation. A solid beer of its style. Decent finish, though a bit dry and sparse tasting.","TLove","Dec 10, 2008"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"It smelled of caramel and a slight hoppiness. The taste reminded me of a Scotch ale which has that unique taste to it. It had a nice bitterness on the finish which rounded it out nicely to me. Overall a good ESB and I would recommend it.","cswhitehorse","Nov 08, 2008"
3.56,-7.8,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Conclusion: Not bad, not great. It's pretty on target for a Special Bitter, but it's a little TART and aggressively bitter (without much hop flavor for my taste). I'd really like a FRESH sample to compare this to as I think this beer might have greater potential than shown here.","BedetheVenerable","Oct 09, 2008"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"D: On the whole, this is a well made ESB with a solid taste.","avalon07","Aug 22, 2008"
3.51,-9.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is sweet malts and a good amount of bitter hops. Some leather, minor citrus, and a medium dry finish. Not a bad ESB overall. Quite sessionable considering the 4.5% abv.","Spikester","Apr 05, 2008"
3.98,3.1,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"I enjoyed this. Pretty much everything you want in the style, I just find it a bit typical. Though, I will take a typical ESB over most anything else.","champ103","Nov 03, 2007"
4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A mix bag here - there is some tartness and fruit notes from the hops, yet this fuller-bodied beer goes down smooth and creamy, and has some sweet malt taste to it. Finishes with a dry backbite. A great beer that I'm glad I got to try.","clayrock81","Oct 13, 2007"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice slightly clear ruby red/deep orange amber color with a nice frothy white head that leaves good lace. Nose is mostly malty. Taste has a good malt profile with some decent british hop presence. Almost some toffee or caramel hints in here. Mouthfeel is nice, but a bit thick. Nice dry finish. Drinkability is good but not the best. Overall a good english bitter and a fair representation of the style. Im not that crazy about it, but it is a good representation. I think this bottle may be a bit old. A good brew, but there are enough better bitters available that I probably wont be purchasing this one again, except maybe at a bar.","AKBelgianBeast","Jun 17, 2007"
4.2,8.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"MF&D - A creamy and smooth medium bodied ESB. It reminded me a lot of Sam Smiths Nut Brown. Great flavor, coats mouth well and left a sweet taste on my lips. Highly recommended.","nasty15108","May 25, 2007"
4.09,6,3,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Smooth and very drinkable. Good for warm or cold weather. I could deal with this beer just fine in a session. I hope our paths cross again on this beer. I will enjoy a great many more.","blakesell","May 20, 2007"
3.87,0.3,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This reminds me very much of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. This is a good beer, but is very much a British Bitter, not an American one.","smcolw","May 17, 2007"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability is hampered somewhat by the slightly bitter/sour taste. But otherwise, a nice ESB and probably would make for a good session beer.","BDTyre","Apr 26, 2007"
