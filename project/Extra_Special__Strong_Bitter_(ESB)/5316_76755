Tastes about the same with a nutty quality to the finish. Nice body weight and feel. Decent but nothing exciting.","delta490","Sep 25, 2014"

3.75,2.7,,,,,,"8/10 review....Pours amber medium dark, light layer of white. Light malty nose, caramel hints. Toffee sweet, quite toasty. Slight spices in there too. Very light carbonation and a mild hop burn. Starts strong, bitter a little too pushy.","KTCamm","Aug 19, 2014"

4.5,23.3,,,,,,"Great, easy to drink, crisp. Bitter, but not overly so.  Great with a burger or sub. One of the better ones from full sail, comparable in quality to the Amber I think.","MarkNoseBeer","Aug 03, 2014"
4.07,11.5,3.5,4,4.25,4,4,"Funny...I find myself thinking this is just short of great, but only because it's so solid in appeal. Nothing sharpish or spiky. Solid is what I'm left with & there's nothing wrong with that.","seedyone","Aug 02, 2014"
