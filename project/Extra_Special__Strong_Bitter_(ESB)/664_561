3.41,-12.1,4.5,3.5,3,5,3,"Had this one on cask from Local 44. Pours a light amberish color with nice off-white frothy, milky had about a finger width high. Looks as if it would be served from over in the U.K. Smells of delicate noble hops. Besides that, some light pale malt character. Tastes of pale malts and somewhat bready. Thought it was a little bland as I was expecting more pronounced malt character. Mouthfeel was the best thing about this beer. Creamy, cask flavored English ale. A great session beer to chat over with some friends. Overall, I was disappointed as I was expecting more from the malts & normally characterful English yeast.","jwhancher","Jun 08, 2011"

3.92,1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"M&D: to me the texture is more fizzy than necessary, making this med.-full flavoured ale slightly off-balance on the palate. It reminds me of plenty of Young's ales, all well-crafted, sharing the fruity yeastiness and solid, flavoursome hop-mix using nothing but Fuggles, Sussex Goldings, and Styrian Goldings. A solid premium ale this is, I wish it won't be discontinued with the Ram's moving north...","wl0307","Sep 22, 2006"

3.77,-2.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A nice english bitter. Pours a bronzed copper with an off white head that is a pleasure to look at. Smell is of buttery toffee and light caramel malts, a nice floral hop nose. The taste is smooth and delightful, a creamy taste of milk and caramel with a buttered toast, hops are light but pleasant. Enjoyable.","beertaster13","Dec 13, 2005"

3.93,1.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"500 ml bottle best by August 2005. Poured into an imperial pint glass, this is a crystal clear copper with a big head that billows up slightly over the top of the glass, nice retention, moderate amount of lacing. Smell is a little musty, with some light floral notes and an underlying malt with a slight apple fruitiness. Taste is very mellow--a slightly buttery malt, a gentle leafy hoppiness, and an underlying apple/tropical fruit presence. Everything's nicely melded togather--lingering finish is slightly bitter, slightly caramelly. Medium bodied with a gentle carbonation and a silky smooth feel. This is a real solid ESB, easily a sessionable beer.","cubedbee","Oct 15, 2005"
3.37,-13.1,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"The taste can be described as a slightly above average taste, and has a definite fruity tone. One interesting characteristic I noticed is that after about 10 seconds you get a taste on your palate that feels and tastes kind of like mango. WACK! It should be noted that the date on the bottle says "best before March 05." I'm going to review this one again when I get a fresher bottle, though I don't think this one tasted old. Recommended.","LordChesterfield","Oct 03, 2005"
3.45,-11.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,4.5,"So this is a traditional English bitter? Would love to try on tap. Easy to drink would make a great session brew. An above-average brew that, like I said, would be great to have a session with. Not as tasty or complex as its ESB cousins, but then again, thats why they are ESB's and this is not. Glad I gave it a try, but will probably opt for the ESB next time or the Young's Special London Ale.","bighoppymonster","Sep 16, 2005"

3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Ram Rod is copper colored with plenty of tiny bubbles for carbonation. The good-sized head is creamy and off white. The aroma is an inviting combination of English malts and fruity hops. The taste has plenty of English malt flavor, somewhat earthy, with notes of caramel. Hops provide a moderate bitterness and some dry, fruity flavor. The finish leaves a lingering caramel sweeetness. This is definently an ale I could use as a session beer, there are plenty of very good flavors, but nothing here blows my mind.","Gagnonsux","Jul 26, 2005"
4.15,7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a rich copper color with two fingers of foamy tan head. Really attractive beer. Smell is of sweet, caramel malt, with a bit of herbal character. Big caramel malt sweetness up front, with a little bit of fruity and buttery characteristics. Hop bite is strong and herbal, but not unbalanced or unpleasant in the least. Some have called the hop flavor tea-like, and I can definitely see that. Mouthfeel is slightly metallic at the finish. Really delicious English ale, fully deserving of its reputation. A quintessential bitter and a good session beer.","thechaacster","Jul 10, 2005"
3.92,1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"An amber-orange ale with a nice cap and modest carbonation. Nose carries notes of sweet ripe fruit and a musty earthy tone. Sweet chewy malt up front, subdued hops add tartness to sweet cidery tastes in the middle and the finish gets slightly dry with the bittering coming in and leaving a metalic after taste....Well crafted...a sweet but mellow "bitter" for those who really donÂ’t like bitter ales.","pootz","Jul 06, 2005"

3.8,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Larger bottle sampled, with freshness dating notched on the rear of the label. Pours light slightly orangy amber. White head, minimal lacing. Nose is slightly musty/funky and also has hints of malt. This is a nicely balanced ale, try to get a fresh sample and enjoy its understated Britishness. Notes of caramel, bready/yeasty malt, minerally and smooth in the lingering finish. Wont do much for over hopped beer lovers (as I consider myself) but its a pleasant respite and a quaffable enjoyable brew.","Billolick","Apr 08, 2005"
2.35,-39.4,3,3,2,2.5,2,"After stumbling across Young's Dirty Dicks which I liked, I picked up a bottle of this. I was disappointed. Pours a dark brown, maybe a hint of red. Not much head to speak of. The taste was overpowering, and not a good taste at that. Everyone has different tastes, so I am sure others may like this. I did not find this as something I could drink many of at a sitting, in fact I found that I had to force myself to finish it instead of grabbing something else.","dgthompson","Apr 03, 2005"
3.13,-19.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Medium brown-amber body, topped by a thick, creamy head. Aroma of bourbon malts accented by a slight fruitiness. Flavor is rather aggressive, with a strong wood component. A decent amount of bitterness and hop flavor is also present up front. The finish has a lingering earthiness. Slight amount of higher alcohols present in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, IÂ’m not thrilled with this beer.","aaronh","Mar 29, 2005"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Another value pick-up. I consider myself a Young's appreciater and this does not leave me wanting more. Pours a light orange with a slight tinge of gold. A 2 finger head subsides to a small foam cap. Pleasant albeit weak aromas of toffee and caramel provide a sweet nose. Taste is well balanced starting off with toffee notes before fading into the slightest hop bitterness. Nice and malty this one is. Superbly drinkable and enjoyable. Will be picking this one up again.","soper2000","Mar 26, 2005"
3.73,-3.9,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Nicely hopped, honey and fruity and peppermint and grapefruit. A nice mead-like dark golden colour. Went well with my crew's fish and veggie stew.

Really average flavor wise. Slight sweetness but the ho hum overall flavor slightly detracts from the finish. Decent body. Really just a "plain Jane" sort of beer. Id try some of the other Youngs products first.","lackenhauser","Feb 19, 2005"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Copper color - reddish and very clear in a pint glass. Pours a deep orange with a quickly dissipating white head. Slighty hoppy aroma carrying into a caramel malt aftertaste.

4.02,3.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The beer upon its release from the 500ml brown bottle pours a clarion copper color with a moderate sized semi-creamy light tan head and the resultant lace a concealing sheet. Nose is sweet malt, hints of yeast, clean and fresh to the senses, start is sweet with a full malt profile, top feel light to moderate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops pleasantly spicy and the aftertaste quite dry, a fine ESB in its own right and a style I find pleasing","Gusler","Jan 02, 2005"
3.05,-21.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Time to start the new year off with watching a little football and drinking some beers. This one begins my day. Pours a yellow orange color with a small fizzy head. Smell is kinda sweet and earthy. Taste begins really nice and reminds me a little of Fuller's ESB but after a few sips it really falls apart. There's a bready flavor and some earthy, spicy hops but both are overshadowed by this candy corn tasting sweetness that really gets cloying. There's seems to be some diacetyl here as well. Shit, this was good at first but now I can barely finish it! I think 12 oz would have been enough.","granger10","Jan 01, 2005"
3.57,-8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: which is the perfect segue into this characteristic. Easy enough to drink. I drank the pint in little to no time whatsoever. If you like English Pub Ale's, this is a must try. Solid offering from Young's.","hero27","Nov 29, 2004"
4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Really good beer, perfect for sitting down and putting a few away. Sweet, fruity aroma with bready malts. Carmel flavors with a sweet buttery note. Solid mouthfeel without being heavy. Carbonation was low, but enough to provide a healthy cap of white foam over the clear copper body. Great drinkability, one of the few English ales I really enjoy.","Sixpack595","Nov 13, 2004"

3.63,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This poured an orangey amber color. Huge and hefty head of tan creamy foam. Nice intricate lacing on the glass. Low amount of carbonation. The aroma is bitter, tannic and has some slightly metallic and fruity notes, along with some sharp graininess. Actually, this has the pungent aroma of old wet cardboard. Interesting. The taste is bittersweet with dry and fruity malt base. As the beer warms to room temperature it becomes increasing more flavorful. Solid malt body and a nice dryness emerges in the finish. A nicely pleasant English ale and one that I like to revisit once in awhile.","pezoids","Sep 14, 2004"
4.2,8.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Blood red color with highlights of orange in the glass. Poured with a small white head, and did not leave much lacing. Smells of butterscotch discs, toffee, and something lightly soapy. Taste is dry, with strong butterscotch, grassy malt, and light hops. Mouthfeel is buttery slick, moderate carbonation. A different and delicious ale.","TastyTaste","Aug 24, 2004"
4.44,14.4,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells, though. Smooth and caramel sweet upfront followed by a nice hoppy bitterness--really a nice balance between the two flavors.

4.07,4.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Ram Rod is a quality ESB even if it doesn't overly impress. It doesn't hit you over the head with flavor, but that's all right sometimes. On occasion we all need a beer that we can settle into like an old pair of slippers and enjoy for its simple, pleasant drinkability. This is just such a beer.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 01, 2004"
4.07,4.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pouring from the 500ml a transparent coppery honey, a little brown and a little red. Just what is expected, colour-wise. Brilliant and clear. The head was a healthy size, and has ample duration, churning from two-fingers down to a thin (1 cm) but creamy and complete covering of cream- coloured foam. After pouring it formed quite large bubbles on top. The lacing is screen-like, full, immediately after tilting, then it patches and runs the glass quite quickly. Definitely a better than average appearance. Perfect amount of fruit on the nose, with subtle sweet-honey smells, some dusty smells, caramel, but with subtle but well-balanced hop. The fruitiness is hard to pinpoint--subtle apple, plum, perhaps, and sweeter fruits such as peach. There are also some definite yeast characteristics revealed by the somewhat dusty earthy aromas. I immediately taste the dusty quality too on my first sip, both from the generous hop and the yeast. The finish is exceptional hop flavour--not overdone, but definitely the defining feel in the aftertaste. Three cheers for balance here: the crystal malt leaves the tongue just sweet enough to counterbalance the dryness left by the hops, whilst not supressing the full and robust hoppiness. On the middle of the tongue is the sweetness and myriad fruits, as well as some sugary butterscotch. A dryer mouthfeel, but not so dry that it inhibits further drinking, and all this combines for first-rate drinkability, for hopheads OR maltheads. This would be perfect over a good ploughman's lunch; and it goes extraordinarily well with smoked Jarlsberg cheese, I might add.","Cwrw","Jul 15, 2004"

3.85,-0.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"500 ml bottle, served just under room temperature. Large, fish-eye bubbles compose the off-white head. Large tufts of foam cling to the side of the glass. The color on this brew is a light, dark wheat-chestnut color (woody). Relatively low carbonation. IÂ’m into the aroma, but the beer has to be warm for the smells to come out: English hops, malt, and a yeasty-breadiness. The taste is nutty, with butterscotch and caramel notes. ItÂ’s not really a sweet beer, but has a malt and dough like flavor. Finish is clean and a little flowery. No complaints with this beer.","Suds","Jun 19, 2004"
3.65,-5.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The top of the foamy light tan colored head pocks as it fades to a thin film. Clear, liquid copper colored beer with no sign of carbonation.

An easy drinking ESB, nothing else really stands out.","HappyHourHero","Jun 17, 2004"

It has just enough carbonation and tastes of the malt and fruit sweetness that push through nicely with a good hop bite that brings this brew together.

It was light, clean, and just slightly oily. This beer had a distinct quality about it. The bitterness let you know you were experiencing a classic British Bitter. This was the first I really tried and will have to explore some more.

In the beginning there is a splash of fruitiness that quickly gives way to malt and a little hops but very, very dry. The mouthfeel was crisp and bitter and lingered on way after the glass was done. Overall this beer was very drinkable and I liked the 500ml bottle serving (cool looking bottles) --- like to try this on tap some day.

So far not a particularly impressive beer, although this begins to change a bit with the first sip, which tastes initially of sweet malt and ends nicely with a dry/bitter finish.

It reminds me of blood a little bit and it detracts from the enjoyment of this beer a lot. Finish is very clean with no hops in the finish.

Taste: Upfront the creamy sweet malt profile is entwined with the hop bitterness, definitely one of the better English ales I have had in awhile blends flavors so well. Mouthfeel: Medium a little on the lighter side of the spectrum but carbonation is dead on making each sip nice as the next.

Nose is light all the way, light floral hops, light spices, light hay and herbs, light citrus. Perhaps mild would be a better term. Flavour is mild for a bitter as well, and very drinkable. Floral hops, grapefruit and herbage found in the taste. An impressive ale, but not exceptional, although looking back now, with the well blended mild characteristics I should have scored this higher. Just not bold enough for me to up the ante.","IronDjinn","Jun 04, 2003"

The sweet malty aroma has hints of pears and tea. The complex hops have tea-like, citrus and some fruity esters. The velvety smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel is a pleasure.

A little sweetened orange to the rather subdued aroma, could have been sassier but this is a mild ESB at 5 % ABV...Malt dominates but hops are distinct enough to lend prickliness to the tongue and close.  Light-bodied but a nice sense of light brown sugar and a candied fruit sense mid-mouth.  Not a huge flavor statement in this one, but good balance, pouring qualitities, and taste profile.

4.01,3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Fairly clear, deep-amber body capped by a dense & creamy, very light-tan head that holds well and leaves some thin lace. The aroma is gently malty, softly fruity and lightly hoppy without being real specific about anything. The body is light with a gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor, like the aroma, offers broad strokes rather than detail with a somewhat rich malt that's only lightly caramel in character, a supple fruitiness, some woody notes and a leafy hop flavor that's backed by solidly supportive bitterness. Finishes with a short lingering composite of the above characteristics. Nicely balanced! The great thing about this beer is that it pack so much into so little - light but compelling. Highly drinkable! Best served at cellar temperature (or just below) to reveal its complete character. An excellent English session beer althought the alcohol is just slightly high at 5.0%.

It finishes with a very clean hop bitterness & slight sweetness from residual sugars not metabolized by the yeast. This is an excellent ESB.
