4.27,13,4,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Had nitro tapped.  A good ESB and quite smooth compared to others.  Hazy amber color with a think head, most likely due to the nitro tapping.  Very full bodied and surprisingly not so bitter.  A higher ABV is always appreciated but the smoothness from this ESB made it very drinkable.  Perhaps the best quality of this beer is the execution of the style.  Overall, a refreshing change from run of the mill ESBs.","barfootbandit","Jan 25, 2015"
