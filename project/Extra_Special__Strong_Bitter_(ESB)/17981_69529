4.27,13,4,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Had nitro tapped.  A good ESB and quite smooth compared to others.  Hazy amber color with a think head, most likely due to the nitro tapping.  Very full bodied and surprisingly not so bitter.  A higher ABV is always appreciated but the smoothness from this ESB made it very drinkable.  Perhaps the best quality of this beer is the execution of the style.  Overall, a refreshing change from run of the mill ESBs.","barfootbandit","Jan 28, 2015"

Admittedly, this is not my favorite style, so my rating is really just for my personal remembrance of what I thought of the beer. I am sure this is a good example of the style, or at least better than my rating suggests.","huysmans","0"

Malty mostly with ever so slight hops, lingering malt flavor and a clean finish. Not much going on here, and I am not really a fan. Very boring and not much flavor.

My general complaint with ESBs, are they tend to be on the bland side, and lacking in flavour. No worries here- This beer delivers some very, very intense flavors. Starts with a nice roasted malt flavor/mouth-feel, and finishes with a nice, very bitter, hop bite. I highly recommend this beer and I will look for it again.

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Nice, amber color with a moderate head and retention, mild lacing. Aroma amazingly reminds me of Topps brand bubble gum like the kind that was in baseball card packs from 25 years ago. Maybe even the specific smell of the gum combining with the cardboard from the cards. Talk about memory lane. Taste is mildly bitter, no alcohol noted, mild sweetness. Nice balance and very pleasant to drink.","KickbacksSteve","Jun 14, 2011"
3.68,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4," Nice light hop profile was highlighted by hints of grapefruit and fresh grass. As it warmed it got tremendously more balanced, with a light bready malt character coming through and a light herbal like quality to it. Smooth flavor here, though the hops did seem a touch off to me. Light, with a grapefruit, peach, lemon like tartness coming through in the front and an almost green tea leave like flavor in the mid palate. Intresting mix of flavors here, some biscuit and a touch of light grain coming through now. Smooth, mellow, and consistent carbonation never failed and allowd this very sessionable lager to really be a smooth and easy drinker.","mikesgroove","Beers"

Slight smokey and malt smells, like caramel. The flavor is a roasted caramel, with some slightly bitter hopping. It almost has some coffee notes, as well. Sour and bitter aftertaste, with syrupy qualities. The finish is a bit dry and slick at the same time. Tasty.","GarthDanielson","May 29, 2011"
