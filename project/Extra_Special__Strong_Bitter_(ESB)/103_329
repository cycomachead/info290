It was alright, drink worthy, but nothing that stopped me. The beer has a gorgeous color with a nice white head that leaves carwash lacing. Nose is pungent with cereal and only the mildest detection of hops. The taste is much the same, but the honey very present honeycomb is robbed of its sweetness and is instead replaced with a very cereal, oaty taste that has an iron touch which maybe where the hops come in. I didn't not enjoy drinking it but it never made me think or savor. Good compared to other ESBs I've had but I think the buck stops there.","Klym","Sep 09, 2011"
3.73,-4.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out as a nice golden color with a pretty good looking head on it. The head leaves a little bit of lacing but not too much. The smell of this beer is malty, it's a little sweet and earthy too. The taste of the beer gives off a lot of the same features as the smell. Mostly malts dominate the flavors here. The mouthfeel of the beer is decent, I'd say it's average for an ESB. Overall this beer was pretty good and probably worth a try. I can't say that I'd run out for more right away.","Knapp85","Sep 01, 2011"

It has equal amounts of bitter and sour, makes me think of those Sour Patch Kids gummi candy things. The body is pretty thin but the feel still comes across as creamy to some extent.

3.63,-6.9,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Middle Ages Beast Bitter is a very clear and very lively amber ale with a huge, fluffy, off white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It looks like there's a scoop of ice cream on this beer. It has a very wooden aroma. It kind of smells like an old attic. There is a note of toffee-like sweetness and tart green apple in the nose. It's pretty light bodied and very smooth. The finish is dry, a little watery and a little chalky. It's amply bitter-- wooden and herbal. The tart green apple note is present in the taste. It's slightly sweet but the bitterness keeps it in check. The aftertaste seems fruity. It's not totally pulled together, but it's a pretty inoffensive session ale. It kind of seems like a home brew.","yesyouam","Jul 05, 2010"

There is also a bit of course graininess, maybe a bit husky as well. Most pronounced is the nice bittering hop presence. There is a grapefruity tangy and estery hop characteristic in the background but a more traditional leafy and bittering hop presence up front. The beer is slightly crisp, but not overly so; the beer is moderately carbonated, actually quite carbonated for the style. The beer has a nice balance between cream and crispness and between the drying and leafy hops and the more floral estery hop. The beer is fairly complex and very nice.

Citrus flavor reveals itself as grapefruit. Also detected a hint of apricot present as the brew warmed. Finish is somewhat astringent and lingers. Lively mouthfeel without the carbonation burn. I could see this as being a fairly drinkable brew; however, a little too hoppy for my taste.","Jwale73","Apr 07, 2008"

Very little latent carbonation lingered around. The aroma was well balanced between fruity and bready malt and floral hops. The taste was delicate and subtle, with some toasted biscuit like malts and earthy bittering hops. There was a touch of buttery flavor indicative of diacetyl, but it was well in check and felt quite appropriate here. The mouthfeel was light and smooth with the fine light carbonation.

It seems that cluster and fuggles hops were used in this brew. The taste is fruity up front with a grainy, buttery, bready flavor in the middle and a slightly dry/grainy/hoppy finish that begs you to take another sip.

Smell is tons of sweet buttery popcorn with roasted malts and a tiny hop presence. The taste is less than I had hoped for, but its still good (I think I need to drink it less chiled next time). Its a unpronounced chalky nut flavor with definatley a bit of bitterness, but not quite enough from the hops. The buttery malts come through here too.

A thin collar and broken, thickly webbed curtains of lace stick well around most of the glass. Aroma has a very dulled lemony citrus mixed with a grassy edge and just a tad on the dry side. Taste is a little short lived, mostly located mid palate to the finish is where most of the flavors decide to take effect with a slight sharp grassy hop bitterness with citrus and wood poking around the edges. Malts come through light but present with a dryness of paper. Not all that appetizing to me for some reason, it picks up some strange notes of iced tea, watery cola, and cardboardish things as it warms. Feel is alright I guess, weakened front, thin and a tad watery, but the middle and finish gain some slight fullness and smudges of hopped bitterness and some light dryness fading off, but the thin/watery feel seems to stay within through out the stint of each sip and/or gulp.

4.67,19.7,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"A hazy peach with an impressive off-white white head that sticks around. Aroma is a nice blend of piney/grassy hops and diacetyl. Taste is pleasing and rather complex. Grassy and earthy hops that are slightly spicy. A sweetness appears to be there from the bready malt and the buttery diacetyl, but the finish is definitely bitter. Feel is smooth with a slight hop prickle. Very solid and drinkable. I wish this was local to me, I would drink it all of the time.","waughbrew","Jan 01, 2004"
3.9,0,4,4,4,3,4,"Pours a amber color with a thick head. Lacing was produced during the first half of the drink. The aroma was hoppy and sweet. The carbonation seemed lighter than normal. The flavor was as expected, a bitter brew that pleases the palette. The malt and hops were nicely balanced. The mouthfeel was somewhat dry and had a very minor metallic finish. Bitterness lasted a bit into the aftertaste. Very drinkable - a pure session beer.","Gavage","Dec 23, 2003"
3.62,-7.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Fairly creamy. Medium-bodied. Mild puckering effect from the bitterness. Drinkable, but not one that I'd put on my "must have again" list.","OldFrothingSlosh","Dec 17, 2003"

3.03,-22.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours medium golden peach, with a medium white head that races to recede leaving just a small coating of bubbles, laces is mostly non-existent. Aroma is apple, caramel, some hops, and a bunch of butterscotch. Flavor is a bit fruity, strong butterscotch, and ends with a decent bitter and spicy hoppiness. Medium bodied, quite dry ending.","goz","Dec 07, 2003"

3.92,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The Beast Bitter pours a light amber color with a slight orange hue, kind of like a dark iced tea. The head dissapeared really quick, but there's still a bunch of bubbles rising up from the bottom. It would have been fun to watch if I had used a chalice. The smell is of flowery hops. I really dig the taste, the hops are there but don't leave a bitter aftertaste, but the ringwood yeast is there to mellow everything out. All in all a good beer like all Middle Ages brews, definitely give it a try if you're in Central New York.","HappyHourHero","Oct 17, 2003"
3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Reading the label, I was thinking that this might be one of those overly hopped american style "bitters", which really just seem like another excuse to make an IPA. I'm happy to say it's very british in style, all the way down to the hops. with a decent malty balance","UnionMade","Aug 29, 2003"
3.98,2.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep orange color with cream colored head. This beer has a lemon/lime hop aroma with a hint of butterscotch and caramel. Flavorwise it starts out caramel malt sweet and lemony hop bitter. A good balance is found in a light to medium body. It finishes dry and nicely bitter. A very drinkable bitter.","jeffboo","Jul 09, 2003"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a golden color with a lacey white head; good carbonation. The aroma is sweet with Ringwood yeast and light crystal malts. Maybe munich or vienna malts are used in this one to account for malt flavor and aroma without a dark lovibond. The taste is good. There is that maltiness about it with a medium to heavy bitter aftertaste. This is a medium bodied beer that goes down smooth. A good session beer. I'm not usually an ESB fan, but this is one that I could have a few of and enjoy.","WesWes","Jun 29, 2003"
3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A down-and-dirty session ale to be sure; I think that most of the flavors being understated but complex somehow allow the yeast to not become annoying here.","shirfan","Jun 20, 2003"

3.91,0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a near perfect head and a is a beautiful copper color. Smells a little sweet, but rich. Very smooth taste. There's a slight berry taste to cut the edge. Feels like a litle celebration in my mouth. The taste has a lot of staying power, but is very drinkable particially because of this. It's a good aftertaste and you want to update it.","dwarbi","Apr 20, 2003"

4.18,7.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear amber color topped by a nice off-white head with good retention. Lacing was thicker at the bottom of the glass. Aroma was faintly floral and did not offer hints as to what was in store. A tart citrusy hoppy taste hit me and it was very pleasing. Grapefruit came to mind, nice mouthfeel, and very refreshing. A very drinkable bitter and one I was able to try complements of McCall.","Mark","Apr 02, 2003"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Hops are definitely the dominator in this brew. They are not at the peak of hop intensity, but they are surely there and in numbers. The label says not for the faint of heart, but I think many people could handle this one. It is nice and crisp and very drinkable. The spiciness is deliteful. A nice medium body is as full as I could imagine for the style. This one is a fine brew that makes me look forward to more by Middle Ages. I would welcome the Beast into my company any day.","ElGuapo","Mar 18, 2003"
3.8,-2.6,3,3,4,4,4.5,"Appearance of a typical American PA: somewhat hazy copper color with persistent very thin layer of constant foam-carpet. Smell was fresh and of slight hoppyness; no grain or malt aroma that I could tell. Taste was crisp and nicely balanced: Neither over- nor under-hopped for its style, neither over- or under-sweet. Typical of what I think of as a bitter, only bottled and brewed in Syracuse, NY. Agreed, the label and the name may lead to fool hop-heads: This is no ultra-IBU beer, nor IPA nor even American PA, just a bottled American bitter. This is a good beer that I think can be multi-sampled, even along with other beers.","Hobbz","Mar 09, 2003"
3,-23.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Picked this up thinking that it would be a heavily hopped brew. Wrong. Typical golden/orange pale ale color. Thin head. Faint hop and malt aromas. Very faint hop taste and shallow almost scorched malt taste. A little thin on the palate. Not very satisfying on the whole. If they are going to compete in the hop monster category they're going to have to do a whole lot better than this. The name, the cute label and the misleading allusion to hop bitterness might draw the customer in initially but it won't get a second chance among most hopheads.","mickstepp","Mar 02, 2003"
4.13,5.9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a medieval copper under a quality, gluey head. Bouquet of an orchard alternating blooming citrus and almond trees. Flavor full of toasty pine nuts, earthy lingering hops, balanced and tasty, smooth and drainable. Quality English style brew from Syracuse.","inebrius","Feb 23, 2003"
4.67,19.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I found this to be a very tasty and drinkable bitter that rivals the hoppy IPA's that are out there. My only regret is that I don't live close close enough to NY to get some more once my six pack is gone.","WanderingFool","Feb 11, 2003"
4.12,5.6,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The pour murky deep golden amber color with a magnanimous head, frothy in texture, and the left over lace a nice thick covering sheet. Hints of the hop flower, big on the malts, crisp and fresh and pleasant enough with the front ambrosial, the top skinny. Finish is bitingly acidic and the hops top notch in their spiciness, dry lingering aftertaste and a quite decent "ESB".","Gusler","Dec 30, 2002"
3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Orange amber, full head that recedes but does not vanish. A very tasty, crisp ale from Middle Ages that is quite subdued despite its hoppiness. There is a slight apple tartness upfront that fades into prolonged sweet caramel flavor, and lastly a dry crispness to round it off. A little bit of soap in the aftertaste. The qualities of a traditional bitter are present and built upon quite successfully with citric, lemony hops. Ends up being bolder than most bitters but a bit thinner than most American pale ales. Nice middle ground. A good beer, spritzy, not too flavorful which makes for fine session drinking.","Thrasher","Nov 22, 2002"
4.39,12.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Amber-orange in color with a fluffy white head that holds OK, then drops to a thin collar. The aroma displays a lightly fruity and caramel maltiness beneath bold piney hops. The body is medium with a fine, moderate carbonation from bottle conditioning that gently caresses the tongue and becomes creamy in the mouth as it warms. Very English in character. The flavor expresses an excellent combination of bready maltiness with a gently sweet caramel character and piney/lightly grassy hop flavors. Some light diacetyl helps to round and soften - it's well integrated and unobtrusive. Actually quite nice. Some fruitiness appears towards the swallow along with a firm bitterness. It finishes with a mild lingering bitterness and some sticky residual caramel maltiness, as well as some more pine-like hop flavor and mild diacetyl. It's not a strong aftertaste, but it is long lasting. Very nice. A really enjoyable pint that seems to express itself best at closer to cellar temperature. Well done.","NeroFiddled","Nov 07, 2002"
4.17,6.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"A Bighuge thanks to Pbrian for the sample.","Bighuge","Oct 08, 2002"
4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy, golde, orange color with a sticky tan head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  The brew has a subtle diacetyl tilt to it that goes nicely with the bicuity malt aromas and subtle bittering hops.  Smooth toasty malt from start to finish with some hoppy spikes in bitterness throughout.  The hops have the citrus/piney flavor that is a definite reminder that this is brewed in the US.  The brewfinishes with a quick flurry of diacetyl before leaving a nice bitter hoppy taste lingering on the tongue.  Nicely smooth on the tongue with a mediumd body to it this is one very drinkable brew that I would love to find on cask some day.","Murph","Oct 01, 2002"
3.95,1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This was a nice, crisp, hoppy bitter.  The Ringwood character was much tamer than the Grail Ale, or it was balanced better with the hops.  Either way, a fine beer, maybe a tad thin.","pbrian","Sep 17, 2002"
4.18,7.2,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a light amber color.  It formed a huge sudsy perfect head.  Nice carbonation present.  It had an aroma of hops and citrus.
