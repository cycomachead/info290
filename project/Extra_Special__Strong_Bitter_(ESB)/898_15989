As it opens up, there’s elements of orange peel, subtle woodsy notes, and elements of cacao.  There’s just the slightest trace of bread.  On the palate it starts bright, slightly bitter with flavors of citrus, pine, and an earthiness that’s almost slightly herbal.  The hop flavors are plentiful, the but the malt plays back up, with notes of subtle biscuit, burnt sugar, and toast.  The body is thick, noticeably carbonated, bright, and focused on hops leaning into the bitter side of the spectrum.  The ending comes alive has elements of unlit mild cigars, dried herbal notes, bread, burnt sugar, and hits of citrus pith.  The finish is long and complex.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 28, 2014"

3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before April 2013. Pours slightly hazy ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, pear, caramel, toast, brown bread, floral, light pepper, light toffee, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, pear, caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, pepper, pine, light nuttiness, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of spicy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, pepper, pine, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity ester flavors; with a good hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial ESB style. Nice complexity of malt/fruity notes with hop balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2013"

Alcohol esters and English fruitiness. Taste is caramel malt sweet with a toasted light and roasted dark grain compliment. Holiday spices abound and flow into the alcohol edge. Big hops show here and give an earthy dry finish that has a good amount of grapefruit. Feel is velvety and lightly chewy. Creamy carbonation makes this on highly drinkable.

The aroma skews in the direction of herbal with notes of spruce, pine, and molasses. Taste is pretty sweet with more molasses and spruce. The sweetness doesn't give way to any bitterness and is very sweet all the way to the finish. Not really getting the ESB quality here, this tastes much more like a winter warmer (Which is what the name implies as well). The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat heavy. Overall, I don't feel that this qualifies as an ESB, and it definitely leans towards the sweet side. I would pass on this.","homebrew311","Aug 23, 2012"

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, alcohol, perfume, and bitter hops. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I really wasn't too impressed with this one. There was something about the combination of the flavors going on in this one that really turned it off to my palate. I even let others try it and they agreed that something was off on the flavor of this one that wasn't very palate pleasing.

3.1,-18.4,3,3,3,4,3,"Overall I thought this was a pretty average ESB that really didn't interest me that much. The flavor was heavy on the malts, the malt profile wasn't bad, it just needed more hops to balance it out and it needed more bitterness. I could probably drink a couple of these, but the flavor is a little dull and doesn't hold my attention so I doubt I would want to drink more then one. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty spot on for an ESB. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of hops in this beer, the aroma and taste could have benefited from more hops, the malts are just too dominating for an ESB. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I would much rather have Saugatuck's or Short's ESB. If your a big fan of ESB's you may find this beer disappointing, but if you like malty beers this may be worth a try. I haven't had a whole lot of experience with ESB"s but the ones I have had had a much better hop presence and that's where this beer was lacking. This isn't a bad beer but i just didn't do anything for me, it seems like I have much better luck with the mutiny fleet instead of the smaller format bottles. A pretty meh beer and so far my least favorite ESB, I am starting to think that the better beers from Clipper City come in the Mutiny fleet since I have yet to be impressed by their 12oz bottles.","StoutHunter","Dec 06, 2011"

I thought it was a bit of a mess with too-strong hops fighting with dark fruits and assertive bready malts - pulling in every direction but never quite reaching anywhere approaching good.

Not only was it markedly different than the fizzy head that I usually see from AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers, but its retention was fabulous. Color was a deep coppery-amber with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was initially big with malt, but there was also a good bit of piney hops in the mix. Yum! Mouthfeel was medium with a wild juxtaposition of caramel sweetness and pine hops on the tongue. Dang, but this was really good and wayyyy too smooth. I could see putting a couple of these away before I even knew what had happened. Finish was more hoppy than malty, but it was the interplay between the two that really made this a unique beer. I really should not pooh-pooh bottled beers the way that I had been. I would drink this pretty routinely during the winter.","woodychandler","Dec 28, 2010"
3.75,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"I'm normally wary of anything labeled "imperial" that doesn't have "Russian" to the left and "stout" to the right, especially if it comes from an American brewery-- that will practically guarantee that it's overly boozy and ham-fistedly hopped. However, the imperial part of this beer was nearly absent: none of the usual smelly alcohol; no thick and gooey body; no black-hole gravity; none of the smack-your-face hops. In fact, this was as light and fruity as a good UK ESB and only slightly more alcoholic. 7.50% seems generous, in fact, as there was very little warmth to this brew. Worth a try, especially because it is *not* "imperial" anything.","gfreed","Dec 27, 2010"

Well, I suppose so - no question that they pumped this beer up on some sort of beer steriod - but in that regard it came across like a similarly pumped-up body builder - no balance. Appropriately big malt, but in an effort to keep pace with hopping, the bittering came across as rough and a bit raw. The ETOH similarly was not well integrated into the flavor, and rode atop with a warming harshness.","Brent","Sep 21, 2010"

I found the scent somewhat nondescript with pine and sweet resin dominating. The taate is where this one truly shines for me, an introduction of sweet sugary maple gives way to tart grapefruit and lemon. The mouthfeel is near-perfect, but a touch overcarbonated for the subtler notes. I am very sad Clipper City is not local, as this would be a very welcome six pack to be always on hand.

This is the dominant taste here overall. Hints of bitterness pool in the corners of my mouth. A bit of alcohol present at the top of the throat. This beer is too nondescript to really impress. A solid brew, but lacking bright or deep notes. One saving grace is the strong carbonation. The activity on the tongue enhances the beer's bitter character and impedes the toasted malts from becoming cloying.

The hops give off a scent that's faint but not dead. This is pretty good stuff. Minimal holiday spices with just a sense of hop bitterness in the end. I really cant say that though cause the hops really don't come in at all. The feel is smooth going down with no sight of the alcohol and the carb seems muted, it works well, this is easy drinking.

When you first taste the beer you're greeted by a smooth maltiness. This quickly gives way to bitter hops. The bitterness lingers on after you swallow and evolves to a slightly burnt flavor. It's complex and interesting. The beer has a fuller body than I expected; it really coats your mouth. There's also more carbonation than I thought there would be.

Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. A noticeable dryness is present as well. Tastes of hops up front, then sweet malt, then the nut flavors and dryness are present, an interesting yeast flavor, a slight alcohol flavor come through in the middle, and the finish is again hops.

The smell is some dark fruits with a hint of alcohol. Not much of a hop presence in the nose. The taste is fruity with some yeast and alcohol. There is a slight bitter hoppiness at the end but mostly an alcohol sting. Another reviewer stated this is more like a light barleywine. Since this is billed as a Imperial ESB I would agree but it needs more hops to become a true b-wine. The mouthfeel is oily from the alcohol and could be a little thicker in the body. Drinkability is good for a cold, snowy night. I could finish off a sixer by the fire before bed.","CrazyMacHarris99","Feb 19, 2009"

Smooth and creamy with a subdued malt sensation that is well-balanced with hints of cocoa and caramel. The hops are noticeable too with a leafy, bitter feeling that leads to a balanced beer and a spicy, dry backbite.

Nothing archly bitter about the nose, green hops, spices, meadow-like florality and grassiness, nothing too concentrated, the citrus component starts and then stops, not too round nor soft, just angular enough to stay within category bounds. Medium-bodied, glides well for its consciously semi-gritty texture, the malt eases it into the palate and ably hands off to the hops by the mid-palate. Orange rind, pine resin, hard maple candy, hardly any caramel nor chocolate accents. Never really bitter here too, just keeps you off-balance and plunging forward at angles.

The color is a deep ruby, yielding to light when held up to the light. The aroma is rich with the fresh citrus and bitterness of hops, along with the roasted, mellow notes of malt. The taste is equally impressive. A good amount of bitterness provided by the hops, and keeps the aftertaste nice and clean. The malts provide a good balance of sweetness that round out the beer.

4.14,8.9,3,4,4,5,4.5,"This poured a clear reddish brown with off-white head. Its smell was a good malt and hops blend, and it had the solid taste of a quality IPA that I haven't had in a while. Its flavor was dominated by bitter hops but somewhat balanced by malt. I didn't sense any winter spices, however. It was thick and smooth with a nice aftertaste that was noticeable but not too strong. Overall this was a really tasty IPA, but too "standard" to call it a winter brew.","Pencible","Mar 27, 2008"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"First taste: this is a very good ESB. English-hop bitterness prevails up front and a malty, syrupy, sweetness works its way around the outskirts of the palate. A medicinal, alcohol-rich finish pairs up with bitter, piney hops to coat the back of the throat and leave a lasting aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with a low carbonation level that I'd expect with the high ABV. This is not exactly the most drinkable beer, as it sits heavy in the stomach and gives the palate a hefty workout. However, I could see this staving off the cold with the best of winter warmers and imperial stouts. Good complexity, great flavor, and one I'll definately be having again.","wagenvolks","Mar 16, 2008"

Strong with great balance, like a well-forged blade. Has substance without being to syrupy. The alcohol, for 7.5%, is well-hidden without being concealed by too big a taste, and just adds to the complexity. It actually provides a tad bit of throat warmth during the final sips like a winter warmer/ESB hybrid should. And a well-done one at that.","chiefydawg","Feb 18, 2008"

Winter Storm does live up to the legacy of its style though, an easy drinker for daily use. Heavy Seas' habit of making "imperial" classics is really paying off for me, and Winter Storm works as smooth drinking delicious beer.","manleyphoto","Feb 14, 2008"

4.33,13.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This pours an almost clear reddish-orange with a dirty white frothy head. Lacing is very good. The smell at first is very similar to Sierra Nevada pale ale with some piny and earthy hops coming through. With more time you get a big pale and caramel malt presence. At the first sip the hops hit pretty hard- again, earthy and a bit citrusy, fading into a caramel or melanoidin sweetness at the end. That starts to dominate as you get a bit numb to the hops. The general feeling is that this is a very tasty and easy drinking ESB. I've never had an imperial ESB, but this kicks up both flavors- the hops and malt- to something a bit more intense but yet still balances them very nicely. Towards the end of the glass you pretty much enjoy a more malty beer as the hop presence has lessened. The mouthfeel is slightly slick. This is a type of beer I could find myself having a few of and not getting tired of it.","MiScusi","Jan 29, 2008"

I get mostly malt in the aroma, semi-sweet caramel, with a bit of piney hops mixed in, but nothing overpowering.

A lot of toasty malt and whole wheat bread in there as well with a slight alcoholic touch, very pleasing. On the palate, this one is a hoppy ESB with more fresh hop flavor overplaying the malt tones. While not as bitter as an IPA, it isn't classic ESB either. An Americanized ESB a la Brutal Bitter and Hot Shot, it does have a nice rich lingering sweet malt flavor. Clipper City continues to make some nice imperial beers, would try again.","dreadnatty08","Jan 08, 2008"

I can't beleive this brew is 7.5% ABV. I've been drinking them all week and haven't even noticed. Thin lacing circles the glass. The color is a cloudy amber. Very bitter one-sided taste that leaves a long dry bitter after taste. Overall this is very good and perfect for the long cold winter months.I think they should make the name of this brew more clear. I didnt know if it was called Winter Storm, Heavy Seas, or Category 5" Ale. Alcohol is well-hidden, but is surely there after half the glass was down.

Almost like a hopped up red ale but different malt bill. Not too much depth but very good taste nonetheless. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, finishing a bit dry.

I would call this an American Pale Ale before I called it an ESB. Maybe the malts are a little more pronounced than other APAs, but it's still not balanced.

4.08,7.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Aggressively poured into an Ename chalice, the Winter Storm Category 5 is a deep orangish mahogany with a thick, creamy tan head, that subsided fairly quickly but remained across the the top of the beer til the end. It left a very nice, sticky lace. The aroma is fairly one dimensional, bright and floral cascade hops, that leads me to assume this is dry-hopped. The taste is much more balanced, with a wider range of hops then is evident from the aroma, some pine and grass. Still, it has the rich malt taste one would expect from an ESB, with some caramel and bread notes. There is little indication of the ABV, and the finish is pleasantly bitter, especially if your a hop-head, although you needn't be to appreciate this brew. The mouthfeel on this one is nice, rich and creamy but at the same time an undeniable sharpness from the hops, resulting in a well balanced feel that can easily lead one to drink more of these then they realize. Overall I think this an excellent interpretation of an ESB/winter warmer, in the more extreme manner that has become standard for many American microbrews.","ccrida","Dec 15, 2006"

The taste is very hoppy, but balanced by a nice malt backbone that is highlight by a toffee sweetness that is followed by a definitive alcohal presence.

You can also pick up a heavy dose of hops in this one. The taste is quite a big gulp of malts and hops. The maltiness seems to be very powerful, but not overly sweet. The hops make the sweetness subdued and you are left with a great winter ale. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and thick...which I consider a positive for a winter offering. Drinkability is great.

Clarity is very good, and a moderate carbonation is bubbling from the bottom of my glass. Smell is okay. Solid piney and earthy hop notes dominate, with a ligher citrusyness overlays a nice caramel base with lighter notes of toasty malt. I like it. Flavor is pretty well married with the aroma. Earthy hop flavors dominate with toasty melanoidan malt melding well with it. Solid caramel is in there as well, along with a lighter citrusy hop character. There is just a moderate hop bitter on the finish. I don't think this one quite ranks up there in the DIPA category as far as flavor goes. Things are just not bold enough. Feel is on the heavy end of moderate, with a nice moderate carbonation. It works well for the brew I think. This one is pretty drinkable.

The taste was flavorful with a mild sweetness upfront followed by a stronger hop flavor that grows into the finish. Much sweeter than might be expected for this style, almost liek a barley wine. The hops just were not as dominant and everpresent as I would have liked, especially for this style. Quite tame and mild, but still enjoyable.","jaluria","Mar 14, 2006"

The aroma is of some floral hops but not as intense as I would expect for a double IPA. There was also the smell of lemon and a touch of malt character. Overall pleasing. The taste of hops is a bit more intense than what I smelled and it also is a bit peppery. This beer has a medium body that is enjoyable and never gets too heavy.","ggaughan","Feb 22, 2006"

A bit of oil on the flat of the tongue. Not overly bitter, but a nice lupulin bite. Md-light body and moderately carbonated.

The high alcohol and hoppy taste, probably is the main factor. Whatever it is, it works out great, not having either characteristic overpowering the other. For a stronger beer, I think it's well balanced and goes down easy. A little too easy, which is why it could be dangerous.

Great head retention. Good amount of patchy lace is left on the sides of the glass as this disappears. Citrusy and floral hop aroma hits you right away in the nose. Hop flavor jumps out right away, followed by some caramel malt. Floral, citrusy, and piney hop flavor. Bitterness is not overwhelming. Medium body, low carbonation. Very enjoyable and well balanced.

It did have the typical IPA characteristic of leaving my mouth very dry, though. Also featured the typical dark amber color of highly hopped beers, with a frothy head.

The hops are crisp and sassy, and never over the top, even though they did tend to hog the limelight a bit. The ABV is manageable, and it reveals itself enough to make sure you take note.

The nose displays clear, grapefruity and piney hops, but it's not overtly bold, and the flavor is very much the same way. Its lightly caramelish malt works in unison with its firm bitterness and floral/citrus/pine hop flavors to deliver a solid, well-rounded and well-balanced beer... but it doesn't hit you on the head. It does leave it quite drinkable, however, and the only thing lacking is enough complexity to keep you coming back again and again.

The hops are certainly there in the finish - long, lingering and bitter. An interesting mix of flavors, and somewhat more complexity than I was expecting. Certainly not the hop-bomb expected from a Double-IPA, with more malt character than others, which I happen to like. And while you can taste the alcohol, it's not exactly a "big beer" either. Not really a beer I would drink all night, but not a bad change of pace from my usual favorites. All said, a unique brew well worth trying.","apintofknowledge","Apr 18, 2005"

It certainly is hoppy but sorely lacks floral hop aroma. Also, it doesn't seem to have a fruity malty backbone as most ipa's do (albeit they are more hoppy than anything else).

The aroma has a very pronounced citrus like hop to it, was able to get a good whiff of it just from the pour. Also can notice a caramel malt aroma that is in the background but definitely goes very well with the other scents. The taste was not dominated by the hoppy characteristics as I thought it would be. It seems to be very well balanced, definitely hoppy, no doubt about it, but the maltyness has a very strong showing. Over all this is a excellent brew, one that I will be looking for.

The head collapses down to a rocky terrain as I drank this and scattered lacing was left around the glass. Aroma is full of citric and pine hops with a slight bit of caramel that made it self know once this warmed a bit. Big taste of citric bitter hops of front that is balanced by an eventual slightly sweet caramel. More balanced than I usually like my double IPAs but it works out well here. Taste ends with dry grapefruit bitterness. Body is about medium but a little lighter than I would expect. It works here though were as a Stone Ruination it kind of detracts from it.

The mouthfeel was very crisp and although this brew was full of deep and rich sweet fruits the taste finished pretty clean and dry. The one thing that got me is that this is considered a Fruit/vegetable beer --- I mean, this is more like a souped up Pale Ale with incredibly nice characteristics to me... When I think fruit I think #9 (which I don't like). I really like this and it's being blown out at $3.99/6 pack. Ummm, I'll be back for more.
