3.78,12.2,4.5,2.75,4.25,3.5,4,"Drinkable. Amber in color. Little bit of hop profile to it. Goldings and Cascade hop variety. I like it.","303beer","Mar 29, 2015"
3.31,-1.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Nice Amber color, thin thick head, mild nose of malt with a touch of hops. Taste  is average. A hint of bread on the front with hops finishing this off. Overall an O.K brew","Stubbie1","Mar 27, 2015"

3.19,-5.3,3.25,3.5,3,3,3.25,"I'm guessing this sells more because of the label than the beer.  Its ok.  The beer pours a clear amber with white head that is leaving a spotty lace.  The smell is bicuity...and the taste is a lil sour/bitter.  The mouthfeel is lighter in body with poor carbonation.  Overall....its ok.","WoodBrew","Mar 17, 2015"
2.74,-18.7,2.5,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Pours a medium amber producing 2 fingers off-white, shortlived head that leave a flecks & wash of filmy lacing. Aroma is thin; malty (caramel), faintly fruity & mildly acetic, with earthy & herbal notes (burley tobacco). Taste is watery malt, tart candied apple, with a hoppy bitter character up front that rapidly balances with the malt. Malt dissipates in the finish to a dry mildly bitter/astringent, lightly metallic aftertaste.  All of the British ESB I\'ve ever encountered are watery & thin. Muted aroma & flavor might best described my experience with this one.","mothmanscott","Mar 17, 2015"

3.56,5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall pretty good, typical British ale style beer, nice malt profile, typical yeast profile, decent hops, although wish the hops came through a bit more, but pretty much right where it should be. nothing too special going on either though, just average ale.","jlindros","Mar 07, 2015"

3.35,-0.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The pour was a murky chestnut brown with a light orange hue and a frothy off white head. It possesses notes of toasted malts, caramel, a hint of dried fruit and a light floral hop. This brew starts with a nice malty caramel flavor and a touch of fruity sweetness that lessens slightly, giving way to a mild hop backbone. A smooth, tasty and easy to drink brew... https://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReview","KajII","Mar 05, 2015"
