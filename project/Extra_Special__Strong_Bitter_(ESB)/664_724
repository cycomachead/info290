4.15,5.1,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"A - Cloudy Amber poured into an IPA glass. Head diminished but left about a finger's width in the glass. S - nice fruity aroma with hops coming through. T- beautifully balanced beer with light fruitiness and hops in just the right proportion. Hard to believe it is over 6% BV as I couldn't detect the alcohol coming through. M - again spot on with carbonation limited enough to keep a smooth almost creamy feel. O - overall this was a lovely beer which could be a great session beer even given the strength. I'll be drinking more of this.","Decko","Feb 22, 2015"

The mouth feel is very nice and has a bit more co2 burn then you would expect from most British beers.

Sort of like seeing a species go extinct. As a touch of irony the Chairman, Charles Yound died on Sept. 17, 2006 just eight days before the brewery closed. Was it worth it to go grab the bottle? Well I guess so . If this is retired, I have to wonder how old this bottle is. I paid $2.79 for it at my local Northcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA. It poured a light copper color with a slightly dingy head and not much lacng. Nose was of hops and citrus. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and and lively carbonation. Flavors were odd.

Leaves little patches of lacing. In the nose, there's a fine balance of toasty, biscuity, bready malt, herbal and floral noble hops, and some butterscotch tones. Noble hops and toasted malt intermingle quite nicely, both coming into the flavor at about the same rate, and consistently sticking together. Finishes with some slight buttery tones and a robust bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a somewhat smooth carbonation, which could've been a bit smoother.

Serving temperature is key here - 20 minutes out of the fridge is a good place to start. Having finally reached the ideal temperature in the last quarter of the glass, I suddenly feel duped. I should have waited! This must be what hop-heads are afraid of - having to actually probe the complex subtleties instead of being bashed over the head by the lupulin mafia. Eat a raw clove of garlic with a jalepeno pepper, and you'll be sure to miss the flavor of anything else that enters your mouth. I'm getting a sweet wort and marmelade flavor, with a light cracker element. Time is limited to figure this one out and enjoy it.

It's darker, fuller looking and that translates into the aromas, flaovors, and body. Very malty for the style. Though bittered well, the hops fade behind the bold caramelized malt.

It laced the glass quite well when tilted. Looks quite lovely. Plenty of fruity esters on the nose. Perhaps some faintly noticeable candied fruit and a bit of caramel, as well. Taste is pleasant with a bit of hop bitterness in the middle, then finishing fairly malty with a lovely sweet malt finish. I just love the British hop varietals in this style. And the sweet malt is pleasantly so, not overpoweringly sweet. The mouthfeel is very smooth and enjoyable, and drinkability is fantastic. I feel that I would very likely buy this again.","SilentSabre","May 12, 2006"

4.52,14.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The initial pour is clear, pinkish copper under a fairly short-lived off white head that survives as film and collar and generates some pretty nice lace rings at first. The secondary pour brings out the sediment, generating a slight haziness but none of the chunks I feared after reading the import label (or the actual label, for that matter, which recommended leaving the sediment in the bottle.) The nose is sublime, with sweet fruity (plum) malt and spicey hops well combined. The mouth is very well-carbonated and just a bit sticky, coating the tongue and palate with brisk and prickly viscosity. My goodness, this is good. The grain is distinct, leaving a bready impression. There's also some plum or grape here. And lots of hops flavor, from acidic spice to refreshing floral. The hops win out by the finish, leaving the tastebuds awash in crisp, dry, enticing dryness that begs for the next sip. Very enjoyable indeed, despite the strength.","Globetrotter","Apr 29, 2006"

The aftertaste is quite remarkably balanced, and leaves me wanting more. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and a nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is a great session beer as the flavor is interesting without being in your face.","KarlHungus","Apr 22, 2006"

The flavor is excellent it begins with the same earthy and spicy bitterness that overshadows the rich malty background that has a sweet yet carmelized malt flavor. It finished with the bitterness lingering yet finishing clean. This has a great mouthfeel as the dextrins allow for a creamy mouthfeel yet the carbonation level gives abite that balances the body.

I has a light redish-amber hugh and a thin head that lasts with lacing all the way down the glass. A sniff from the glass will reveal a strong, but not overpowering, aroma of fruity esters you'd expect from a quality English brew and earthy-spicy English hops. In the mouth you recieve a very rich and malty brew (hints of roastyness there with the malt) with substantial and lingering bitterness and more nice earthy-spicy English hops. When I think of quality English beer, this is the kind of beer that comes to mind. This is something that I can always depend on when I want something that won't dissapoint. I gave this breer a 4 for drinkabitity because, while this beer is so strong in both flavor and alcohol you won't want to drink a lot in one night, you'll enjoy sipping on a little all night long.

Smells are malts and hop spiciness. Tastes are buttery, nutty, a hint of dark fruits, hop bitterness, alcohol and some yeast. The flavors are blended well, hard to pick out individually. The bottle says they used a phenomenal amount of hops but I suppose their presence subsided over time. Carbonation is perfect, very smooth with a slightly thicker mouthfeel. I could easily drink another bottle or 2 but I'm sure I'd be feeling it at 6.4%.","mmmbeer","Jan 12, 2005"

Brew was poured to a real nice somewhat dark amber color with a solid creamy white head that had very good retention leaving solid lacing through out the pint. The aroma is yeasty with a sour/tart aroma that seems to mix very well with light but prevalent caramel maltyness. The taste is good, definitely have the malt like tastes but can also notice a slight fruitiness, toffee and butter like characteristics. Has a little hop to it but is not pronounced. Could be due to the previous brew I had which was much more hoppy. Over all this is a fine brew, at 6.4% I guess it is not a session like brew but it is smooth and easy drinking. Over all this is a very solid offering!","Stimack","Jan 08, 2005"

Lightly floral aroma tinged with fresh malt aromas. Very soft mouthfeel. Fruity flavors, with some diacetyl and some lightly spicy hop flavors up front. Finish is slightly alcoholic, clean and fairly bitter. Perfect mouthfeel and body, not too carbonated or too light in body.

Smooth and rich display of toffee and darker caramel, darker and bolder tang found here then with some. Subdued and rounded malts, eager though with a barely there hop of wet grass. Ensued chewy aspects in its body and feel, smooth and creamy with a large malt proflie. Somewhat bready as well and a great full and malt laden rich body feel.

The head is very good for an ESB, bone-white, fine-bubbled foam, and creamy lacing. For its style I think it poured with an unusually massive head, but I am not complaining. The aroma is spicy yeast and hops, with caramel malt. The spice hits the nose with strong herbal and peppery smells immediately. Butterscotch, cream, nuts, much vanilla, light candy sweetness, with detectable alcoholic notes. Pine needle or tree-like hop character. The aroma reminds me of vanilla ice-cream, and is very mouthwatering. The taste is caramel on the front, and deliciously bitter on the middle and finish. The aroma did not suggest THIS much hoppy dryness in the taste. On the front you can taste the numerous fruity sweet yeast sensations: raisins, maple syrup, cinnamon, tapioca, and caramel. Phenolic finish along with the dominant grassy aftertaste. Mouthfeel: high carbonation, full bodied, and gaseous. The dryness with the gaseous carbonation make this an ale to consumed slowly and occasionally. A champion of ESB, this one is not to be missed.","Cwrw","Jun 24, 2004"

Though not bad there is not enough complexity in the base beer to stand up to the little critters. There is quite a bit of hop bitterness in the finish, and there is still a slight malt sweetness in this beer as well. Actually this is quite interesting because I can still taste the hop flavor notes of this Pale Ale, this is interesting because there is not Lambic that I know of that with such a fresh hop character.

This brew actually reminds me a bit of a very low octane barleywine, which is nice, since it's only 6.4%. Smell has the typical english hop aroma.Very nice caramel scent and nice alcohol warmth. Some biscuity malt aroma in there too. Taste is fairly sweet & malty, hence the barleywine refences. Lots of caramel maltiness, and buttery finish. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky but not syrupy. Good beer, but not all that drinkable. A bit too thick for quaffing.","avylover","Aug 14, 2003"
3.92,-0.8,4,4.5,4,4,3,"Poured a murky tannish-brown - to be expected for a bottle conditioned beer. Striking aroma of orchard fruits. Assertive flavors of caramel malt and almost over-ripe apple, like a caramel covered apple. Other bright but quite ripe orchard fruit flavors lurked in the background. Slight tartness tended to balance the malty sweetness, with a bittersweet finish. Overall quite a good beer, but suffered a little in drinkability due to the fruityness.","Brent","Aug 05, 2003"
4.22,6.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a slightly off-white creamy head that falls on top of clear golden/bronze colored ale. Nose is heavy with fruity overtones...almost a Belgian quality to it. The taste is a firm fruitiness backed by ample malty stealth & a damn near perfectly balanced hoppiness. Finishes smooth with some dryness among the malty flavors...a harmonious paring. Add it all up and you'll get a deliciuously drinkable bitter ale, one of Young & Co.'s finest offerings! Worth looking for, superbly balanced.","beerluvr","Aug 02, 2003"

Pours out with an aggressive foamy whitish head that subsides after a couple of minutes, but leaves an impressive lacing down the glass during the tasting. Nose is ever so faint, light malt, light floral hop, a bit of metal, somewhat boozy. Flavour is balanced, sweet malt counteracted with the floral hops, a slight acidic aftertaste. It goes down smooth considering the alcohol content.","IronDjinn","Jun 01, 2003"

2.89,-26.8,4.5,3,2.5,3,3,"This brown pint bottled bitters, poured a very clear dark copper approaching a light amber. It had a nice white head that lingered long into the drinking session. Much lace clung to the side of the glass. The aroma was pretty almost nonexistant. If I held the glass to my mouth and breathed into and out of the glass, I got a little matliness and some dirt/grass kind of sensation. The flavor is hard to describe. There is some malty sweetness but it finishes sour. There is not hops bite or taste. The mouthfeel is medium with a slight creaminess. I don't think I could recommend this beer to anyone. The Best Before date is the end of October 2003 so it is not old brew. I might try another bottle some other time to see if this was a bad bottle or just BAD beer.","LarryKemp","May 29, 2003"

Softly pleasant nose fruity, candy sweetness with hints of caramel, stray hints of hops, malt. Inviting. Pleasant palate, fruity with well-placed bittering hops, some caramel notes, malt hints too, slightly sweet. Definitely British. The fruitiness took a few sips before it grew on me and once it did, what an enjoyable beer. Slick carbonation, medium bodied, somewhat tacky the aftertaste is a blend of sweetness and hints of bitterness, nice. Another dandy from Youngs, try one.","bditty187","May 22, 2003"

Although the taste is nice, I encountered a bit of metallic taste that didn't mix well with the nice sweetness of the beer. At 6.5%, the alcohol is also noticeable.

It has a very full aroma of pale hops and is quite refreshing. The taste does have some bite to it but just the right amount. The malts leave a sweet kiss that is in perfect harmony with the hops. It is very well balanced in flavor. It has a slightly carbonated mouthfeel but still goes down very easily. Since this is a Millenium Edition it is not for drinking all the time, not to mention it costs $2.50 for a pint bottle, but I would if I could.","tang214","Mar 28, 2003"

3.68,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,5,3.5,"Youngs Special London Ale (Millennium Addition) pours a clear light copper color with a very large cream-colored head. The faint smell of an earthy grain and light hops make up the aroma. At first taste, you notice the creamy mouthfeel before anything else. Then you get the very light taste of faint malt fading quickly into a hint hops. Very light flavored for a heavy bodied brew and it finishes slightly sticky. This is a warming beer even though its only 6.4% ABV, and drinkability is affected by this. Still a nice brew, but just once in a while. You can tell this beer is put together well, but it is just comprised of bland ingredients. Youngs can do better. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 11, 2003"

Nose is lightly toasted sweet malts, floral hops, and a bit of fruit. Fruit flavors are thick and juicy up front blended with sweet malts. Bitter citrus notes and hop resins balance against the sweet fruitiness very nicely. Some dry grainy notes are present in the finish. Medium to full bodied and the hop oils create a slick mouthfeel. This is a very well balanced brew with some of juiciest fruity flavors Ive ever tasted in a beer. Another winner from Youngs!","Morris729","Feb 08, 2003"

The head is whitish, but not much of it. Leaves a thick lacing on the side of the glass. Very nice, very sweet aroma, not unlike candied apples. I didn’t like this after the first sip, but it really grew on me. The initial molasses sweetness fell away, revealing a much more complex brew, with very prominent malts, balanced by understated hops. Very nice beer.","jackndan","Dec 15, 2002"

Taste is a bit more hoppy and bitter than most Young's beers, it is also on the sweet side and some buttery notes were evident. Another winner from Young's my favorite brewer.

4.42,11.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear, deep amber with a bright-white creamy head that quickly settles into a thin but solid foam which leaves Belgian- lace throughout the pint. The aroma is cleanly malty with some light caramel, and displays the classic house yeast character as a faintly tart and lightly fruity (berries, apple). There's a fairly distinct aroma of earthy Fuggle and Goldings hops. Very inviting. The medium body and fine, moderate carbonation leave it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is of a semi-sweet, lightly honeyish, bready, and mildly nutty malt (Marris Otter), balanced by an aggressive bitterness and earthy hoppiness. The finish is not as hoppy as might be expected, but long lasting with a gentle maltiness coating the tongue. The alcohol is well hidden within the flavor but tends to make itself known towards the end of the pint. A classic!","NeroFiddled","Jul 29, 2002"
4.22,6.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The clear, orange / copper hued brew is topped by a head that quickly settles into a thin, but tight layer. The aroma is an entcing mix of caramel, nutty sweet malt and fruity, almost fig - like fruity esters. DIstinctive, pungent, earthy Fuggles hop nose from the apparent dry hopping. As the volatile hop oils dissapate, a hint of diacetyl beocmes apparent. The hop bitterness is fairly assertive, but is adequately balanced by a firm, lightly nutty Brtish pale base malt backbone and medium crystal malt sweetness. Biscuit flavors become noticeable as the beer warms. The signature Youngs fruity ester profile is quite pleasant and couples well with the earthy fop flavor. Finishes w/ dark toast and residual sweetness coating the tongue. SLA is highly drinkable and flavorful ESB that epitomizes the style.","marc77","Jul 29, 2002"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy amber color, due to the abundant sediment from bottle conditioning, with a thick off-white head and plenty of lace.  Rather unique aroma, consists of malts, dark fruits, earthy notes, and a slight herbal or medicinal quality, though this last is quite subtle.  The taste is very smooth, with sweet toasted malts dominating initially, followed by fruity notes, and ending with very well-measured hop bitterness and yeast flavors and a smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol flavors are also prominent.  Though I know many will disagree, I often find that the use of hops in brewing is rather heavy-handed.  Hops should complement a brew and not dominate it, and here they do, playing off well against the strong malt backbone.  A fine ale, worthy of the connoseur.","Pegasus","Jul 27, 2002"
3.7,-6.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Semi-aggressive carbonation that foams quickly when first pouring. Tawny bronze hue with a very faint haze from the yeast, light tan head drops down to a thin lace. Woody aroma with hints of hops and a musty grain showing some faded sugary sweetness. Thick and slick mouth feel, smoothness has to force its way through the viscous body. Juicy fruity and a tad buttery with a thick maltiness which brings a heavy hand of sweetness. Hops are bitter enough to counter the sweetness as well as a spicy alcohol. Ripe fruity flavours throughout. Drying husk toasted grain in the end. An eclectic strong ale that would be better paired with a rich meal than to drink it alone.","Jason","Jul 01, 2002"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice golden orange color with a thin frothy head that quickly subsides.  The aromas are malty with some slight hop undertones.  The taste is of the malted barley with some rather aggressive (for the style) hops working in the background.  A nice hop bite for an english ale.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy and the brew is nicely drinkable.  This beer was a bit surprising as it does have a nice hop character to it that most english ales do not have.
