4.15,5.1,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"A - Cloudy Amber poured into an IPA glass. Head diminished but left about a finger's width in the glass. S - nice fruity aroma with hops coming through. T- beautifully balanced beer with light fruitiness and hops in just the right proportion. Hard to believe it is over 6% BV as I couldn't detect the alcohol coming through. M - again spot on with carbonation limited enough to keep a smooth almost creamy feel. O - overall this was a lovely beer which could be a great session beer even given the strength. I'll be drinking more of this.","Decko","Jan 01, 2015"

This is a clear exception, and well worth seeking out if you enjoy traditional English ale with a bit more omph than usual.","Chris_Burton","Oct 09, 2014"
