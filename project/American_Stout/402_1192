4.07,3.6,4.25,4,4,4,4.25,"DATE TASTED: April 4, 2015... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: the Easter vigil is upon us--and my Lenten sacrifice is over... APPEARANCE: dark brown, thick and rocky head; thins but stands moderately still as the pour finishes; dark black body... AROMA: some rum fragrances early; peaty and sweet, with some woody notes; some chocolate and milk as well... PALATE: soft and smooth, with some lactic qualities--holds a reasonable aftertaste but doesn’t intrude; medium-bodied and subtly creamy... TASTE: a nice blend of lactic chocolate and darker, malty flavors; drinkably agreeable without being thin; good balance of alcohol and flavor; the woody hints are just that--a pleasant brew for the early spring months rife with wind and rain; just a touch of vanilla makes this end with a peaceful atmosphere .....OVERALL: I first drank this years ago from a holiday sampler, but in seeking its standalone, I find it a worthy first beer after a long Lenten journey; an all-around balanced stout with enough nuance to stand out...","dacrza1","Saturday at 07:18 PM"

The vanilla is more obvious in the nose and but builds in the flavor with repeated sipping, eventually becoming a tiny bit too strong.   Lightly sweet sweet-bitter balance.","chinchill","Mar 23, 2015"

The pour produces almost 3 fingers of moderately lasting, tightly bubbled, foamy, mocha head that leaves a streaky speckling of lace. Aroma is dark malt, roast, smoke, dark semisweet chocolate, woody vanilla & undertones of figs, prunes, tobacco & thin floral hop tones. Taste is wood, vanilla, dark semisweet chocolate, roasted (burnt) malt & smoke followed by toffee, figs & faint coffee. Finishes much like the rest of the sip but rapidly develops more intense bitterness, smoke & burnt notes in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with medium carbonation, creamy, chewy & wet with a tiny spice prickle in the finish.","mothmanscott","Mar 01, 2015"

The nose presents smoked malt in small proportion and quite a bit more hops than is common in the style. Vanilla is the predominant flavor, but the malt complexity is awesome and layered. Oak presence is light and sweet, I'm guessing a pretty quick aging process. The body is a bit thin for a stout, and for the richness of flavors. It seems watered down to me, but the flavors are awesome. My first beer from old dominion is a hit.","StonedTrippin","Oct 17, 2014"

3.94,0.3,4,3.75,4,4,4," The flavor of malt is dominant with a yeast flavor trailing at first with noticeable vanilla and some sweetness with a mild caramel malt flavor and subtle roasted barley core with more vanilla adding to the base with yeast adding to the complexity as it warms. There is perhaps a little raisin and light spice in the finish with low alcohol flavor. Overall this is a very good stout -pretty well integrated vanilla makes me think it is used to augment the 'oak barrel' as the name implies but smooth flavor and easy to quaff at the 6% strength","Slatetank","Aug 05, 2014"

So overall, very good in some aspects and weak in others making it an above average stout in my opinion. Not sure I would want another one in an evening, but I think with food like steak or even dessert a second glass would be welcoming.","damndirtyape","Jul 27, 2014"

The smell is strong with vanilla beans, chocolate, malt, roasted barley -- excellent. The predominant aspect of the taste is definitely the vanilla beans -- a perfect amount of carbonation makes this very easy to drink. Had this with some hamburger sliders w/ onions and pickles and it was a great match. Highly recommend.","oldirtycaffrey","Feb 25, 2014"

This remained true, even though they kept the body and the feel so light and easily flowing. While the flavor was there, in its meaty, peaty smokiness, the aroma fell a bit flat. We missed a lot of those heavy, oaky butters that you’ve come to expect in any oaked/barreled beer these days. That said, this guy does its style a bit of justice, as pleasant “single” stouts are becoming scarce. This beer will hit the spot if you’re in the mood for cleanly executed simplicity, but it likely will not become your new favorite. As always, as this is a new brewery to us, we remain excited to see what else Dominion has got in their arsenal.","TheBrewo","Nov 08, 2013"

Pours out to a clear, apparently filtered dark black, forming a modest dark brown head with average retention and good lacing. moderate carbonation, ~2.5 carbs. The nose is predominately burnt sugar, lots of black patent, a touch of smoke and potent vanilla. No hop character in the nose. The mouthfeel still feels thin to be, medium bodied but thin with a dry finish. Burnt sugar, ash, coal water, vanilla, no real oak flavor, finishing dry with smoke in the aftertaste.

Some oak flavors with chocolate and malt. Slightly bitter finish with more sweet vanilla. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied...especially for a stout. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is very interesting. Quite sessionable for a stout with so much flavor. Lacking in the mouthfeel...but also in the ABV...so it goes hand in hand.

Aromas of big caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, toffee, roasted malt, oak, toast, light coffee, and light smoke. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, smoke, roasted malt, toast, toffee, and light smoked ham. Slight roasty bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, oak, toast, toffee, and smoke on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; very pronounced but balanced oak flavor; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. It feels a touch on the thin side, but it’s not detrimental. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oak aged stout. Nice amount of robust flavors for a 6% beer with a nice balanced smoke complexity; and extremely smooth to drink as expected. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

Mild roast and vanilla beans with some american oak tannins cutting through. Dark fruits and some cocoa powder rounding out the aroma. The flavor profile mimics the nose. Tame, mild roast that never really approaches bold or robust. Vanilla bean sweetness peeks out in the finish, accompanied by dry, toasted oak. On the lighter side of medium, watery in spots. The oak and vanilla beans are the real bright spots here, but this guy just lacks some body.","ColForbinBC","Oct 13, 2012"

The mouth and nose follow a main trail of malt dark chocolate. Side paths lead to a coffee flavor. Noticeably in the back ground there is a woody flavor? The result of the Oak barrel? I do not know but wouldn't be surprised if it were. The finish is smooth not crisp or dry at all.","Theheroguy","Oct 07, 2012"

The recipe boasts peated malts and vanilla bean, but I didn't really get either of these items in the aroma or taste. On the nose, a pretty standard stout, dark roasty malts, some milky sweetness, and a vegetal woody quality. About the same on the palate, dark malts, sweet and roasty, oak, earthy hops in the distance, maybe a vague hint of vanilla somewhere in there. Medium mouthfeel, pretty smooth and fairly drinkable. Not what I'd call a go-to or anything. Might be better if the smoke and/or vanilla actually came out from hiding, but overall it's still a solid stout.","Rifugium","Jun 06, 2012"

3.95,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"An opaque black-brown brew with a fair light brown cover and good lacing. I can smell a mild citrus licorice idea here. There’s a bit of cocoa/charcoal to make for a pleasant but subdued enticement. The taste buds pick up on tart charcoal and tasteful chocolate with a touch of orange/citrus bite. The body is medium-ish but it is a bit aqueous. I get a slightly resinous malt finish that also suggests some earthy juniper brightness. Carbonation is tiny, spritzy stuff that flows smoothly and makes for a very decent stout that could prove pretty sessionable. Recommended.","Durge","Nov 13, 2011"

Nose is that of vanilla, coffee, barley, chocolate- with the vanilla and coffee really coming out front. Very smooth though- not bitter. Taste is a little on the thin side for me. It just lacks that oomph that the best stouts have. It's tasty, just not quite put together how I'd like. Feel is the same- too thin for the style, and a little on the fizzy side. This is probably the weak point of this beer. Overall, a good beer, but not something I'll probably seek out again. Still, it's worth trying if you've never had it.

There definitely smokey undertones….and flashes of anise/black licorice. The body is decent….right on the borderline of being too watery for me.

Taste- brown sugar first, thick carbonation, brown sugar, oak vanilla on the end. Kick ass! So much going on here. Zero alcohol detected here at all (its not a big ABV beer, but this is pure flavor with no heat). Mouthfeel- nice rich carbonation, smooth medium bodied stout.

Popping the top I get a combination of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, almost a roasted malted milk ball smell. This is a new one for my olfactories and is quite pleasing. This brew pours to a motor oil color and consistency with a tan, yet transitioning from darker to light, head consisting of multi-sized bubbles ranging from medium to small with a pillow top. Head laces as it recedes. On the taste the mouthfeel quickly stands out as highly viscous and silky. The taste then starts with a milky roasted flavor, that slowly ascends to a sweeter chocolate and vanilla, then transitions to a smoky bitterness that still remains sweet in the background. The finish stays bittersweet throughout. This is a delicious brew, I highly recommend.","mooseisloose","Apr 23, 2011"

The roasted malt flavor is pretty weak but it does exist in the background. The mouthfeel is really creamy and it was really really nice. This was really really tasty.

3.55,-9.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a near black color with a small tan film on top. Very little lacing. Smell is very subdued. Some roasted malts and a little chocolate and coffee. Chocolate malt, although mild, is the most dominate flavor in the palate, followed by lactose sweetness and a kiss of oak from the oak chips that were added. The oak character is nice because it is subtle and doesn't hide the other flavors like some stouts that are actually aged in barrels. The thing is, there isn't alot of other flavors. The vanilla beans get lost completely and there is no prominent hop flavors. Also, the roasted malt and coffee in the nose, doesn't really show up. Yet, the chocolate and oak are enough to make it work. Medium bodied with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and rolls around nicely.

I don't exactly pick up on the vanilla but it may be responsible for some of the residual sweetness, taste is more like a milk stout. Exceptionally easy to drink and delicious. My only complaint is naming a beer aged on oak chips "oak barrel stout". Just a touch misleading.","KickbacksSteve","Feb 18, 2011"

Taste of a little smoke, chocolate, roasted malts, no oak, and only slight vanilla when breathing out while tasting. Even at 5.2% ABV, the alcohol is noticeable....aaand that sucks.

The smell is nice, but kinda toned down. Its pretty damn woody with a sweet kick of vanilla and brown sugar. The flavor falls kinda flat. Its missing a big velvety richness. Theres just a thin vanilla taste with an oaky finish with a Dr. Pepper flavor somewhere in between. The body is extremely too thin. It really ruins any chances this beer has at being smooth and creamy. The body isnt even enough to give the sharp carbonation something to struggle through. It has a very prickly feeling. A very dry finish is very abrupt. In all this beer is pretty drinkable. I wont have a problem finishing it, especially at this 5.2% ABV.

Prominently roasty with a blend of heavily kilned and mildly charred malts, the added vanilla bean character is noticeable and quite enjoyable. Oak isn't particularly noticeable on the nose, which is surprising given that this was aged on chips rather than barrels. Bitter chocolate and coffee appears as this beer warms up. The palate is just as good as the nose with a very enjoyable level of roasted malt lending a blend of coffee, a little char and the base grain itself. Sweetness is low, apart from the moderate vanilla character that appears mid-palate, there's not much by way of sweetness here. Medium-light in body with soft carbonation, this feels pretty smooth on the palate. The finish is long and bitter with plenty of roasted grain and a little char present.

It pours a straight black-brown topped by a finger of quickly-dissipating light ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and I think there's a pinch of cinnamon in there as well. The taste consists mostly of roasted malts, cocoa powder, vanilla, and brown sugar. The sweetness is curtailed, but so is the roastiness, for that matter. Everything is a bit dry and subdued. Not much oak character in there either. This all isn't to say that it tastes bad, just not nearly as good as it potentially could. The body is a solid medium, with a lackadaisical carbonation and a stiff, though smooth, feel.

4.32,9.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown color that when held to the light displays some deep ruby colors and suggests a clarity to this brew if it wasn't so dark. The head initially formed with a finger of tanned bubbles that receeds to a very thin cap and sticks in patches of lace about the glass. Aroma includes some favorable scents of dark grain suggesting chocolate and coffee along with the sweet scent of vanilla pushing straight through the back making itself easily noticeable. Further investigation of the nose reveals some hop character and a bit of the woodsy oak notes. The flavor of this brew follows along with what the aroma indicated. Dark roasty grain flavor upfront with a touch of hops. The dark grain flavor includes chocolate and coffee character along with a strong vanilla flavor and a finish that has a noticeable amount of alcohol and an interesting mixture of burnt grain/vanilla sweetness and an oaky/woody dryness that urges you to continue to sip this brew. As it warms, the base grainy flavor seems quite fresh and is enjoyable. The flavor it leaves in the mouth is reminescent of walking through a grain mill. This is a taste I usually only get at the local brewpub, enjoyable to say the least coming from a bottle. Medium to full bodied with a modest level of carbonation. The inclusion of the vanilla bean could be tamed a little more to make it more subtle but all together it works. Pretty decent brew, would have no problem enjoying a few of these.","stakem","Jun 24, 2010"

Onyx black liquid, nary a trace of color to be found. Vanilla certainly there in the nose, fudge-like, milk chocolate, coffee ice cream, minor touch of grains and baking dough, lacks the second tier of scents to display full expressivity. Medium-bodied, comes across as too dry and fluffy to make a direct impression, the carbonation gives it a soft and feathered texture. The dryness highlights the coffee bean to espresso and darkens the chocolate flavors, nuttier and higher overall roast. The vanilla more powdered here but maintains a strong presence.

The aroma presents this dark malt sweetness with a hint of vanilla. The vanilla flavor is even more pronounced in the taste, seeming almost overly sweet and almost artificial at times. It is lightly carbonated and has an overall smooth mouthfeel. Despite my acknowledged bias, I have to admit that this is a decent stout that would be a nice (albeit unspectacular) addition to any beer-drinking session if only for the interesting balance of bittersweet dark malts and added vanilla and oak flavors.","devilben02","Sep 19, 2009"

A bit of vanilla, maybe some coffee. A little light on flavor, and very light overall. That is the biggest flaw. It lacks gravitas, and it needs a lot more carbonation.

The hops are very subdued, just a little bit of bitterness on the finish, a bit lacking on the balance that the label brags about.

Light in body, hardly any chew going on, simple roasted chocolate malts and some hints at roasted coffee beans. The carbonation is insane, the way over-the-top carbonation hurts its body and mouth-feel. Subtle notes of vanilla, sweet wet wood and lemony sourness on the finish. This one was a disappointment.

The beer is balanced with hints of dryness and although it goes down somewhat silky, it has a moderately dry backbone. Roasted, toffee, caramel, and chocolate malts all make their way in the taste.

Roasted malt in the nose with a hint of (unless it's just because I read it on the label) vanilla. Taste is at first smoky malt, then sweet (though not too much so) roasted malt, with a bit of hops bitterness--just enough--warmed with a bit of that bourbon flavor from the oak barrels.

On first sip you get a mix of sour and glazing bitter richness which is all up front. There is a carmalized malt feel that draws out nicely on the palate. Brief vanilla notes are found if you search.

It isn't bad, but there is just this edge that I personally don't like. And the feel is a bit thin on the liquid. Carbonation is kind of low too.

Has a distinct bitterness that is strong, but in a very pleasant way - probably offset by the sweetness.

Decent lacing throughout. Smell was very full, lots of oak, and bourbon aromas, and the vanilla is unmistakable, in fact pretty much over powering. First impression was not pleasant, it was vanilla overload for me, nad what the vanilla didn't kill the oak took care of later. Not enough carbonation left it feeling utterly flat and uneventful. Really had a rough time getting all of this down as the vanilla and oak were just overdone and killing it for me. Overall nah, I am good.

Pours very dark brown with a thin little head which is more of a thin little ring of bubbles than anything. Kind of unexciting-looking, esp. considering the name. Odor is strongly of chocolate with hints of vanilla and bourbon. Also some toasty notes. The vanilla odor worries me and for the first time i notice that this is aged with vanilla beans. Taste is heavy on the vanilla up front, with a transition to a toasty roated malt and chocolate. Alcohol is present in a slumbering bourbon quality and the vanilla is a beany ice-cream vanilla rather than a a fake "vanilla flavoring" one. Still, like a lot of vanilla-tinged beers, its very freaking distracting and i wish it wasn't there so i could just concentrate on the "bourbon" and "stout" parts of the beer. Also a little watery for the style, but well balanced. Not my favorite beer in the world, but im sure its better on tap. Thanks Paul.","aforbes10","May 23, 2007"

I live in Washington, DC and visit the brewery once every 2-3 months for sixtels and pony kegs. Their beers are good, not great, and the customer service at their brewpup is subpar (most of the waitstaff is clueless, and the bartenders appear to be idiots), but I like what they do, so I keep going back. The Oak Barrel Stout pours a deep rich reddish black with a thin head. Not much foam or lace to speak of. But the aroma is what captures you. Strong vanilla scent, with some chocolate, some caramel, and a woody overtone. The taste is just as nice, with the vanilla present again, as well as some bitter coffee, and a hint of citrus in the finish, which is unusual for a stout of this nature, but present nonetheless. Mouthfeel is a bit weak. Overall, I like the Oak Barrel, mostly because it presents a formidable opponent to some lesser stouts out there. The problem is that you can't find it everywhere. So you're stuck drinking inferior stouts until Old Dominion can get distribution wider-spread.","Atlas1","Dec 10, 2006"

The taste is fairly dry throughout, but has a very strong caramel/vanilla presence, which is more potent than the traditional stout flavors, which hide in the background.

3.97,1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Received in a recent trade from BA nriech, bottled on July 19 2006. Pours a deeply dark chocolate brown, almost black, with a rather thin light mocha head. Roasty black malt aromas mix with a faint vanilla sweetness. Some coffee undertones and a bit of earthy hops appear as well, but overall the nose is surprisingly restrained, since this is served at just about cellar temperature and no colder. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. Meaning: It's not overpoweringly vanilla-scented, but I'm not all that excited by the nose either. Okay, the taste helps me decide: the nose is good. Regarding the flavor, the vanilla sweetness and the roasted malt characteristics mentioned above really come forward in the taste, but not too forcefully in either respect. They are quite well balanced, in fact. A dry oakiness is also present in the taste, lingering for a while afterwards, lending a vinous aspect to the finish. Slight carbonation, a bit slippery in the mouthfeel, leaning towards a velvet smoothness. Medium body. Not the dryest stout in the world. I like mine to be pretty heavy on the roasty side of things, and the vanilla beans prevent that from really taking over in this beer. But it's got a very compelling flavor profile nevertheless. I'd like to try this on tap someday as I get the feeling it might be a little more exciting that way. Easily sessionable, as long as you don't mind a slight, persistent vanilla flavor in stouts.","orfeu","Oct 15, 2006"

4.29,9.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability & Notes: Although the bourbon aftertaste makes you think it have a higher abv level, it doesn't. No more or less drinkable than most stouts I've had. And yet it is a great light stout. The bourbon and vanilla are at a perfect level (not at all overwhelming, but supplement the other stout flavours well). Great smell with some unique linguiring flavours.","jslot38","Apr 11, 2006"
3.9,-0.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Interesting brew in that it has the complex mix of flavors of a "big" beer... but isnt. Pours with a syrupy smell of vanilla and a bit of maple. When in the glass, theres a brown spongy head over a ruby to black body. Taste is of a dry stout, but well mellowed with a trace of smoke and coffee. Vanilla is in just the right proportion to be a "part" of the beer instead of making it a "flavored" beer, if you get my meaning. Very light oakiness helps smooth out the brew, too.","DrunkMcDermott","Mar 30, 2006"
4.28,8.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"12 oz., bottled on 2/9/06 - fermented with vanilla beans and oak chips. I served this one in a chalice. It pours black with dark brown tinges on the edges and a thin espresso head of medium bubbles, leaving some spots of lace. It smells very roasted, with tobacco juice, chocolate, lots of floral/spicy, almost citric hops, and a big vanilla profile that mixes well into the bouquet. There are flavors of oak and vanilla right away with chocolate, roasted malts, tobacco, charred wood?, and some dark fruit notes. Delicious. It has a medium to thick body that leaves a long finish and drinks very easily. A damn fine stout.","mmmbeer","Mar 28, 2006"

Taking a whiff of the beer was like waking up after camping to the smell of rain-soaked charred oak campfire logs--it was a subdued smokey-oaky scent. It was heavenly. In comparison, the flavor and mouthfeel were thin and a bit of a let-down. I could taste the classic stout malts that resemble the acidic bitterness in coffee, but there was not much more there.

Aromas of wood, alcohol, vanilla, and roasted sugar seemed to come out very nicely. The taste was just an explosion of sweetness with a roasted/smoky character upfront and a honey & vanilla finish. The flavors of this beer on-tap are much more prominent and aggressive than in the bottled verison which is much much more subtle and gentle. The dominating flavors work very well together and generate a lingering sweetness that feels more like root beer or an ice cream float than a stout. I felt my tongue coated after every sip with an almost bready/chewy texture. So rich and so smooth I could have this all day, though eventually the sweetness might rot my teeth.","jaluria","Feb 06, 2006"

The taste was much much more even and even a little milk stout-ish, a nice roasty flavor that gives way to a oaky (read slight tannin) and vanilla flavor with a bit of lactic sweetness.

Sweet initially, with black coffee notes leading to a rich maltiness and a mildly bitter finish. The notes of bourbon are ever so slight, but are noticeable. I'd have given this a little more time to sit in those wooden barrels. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth with not too many bubbles, just a little carbonation. Nice.

Dominion's Oak Barrel Stout has a truly complex and thick taste, combining the taste of malt with hints of vanilla, coffee and chocolate overlayed with the complexity of oak.

4.62,17.6,3.5,4,5,4.5,5,"From draft, its near perfect. It has extreme vanilla on the first nose. Inhaling deeper you get a very woody scent straight from the oak barrels it came from. It's so deep brown its near black. Caramely(maybe not a real word) head. Rich in color as in smell. Taste is like pure heaven. It is a real vanilla stout with bourbon hanging on everytaste bud with out killing the vanilla. The vanilla despite its strength, is not over powering as well. Leaving a very smooth stout. So enjoyable you can have it for breakfast of dessert. This is a beer you must seek while in Virginia. You might not be a stout person but it is something you will remember always. That's how important this stout is to me. I remember when Jason and Todd both privileged to have it on draft, had their first taste. It was like watching a kid try something sweet for the first time in their life. It truly is an amazing beer. It is one of the first beers that made me understand why beer is so great.

Poured a drak murky burgundy under a purplish beige 1.5 finger head that settles fairly slowly, leaving nice lace rings. There's a good roasty nose with vanilla and chocolate notes. The mouth is quite prickly, yet syrupy thick. We've got marvellously smooth nut and chocolate flavors, with sweet caramel. The ever so slight hops presence breaks through the malt only late in the finish. Slightly dry aftertaste, but the lasting impression is mostly sweet. Recommend this as a very nice nightcap.","Globetrotter","Nov 21, 2004"

4.23,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer came to me in traditional pint glass, on the warm side; color was pitch black in the center and became more brown/black towards the edges and cocoa brown on the very edge, no light passed through. There was light to barley any carbonation noticeable. The head that was formed was creamy, thick and sticky but fell fairly fast to a light skim and a ring on the edges, the color was a medium cocoa powder brown, with some highlights and dark points across the surface. There was some sticky lace throughout the glass, more prominent in the beginning then towards the end. Typical stout characteristics. The aromas that came from the glass were of caramels, vanilla bean, some cocoa powder oak wood, toffee, some dark malts, a light coffee at times, and bourbon notes throughout, vanilla and bourbon seemed to become alittle more pronounced as it warmed and near the last sip. The tastes were more complex then the aromas. Tastes of roasted malts, and oak were the first flavors that hit my buds along with a slight bitter coffee, then some sweet malts, vanilla bean, caramel, toffee, chocolates, more oak wood, and warming notes of bourbon dominated the rest of the taste, and ended more with a pronounced bourbon flavor and the other flavors seemed step to the rear, especially as it warmed. Aftertaste was on the roasted malt, alcohol side but not real lasting. Body was on the full side especially as it warmed. Decently complex seemed to became more complex as it sat. A good beer and nice and warming. One of the better beers that is being done with oak barrels, barrel aging, etc. I have this beer in 12oz. bottle and look forward to comparing it with the nitro version.","Jarod","Nov 07, 2004"

The nose is stout-like as would be expected, and the vanilla and oak do lend a subtle note to it. I also like the fact that it's not a bourbon-barrel stout - not that they're not great, but this is different. And that's where it really shines. The vanilla clearly comes through in the flavor, but it's not overly done, and more woody notes appear in the finish. Very nicely balanced, and interesting.

Spicy vanilla, earthy, woody and oaky. Bitter vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg and even cookie dough are all detectable in this beer. The taste is rich and roasty, very creamy and mellow, bready and very flavorful. Wonderfully complex that finishes bitter and dark.

3.93,0,4.5,4,4,3,4,"The beer pours jet black with a 3 finger latte colored head that sticks around well after the pour. The nose is just full of different smells. I get less of the chocolate and coffee tones that I am used to in a stout, and more vanilla and bourbon tones. As the beer warms, more of the malty goodness comes through in the form of a mocha aroma. The flavor is fairly good, but a little weaker that I would like. There is mostly coffee and vanilla coming through this one, with hints of the oak staying in the background and more prevalent after swallowing the beer. Still a good offering. The beer falters a bit in the mouthfeel. Its just not thick enough and there is more carbonation that I like to see. This is a highly drinkable stout. Its not overly filling and could easily be a session beer in the cold of winter with a hearty stew or thick soup.","kmpitz2","Aug 29, 2004"

4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Black, every shade of black, in other words it is dark. There was no light penetration at any point. The head color was brunette and about a half finger in height. Head retention was fair; it faded a little too quickly to a fizzy cap that thinned out from there. There wasnt much subsequent lacing, just a few spots of foam that tried in vein to cling to the glass. Still, this is a very good-looking beer. The first whiff of the nose was all vanilla; I was quite taken aback! It was a little much for me. However, the second sniff allowed for some roasty qualities to penetrate. At the back were a suggestion of wood and some hints of chocolate-milk with espresso. The potency isnt that great but it is plenty strong enough to get the point across. I like the bouquet, after the first smell it became very well rounded. Lovely actually, inviting. The palate is every bit as pleasant as the nose lead on, and that is all I can ask for. The roasty qualities are the focal point, as expected for a stout. Flavors included coffee beans, fresh espresso with a dash of milk and a side of dark chocolate. Tasty. The vanilla is at home in the middle and lingers to the finish were it is teamed up with a distant note of wood. By the aftertaste the roast has reestablished itself. The astringency works perfectly with a sharp hops bite. This is a very good stout, the layers of flavors is a real treat. I love the fact the abv is just above 5%, Id be happy to session with this any day. The palate has no flaws but no one striking aspect that really elevates this beer. Dont misunderstand this statement, as this is a kick-ass stout. Medium/medium-light in body, the carbonation is rather lively which kind of tricks my tongue into thinking this is a bigger beer than it is. I do think a maltier backbone would really help this beer as the mouthfeel, while pleasant, is a bit thin. I found this stout to be very drinkable and very likable. If I ever see this beer again I will by at least a six-pack. This beer is a treat to drink. Thanks meathookjones for the 12-ounces of yummy beer!","bditty187","Aug 17, 2004"

Dark roasted grains, coffee, cocoa and vanilla, maybe some tobacco and cream soda notes, too. Some vinous and woody characteristics in the aroma, but mostly confectioner-like aromas. Tastes rather thin for a stout. Rich vanilla accents throughout the whole experience, with weak black patent and chocolate malt tastes backed with a little bit of hops (Challenger?). Medium to low carbonation. The flavors do meld nicely, but if I were king of the world, I'd boost the grain bill up a notch and balance out the aggressiveness of the vanilla a little better.

The smell was awesome! It had abunch of things going on at once. First had a smell of butterscotch, then was vanilla, then malty with a tinge of alcohol. The taste was similar, but was more on the butterscotch/vanilla malt taste, with a slight hint of the hops. The drinkability on this one is way over a 5.

Tasted great, lots of roasty vanilla-coffee flavour and a bit of a lactic presence, which isn't my favorite taste but it works in the right blend, and this is quite a good blend, so it works. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but with all the flavour it doesn't take too much away. Drinkability is good, but because it smells so alcoholic I think it might get to me after a while.

Palate is a bit less interesting, but still delicate, smooth and satisfying, which is no surprise from Dominion. Medium body and carbonation enhance the high drinkability.

From what I can tell recipe has changed and AB owns the Old Dominion breweing company even though it had been a Virginia staple during my formative beer years. Pours a pitch black with a nice full volcanic eruption mocha tan head forming thick and dwindling slow with fine lace. Nose is a bit dull, but I can detect dark chocolate with hints of sourdough bread and a touch of vanilla oak chip accent. Flavor wise it's creamy dark chocolate, hints of oak chips and vanilla bean flavors. Subdued flavors much less roasted malt than when I first tried this beer in the early 2000s. Their sampler used to be hands down one of the best that came to the Burgh, the Dominion Ale had layers of complexity and the Dominion Lager was the best export style I had ever tasted aka Dortmunder. Topped off with the Oak Barrel and Dominion Pale Ale. A bit thinner than it used to be but at least it's got a some balls with even carbonation going on. Enough about memory lane this beer is promising I hope to see a sampler if the lager is as tastless as it was in VA beach last summer no thanks. Either way you cut it this brewery is no longer at the orginial locatoin where the epic brewfest used to take place each year, sad really. I'm glad this beer is still drinkable, but it's just not the same formula/method they were brewing before.

4.38,11.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep dark ruby color-not quite totally opaque.good sized tan head tha receedes to about 1/8".Roasted aroma-slight hints of vanilla.Big flavor of chocolate.Roasted malts.The vanilla is very slight-almost an after taste.I dont get any oak.There is a slight "whiskey" flavor in the backround.Nice smooth mouthfeel-goes down very easy.A great beer overall-could consume this all night.My only complaint about this and other beers of this type like the Sam Chocolate Bock is I find I am biased to look for what I see on the label in the way of flavors.Well worth seeking out and trying however.","lackenhauser","Apr 25, 2004"

4.33,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"From the 12oz bottle, courtesy of TinusTime's efforts at his store. Poured out pretty much straight black, with some slight ruby highlights. A large tan head sits atop my brew. Vanilla in the aroma, along with roasted coffee and floral hops. Incredibly smooth taste. This beer is full of taste, yet nearly floats across the tongue. Vanilla is definitely there, roasted malts, slight fruity overtones, cream, and a decent hop bitterness to finish things off. This is pretty much a vanilla version of the Dominion Stout, which is good in itself. Mouthfeel is perfect, like a light fluff across your mouth. Great brew, well balanced...with nothing overboard, so don't expect it. Just an excellent stout.","avylover","Apr 22, 2004"
4.3,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is excellent. The dry finish and average alcohol content make for an quaffable, but nice to savor, brew.","resirob","Apr 14, 2004"

4.2,6.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"So this is NOT the same beer as draught version. The kegs are full of this stout that has been aged in bourbon bottles; the bottles are the brew "dry hopped" with vanilla beans and toasted oak chips. A decent attempt at approximating barrel aging in a quicker and cheaper way, but its clearly not the same. Regardless, this is a fine stout, much better than most normal stouts and surprisingly big and dynamic, tasting to me somewhat like Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. So its a great beer but I can only imagine how much better is the draught product.","nomad","Apr 03, 2004"
4.35,10.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Edit Addendum: I let another bottle sit out for a while and assume room temperature, so I could bring out the aromatics. One of these buggers served at 55-65F has a metallic tang to the aroma that isn't noticable when the beer is chilled. And there is a pronounced nutty aftertaste present in the room-temperature beer.","Afterburner","Mar 29, 2004"
4.18,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a very fine beer. While I have difficulty treating it like a pure stout (it tastes more like an imperial stout, and given the aging process it would be better classified as a hybrid), I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something quite unique.","JimsArcade","Mar 28, 2004"

4.28,8.9,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a jet black color with two fingers of dark tan foam. There is lots and lots of lace rings left down the sides of the glass. The smell is full of roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of oak. The taste is full of mocha, burnt malt, and molasses. A hint of hops on the finish. The body is a little watery, yet very smooth. The drinkability is fantastic. An awesome stout!","SheepNutz","Mar 09, 2004"
4.55,15.8,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Mmmmm. Now this is what a stout is all about. It was dark, malty, slightly hoppy, and pretty filling. The light in Old Dominion's Ashburn, VA, brewpub was fairly dim, but Oak Barrel looked black as night in my glass. I didn't detect the bourbon flavor, just a rich, creamy stout that made my barbecue sandwich quiver in fear, knowing that it didn't have the body and texture to stand up to such a wonderful concoction. Regrettably, since the tab was on my girlfriend's father, I didn't want to order another beer until he did, and he didn't, so I only got one taste of this divine liquid.","AndIWantYou","Mar 07, 2004"
4.35,10.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep black with just hints of chestnut brown. Nice inch high head that did settle quickly into just a patch of khaki on top. Aromas of Chocolate, butter, vanilla and caramel. Taste was nice very chocolatey. For a moment I thought the bartender had poured me a Rogue Chocolate Stout. Hints of the Bourbon barrell finally seep in at the finish. Drinks smooth as silk with nice light carbonation leaving the tongue feeling clean and not heavy. A very very drinkable stout although I was a bit surprised by the amount of chocolate flavour in the stout.","TinusTime","Mar 02, 2004"

2.33,-40.7,4,3.5,1.5,3.5,1.5,"The bartender said it had a hint of vanilla. It looked like a good beer. Nice color and head. BUT this was an overpowering flavor of vanilla. The tap handle said oak barrel stout, but it should have read vanilla flavored beer. Not good. I guess it would be appealing to women and those who love the vanilla, but when you put a beer to your lips and expect to taste beer and get this...Well lets just say I was not impressed. I wouldn't order this again.","Hex92","Feb 15, 2004"

4.85,23.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This brew pours ever so slowly from the tap but when it finally reaches you it is blacker than night with a nice creamy brown head that lightly laces the glass. The oak barrels that this stuff is aged in lend a big vanilla quality to the nose with some more subtle burnt malt and sweeter chocolate characterisitics in the background. The brew opens up on the tongue with strong vanilla flavors before it is highjacked by the strong burnt malt presence and its wonderful bitter qualities. The bitter is then joined by a smoothly sweet chocolate quality that complements and balances the bitterness nicely as it fades out. The chocolate sweetness fades out into a nice smooth vanilla finish that lingers pleasantly on the tongue. This has to be one of the smoothest, silkiest beers that I've ever had, an amazing mouthfeel to accompany the heavyish body of the brew. This is a truly awesome brew that is certainly one of my favorite stouts, if only I lived a little closer to the brewpub.","Murph","Feb 27, 2003"
4.92,25.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"A growler obtained 11/27/02. A big creamy head floating on this beautiful black as the nite without any stars in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean (I remember of nites like that from days in the Navy) brew. The aroma is something that it is hard to describe. It has this fragrance of vanilla and bourbon. The smoothness and balance of this brew is remarkable. There is sweet softness of the malt embracing the palate and the slight presence of hops at the finish. It has to be one of the most distinctive, drinkable stouts that I have ever had.","rotsaruch","Nov 30, 2002"
4.77,21.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"On tap at the brewpub. Virtually black in hue w/ a thick, dense, creamy beige head that leaves intricate lace. Roasted barley coffee notes, dark caramel and milk chocolate in aroma, w/ a touch of diacetyl butterscotch. Hugely oaky vanilla flavor from the barrel conditioning accompanied by a perfectly smooth chocolate malt, carob and dark crystal malt combination. Superlative balance of rich malt flavors and hop bitterness. It's hearty, full bodied, yet isn't overly rich. Oak Barrel Stout (formerly known as Bourbon Stout) finishes w/ a light sweetness and satisfying lingering roastiness. Absolutely outstanding and truly unique.","marc77","Jul 22, 2002"
5,27.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Of all the stouts except Imperial Stouts I like this one best. Creamy and malty full of wonderfull bourbon aromas this stout is not as dry as a typical Irish Stout.
