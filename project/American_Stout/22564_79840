The taste starts sweet and heavy, with the spices coming on then finishing very spicy with some heat. Almost like a chili pepper beer. It has a heavy thick mouthfeel, smooth, with very little carbonation. Overall a drinkable beer but the spicy finish deters me from liking it.","wingman14","Mar 30, 2015"

Strong initial coffee & chocolate taste finishes in a smooth yummy tingle on the back of the tongue, with just a hint of pepper taste itself.

Aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg with a whole lot of chocolate and some light earth and roast to round us out. The flavor is spices up front with chocolate coming in next, nutmeg pops out again before the spicy heat settles into the back of the throat and just lingers there. Medium body with a light level of carbonation. That is a tasty beer. could use a hint more carbonation, but I still enjoyed the hell out of it .","johnnnniee","Jan 11, 2015"

Great chocolate and spice flavors with a perfect amount, for me, of Habanero on the back end. Very interesting drink that grows on you. Only negative, as others have noted, is the watery mouthfeel.  Maybe not a go to beer that you always have on hand but certainly one to try and to savor on occasion.","Wolvmar","Nov 29, 2014"

It seems this has improved since then, however it could still bear a bit more (5%) base malt and a bit less (5%) roasted malt. As it stands, however, this is a very unique beer in which you can really taste all the ingredients and they are all in balance with each other.

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and cinnamon aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, cinnamon, and pepper flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with nice cocoa and cinnamon qualities all around.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 17, 2014"

Huge fudgy coffee aroma with hints of cinnamon and spice. This smells awesome. Flavor follows with rich fudge, earthy espresso, and just a small bit of zest from the peppers and cinnamon. Lingering spicy coffe chocolate cinnamon flavor left on the palate with a small bit of heat left in the throat. Medium plus body with medium carbonation and very smooth. I have had both Bomb and Pirate Bomb and find this to be better than both of those, with more pepper kick than Hunahpu. Awesome and underrated brew!","BMMillsy","Oct 27, 2013"

4.11,5.7,4,4.25,4.25,3.5,4,"Overall I thought this was very nice beer and very nice example of the style, all the aspects seem to work pretty well with each other and they make for one flavorful and unique stout. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the taste did a great job at holding my attention but I think the warming heat would start to wear on me after a couple so that would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was how well all the different aspects in this beer worked together in the flavor and aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I thought it was a little too thin. I would for sure buy this beer again, and I wouldn't mind keeping some in the fridge for when I'm in the mood for a beer a like this. I would recommend this to anyone who likes coffee beers and doesn't mind some spice to go along with it, I pretty much recommend it to all my friends. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I thought it was a little different then the draft version since the nutmeg and cinnamon seemed a little toned done, but other than that it was pretty much just how it remember. It would put it up there with citra and bean flicker as my favorite bottled beers by them so far, good job Odd side Ales, keep up the good work and interestingly unique beers.","StoutHunter","Oct 04, 2013"
3.34,-14.1,4,3.75,3,3.5,3.25,"O: If you're going to put mocha in the name of your beer, you need to have coffee and CHOCOLATE. Having chocolate in this beer would improve it by leaps and bounds, as it would compliment the coffee and pepper very well and keep the spices from being too cloying. Hopefully we will see another version of this from Oddside with chocolate. That would be a great beer.","CMUbrew","Oct 03, 2013"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, cinnamon, nuttiness, cream, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt with coffee and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream, light pepper, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream, light pepper, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with coffee and spices; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Some light pepper heat builds up on the finish near the end of the glass, but it is pleasant. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice spiced stout! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, coffee, and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 29, 2013"
