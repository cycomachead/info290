4.1,16.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: It’s dark and thick with a light tan head. The slowly fades out leaving just a ring of foam at the edge of the glass. Lacing is mostly slick. Smell: The aroma has a light toasted grain character with hints of almond like nutty notes and cherries. Taste / Palate: The flavor has a tart cherry roasted maltiness up front. As it warms I get more roasted coffee like malt notes. The finish has a mix of light tartness and bitterness. Carbonation and palate feel right on.","generallee","Mar 31, 2015"

The mouthfeel dries out too fast and there isn't enough body to sustain it in the cellar. The cherries should have stayed on the trees or gone into some nice preserves or something. Keep your cherries out of my beer please. Skip this one in the future and pay the extra money for the Bell's Expedition Stout; totally worth it.","ClavisAurea","Mar 26, 2015"

The tart cherries hit you in the taste with dark chocolate, reminiscent of of a holiday boxed dark chocolate with sour cherry filling.

An interesting and unique appearance, despite the lack of lacing or head retention. The scent is that of a silky porter, with chocolate malts and light roast. There's a sour cherry aroma hiding in the background. The first sip is surprising to say the least. The slight chocolate malt sweetness is absolutely crushed by  a shockingly sour flavor. A lemon-like puckering tartness  and vague cherry gives way to an ashy finish. The body and carbonation are thin, with little intrigue. Wow, pretty much a train wreck! It was as if someone poured lemon juice in to a nondescript porter, then emptied their ashtray in to it. If I didn't know better, I'd think this one was spoiled. Judging by the bottle date (11/6/14) and the other comments, this is the intended product. I nearly relegated this to drain pour status, but a part of me was really rooting for Bells, so I gave it the old college try. I must admit, I am not particularly fond of sours. After it reached room temp, it was considerably easier to drink. The underlying flavors of the stout became more discernible and attempted to keep the sour notes in balance. Attempt is the key word. Either way, this is one sour beer, and the flavor profile just doesn't add up. Ashy, tobacco smoke and citric sour cherry tartness are just an odd combination. Quite frankly, it just doesn't work.","JohnnyI","Jan 16, 2015"

Personally I wouldn't order it at a bar at full price and I wouldn't buy it but as a special at the bar and considering it is 7% it's not bad to have one and switch it up.","The_Beer_Connoisseur","Dec 05, 2014"

The harsh prickliness is offputting, and there’s just not enough else there to overcome its flaws. If you want cherry, find yourself some New Glarus or a good sour ale.","MaximalC","Dec 02, 2014"

I thought it was a brilliant fusion of tart cherries and rich earthy stout. the fruit is maybe a little medicinal in the nose of this dark chocolate colored forthy tan headed wonder. sharp sting from the cherry and the alcohol is maybe a little much on the nose, but I think its pleasantly mellowed by the charred dark barley character and a hint of sweet cocoa. the flavor is better balanced I think than the nose, but equally dynamic. it is a stout first, lots of nice deep dark grain properties and a perplexing smoothness, while the cherries come on later. they marry well into the dark grain, a definitely chocolate covered cherry thing going on here, like those little ones soaked in booze you eat at holiday time. dark authentic fruit with enough tartness to almost trick me into tasting wild ale yeast or bacteria. its not though, its just piquant enough too, and clean in the finish for the style, not the least bit sweet. I like its complexity and its drinkability. it feels perfect with snow and chirstmas coming on, and like all bells beer, its expertly made. I would definitely buy this if it were available in Colorado.","StonedTrippin","Nov 27, 2014"

It's nose is it's best feature, a malty sweetness with presence of coffee and cherries. It tastes like a nice stout with some great malt accompanied by coffee which introduces some bitterness. The second half of it's flavour quickly turns into a sickly sweet experience before the tart cherries finish it off. This is the part which leaves me conflicted. The stout by itself would be great, the middle is very off-putting and the cherries at the end just don't seem to belong. In the end the mixture of sweet, alcohol and tart is reminiscent of cough syrup. I have a second bottle and hope to revisit this after a better experience.","byronic","Oct 29, 2014"

Smell is classic Export Stout - roasted malt, chocolate and faint coffee - no cherries in the aroma for me (???). The flavor saves this one for me - a ton of fresh tart cherries up front, followed by roasted malt, chocolate, mild sweetness, and espresso. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and extremely creamy, finishing just a bit dry and somewhat chalky. Overall very enjoyable and tasty Cherry stout that is well balanced and definitely left me wanting to drink another. A great beer for the Fall season upon us.","DeanMoriarty","Oct 29, 2014"

It's nowhere near being a cherry bomb, but the cherry notes really do add something special to this beer. As a stout it's got good roast also.

This beers starts out all stout then finishes almost all cherry syrup. Occasionally you'll get the stout mixed with cherry tartness - which is excellent. Good, but not great.

Full bitter stout riding over chocolate covered cherries with some more Merlot. Lots of sour. It's real hard to make a consistent beer flavor with something this sour-- but they pull it off.

The breweries from Michigan I love call the cold months 'stout season' and its hard to argue Bell's don't release a load of great, drinkable stouts for winter. I enjoy cherry stout and its almost a tradition for my friends and family to have one every winter. It's like an American stout meets sour ale with them walking hand in hand down your palate with the cherries only being there for flavor and not to just pucker you up. Cherry Stout holds a place in my heart and a place in Bell's winter lineup and I hope it remains there. One of the best fruit stouts ever made.","BradtheGreat7","Jan 08, 2014"

Missed getting this beer two years ago and last year they didn't brew it due to a cherry shortage. Did have the barrel aged version and have to say that is far superior, the barrel adds the vanilla and sugars this beer needs.","PaulyB83","Nov 28, 2013"

3.9,10.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/8/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, tart cherry, cherry skin, light char, toast, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt with a fair amount of cherry presence; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, light char, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of cherry tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with prominent cherry flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice fruited stout style. All around good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cherry flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 01, 2013"

The roast malts are overpowered by the cherry. The crisp finish has a touch of sweetness, but again, the cherry predominates and lingers as the only aftertaste. As it warms, a better balance is achieved and roast becomes evident. I began this review at 33 degrees F. Another fine stout from Bell's.","tillmac62","Oct 27, 2013"

3.14,-10.8,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Bottle from Sahara Mart bloomington, in. Pours pitch black with about a 1 finger reddish-brown head. Aroma has stout characteristics: chocolate, roasted malt and a hint of cherry. Taste has none of the chocolate and all of the cherry. The slight carbonation gives a smooth sweet texture. If you like very tart stouts then this beer is for you. But other than that it is not balanced well and is too tart for a sweet stout. If the other ingredients could come through this would be an above average beer but just settles for average.","dmb2890","0"

I've heard some people describe this as tasting like chocolate covered cherries, and I can certainly see that correlation (as long as you remember it IS a beer hiding in there).

The aroma is a unique blend of tart cherries and chocolatey malt. Pleasant and enticing with a lemony hint. The flavor brings a more challenging blend of bitter cherries with charcoal malt, with very little chocolate. Bitterness really takes over here but the malt base remains and carries a modest herbal hop. Tasty but takes some taste bud adjustments. Medium bodied with a pretty cohesive feel that includes a bit of chalkiness. Carbonation is very subtle but a bit prickly. You do get use to this and I would say it’s a neat, unique stout worth trying.","Durge","Beers"

3.85,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brownish color with the slightest pink tinge to an otherwise khaki colored head. Aroma of sweet cherries and roasted malts. In the flavor, a blend of roasted malt notes mimicking coffee, cocoa and mild astringent bitterness, paired with tart cherry flavor. Interesting how tart the cherries have become (this beer was aged 5 months). Tart, sour, roasty, mildly bitter and quite tasty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Overall, a pretty nice stout, with tart cherry flavor. Solid.","Stinkypuss","Mar 13, 2012"

More cherries came out as it warmed up, which I let happen to get that aspect of the beer but I actually preferred the more subtle cherry flavor when it was cold. Before the cherry started dominating, I got some chocolate and more heavy malt but a decent amount of bitterness. Now that the cherries are kicking me in the teeth that's really all I'm pulling out of this one.

It falls somewhere in the nether-realm of a tart sour, a sweet fruit beer and a export stout but never commits to any of them, to the beers detriment…on my palate at least.

The smell of the beer is sweet, roasted and has a tart cherry aroma coming off of it. I was hoping for more of a sweet cherry but either way you can tell there will be some cherry in there. The flavor if the beer is just a little off in my opinion. I was thinking that this would have gone better together but I felt the cherry was just a little too tart for me. The mouthfeel was a bit on the light side also which hindered my thoughts on this beer too. Overall this brew was fun to try but I haven't really got much desire to have it again.","Knapp85","Oct 26, 2011"
3.65,3.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,3,"O: It isn't all that drinkable. The sweetness, while headed off by the tart cherries and roastiness, is undeniable and sort of takes over after a while. Strange aftertaste.","russwbeck","Oct 25, 2011"

Strong aroma of booze, slight cherry, earth, medicinal notes and raisins, dark chocolate and sharp cinnamon. Whoa! Chocolate, tangy and sour fruit, cherry purée, booze, and rides sharp tang to the finish. Heavy in body and light in carbonation. The cherries are a bit strong here and personally would like it more as an accent in the drink rather than being at the forefront.","JRed","Oct 10, 2011"
3.61,2.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that maintains good retention and decent lacing. The nose has a strong cherry aroma with some chocolate and sweet malts in the back. The taste is similar to the smell in which the cherries over takes everything. The cherry taste stays through out and in the aftertaste. I do get some chocolate, coffee, sweet malts and a hint of hops in the back. Everything is well balanced, but the cherries was a bit too much. I think it would have been better with a little less cherries in this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and easy drinking and if you like a strong cherry taste in your stout than this is the beer for you.","DannyDan","Oct 05, 2011"
3.3,-6.3,4,4,3,3,3,"O- I'm all for adding fruit to a stout but it would be nice to pick up more on the malts without all the sour cherry taking over. I love a good sour beer, but not when i'm expecting a nice rich, deep, complex, roasty, and malty stout.","Flux","Oct 05, 2011"
3.82,8.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall a great beer given it incorporates fruit but I'm not sure how it works singularly as a stout.

2.97,-15.6,4.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Received this as an extra in a trade. Poured with a nearly nonexistent head despite a fairly vigorous pour. The nose starts off with a faint cherry scent. Fast forward to the taste, and it's all cherry all the time. Big, bold, sour cherry. This is like...a sour stout. Mouthfeel is very tart. This one's hard to retain. Intake, swallow, repeat. The longer it's in your mouth, the more twisted and contorted your face is sure to become. Overall, this is average at best. Wouldn't make an effort to revisit, and might not drink if it was the only beer option. Interesting nonetheless, and glad I got to try it.","Retail1LO","Aug 15, 2011"
3.48,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: This is definitely the tartest stout I've ever had. It's a unique brew that one could order to mix things up later in a drinking session. I generally like rounder, roastier, maltier/sweeter stouts, but this one was an enjoyable change.","mdvatab","Aug 13, 2011"

However, I was lucky enough to taste after a late summer meal of fresh vegatables and only IPAs to influence my palate. I taste and imagine this brew and it's ingrediants all mellowed from time stored in american oak barrels. A beer perfectly suited for a last of the night choice, esp in the context of slow and relective evaluation of events of the day...and this brew.

3.3,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I don't like this beer as much as I expected to. I guess cherry juice + roasted malts = too much acid.

Not an awful beer, but I won't be seeking it out again.","lisomiso","Aug 08, 2011"
2.87,-18.5,3.5,4,2,4,2.5,"Overall: I put this akin to my first experience with Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. It's all tobacco and burnt.

3.06,-13.1,4,3,3,3,3,"O - Interesting brew. If I look at it from my wild ale/sour loving perspective, this is definitely an ok beer. I was expecting something a little more stout-ee, and didn't get that at all. It's a confused brew. Not quite sour, but not quite a stout. If you like roasted sour cherries, give it a go... I probably won't be trading for it any time soon though. Glad I got to try it!","actone2001","Jul 30, 2011"

3.47,-1.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours black and syrupy with a small dark brown head and a minimum of lace. Some sediment is present. Smell is roasty and a bit of smoke with a TON of cherry. The malty stout aroma floats in the middle. Taste is smoky roast on the front with some minimal sweetness in the middle with bittersweet sour cherry at the finish. Tartness is a bit of a shock, but grows on you quickly. Very complex. Slippery mouthfeel with not a lot of carbonation. Actually the cherry is very tart throughout. Aftertaste is sour cherry and lots of smoky bitterness. This is not your girly fruit beer. The taste is complex and smoky, and the cherry is bitterly tart. This cries out for a bold smoky ham sandwich with sharp cheddar.","jgurley","Jul 18, 2011"

4.07,15.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Drink and overall: Overall, I really enjoy this stout (on tap). This beer does not age well in a bottle, for whatever reason.

First taste has coffee, a bit of chocolate and a bit of sweet cherry, however when I swallow, I'm overwhelmed with tart cherry. Different kind of stout than what i'm used to. Mouthfeel is creamy, but a bit thin. Not much carbonation. The cherry lingers in the aftertaste. Tart, but not overly tart. I catch quite a bit of chocolate on the aftertaste as well.

3.9,10.8,4.5,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Dark black pour, with a thin gray head. Potent aroma of cherries, that yields a light cherry cough syrup taste. The cherries are prevalent enough to tell these are very likely real cherries, and pretty fresh. A bit too much malt (Black Patent) for my taste though.

3.85,9.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I used a very gentle pour as I was concerned that lees may have formed over time. I am unsure that it mattered, however, as there was very little carbonation present and even a vigorous swirl failed to produce any head. Color was an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) with only some cola highlights visible at the edges. Nose was filled with the scent of dried tart cherries, slightly medicinal, but still pleasant. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and without carbonation, as I had previously mentioned. This allowed the tartness of the cherries to really shine and I feel as though I have come a long way since my original review. I did not find it to be at all unpleasant. Instead, I liked the way the cherries had really come to the forefront, especially since I was not getting much in the way of the dark malts. Finish remained tart, but not puckering. It was an interesting experiment, to be sure, but I am coming to the realization that fresher probably would have been better. My last pour was that of the lees, agitated back into suspension. This last bit was much more tart than the rest, which is worth noting.","woodychandler","Jun 05, 2011"

3.5,-0.6,4,4,3,4,3.5,"O- I wish this was a little more roasty and had some better balance, a little too cherry forward.

Smells tasty. The taste opens with a burst of tart, mouthwatering cherry which slowly fades over a good 30 seconds--impressive if it were balanced with other stout-y flavors, but it turns out like cherry juice. I do get some cocoa on the finish, which turns out to be better than the beer itself. Carbonation is low, too low for the style. Overall, the nice aroma got my hopes up, but this beer doesn't avoid the trap common to cherry stouts of ham-handedness over subtlety.","pmarlowe","May 24, 2011"

The aroma is quite subtle and doesn't offer much of a hint to the large flavor to come- a flavor which is dominated by tart michigan cherries. The cherry flavor, which is quite authentic and doesn't resemble cough syrup or candy at all, is far and away the most dominant flavor in this brew. The flavor is more "adult" than other mass-market cherry beers, owing much to the tart cherries, but is still very cherry indeed. Although very tasty, I believe that the best use of this beer is in cooking. This is not a complaint- this would make a great component to a sweet dessert. For drinking, though, it would be tough to drink more than one, but the quality is quite evident and I would definitely recommend trying this one.","matt20102","Apr 25, 2011"

The cherry flavor is strong and tart, far from the over-sweetened brew I expected. It's roasty and malty with a nice bitter chocolate coffee finish but it's a bit too carbonated.

But the smell is surprisingly weak. The flavor is very interesting and hard to pin down whether it's good or kind of bad. I guess it depends on your mood. The positives are a sweet, chocolaty, tart cherry medley which makes this come off as a dessert beer, if there is such a thing. The downside is it can lean towards a cough syrup flavor and consistency. So, not good there. But it plays tricks on my tasting facilities: one sip is "hey this is pretty good," and the next is "no it's not my thing." A strange brew, to be sure. I'd try it rather than pass it up, if only for the experience with this rare style of beer. Overall I'd say it lacks dimension, but it may be what some people are looking for.","MNJR","Apr 14, 2011"

The dark roasted malt and molasses flavors also peek in for a bit. Sweetness is there in the aftertaste, too, and with the rich and slightly oily/slick body, this one can be overpowering.

Another great one from Bell's but one that is a single go for me.","BARFLYB","Jan 14, 2011"

When I get home, I notice under natural light that the bottles are very dusty. I check the batch number, and sure enough, it was packaged on Nov. 18th, 2009. Now, I have friends who hate this beer. They can't stand out cherry-forward it is. These year-old bottles, though, are quite balanced. Basically, I am telling you to drink this beer aged rather than fresh.

Looks right around average. The aroma is immediately filled with cherries. A bit of sweetness, like overripe ones, and a bit of tartness, like the slightly yellow and orange ones. Nice cherry aroma, but still enough of the coffee, chocolate smells to let you know that it's a stout under there. Overall, a good smell, it does what it says here. The flavor is interesting, tart, juicy, and fruity, backed up with coffee, with a taste of dark chocolate. But the dark cherry flavor dominates overall. It finishes a bit dry, I wish there was more chocolate sweetness to accent the cherry flavor, as opposed to sort of bitter astringent coffee, but it's a great blend of stout flavors and cherry flavors. The body, is medium, maybe a little heavier than that, but still lighter than I expected, maybe because of the cherries. A decent chewiness though. The carbonation is very low - I would've liked a little more, though I can see how it would be easy to have too much in a beer like this. It's a little high on the ABV scale, woudln't want more than one, though I did enjoy the one I had.

The palate opens with a tart cherry character, almost tannic with sourness quite prominent. This is followed by the chocolate and licorice that balance the sourness. Chocolate character is mostly dark choc in nature, lending a bitterness that persists on the finish with the cherry tartness carrying through as well. Carbonation is on the low side, enhancing the experience, and allowing the medium body, tart cherries and dark chocolate the come together quite well.

Modest head with a slight reddish hue that fades quickly. The payoff here is the taste. You get a blast of VERY tart cherry which forms the base of the brew! Here is what makes this beer excellent in my opinion - so many beers with fruit in the title end up having very synthetic fruit flavors (i.e., SA Cranberry Lambic and Cherry Wheat) but this one doesn't have an artificial syrup flavor. (Additionally, I am at a loss for those reviewers who can't figure out why this beer is so 'tart', especially when the bottle tells you to expect it to be so!!!). The tartness then mellows a bit and you can taste some smoky coffee notes you would expect from a stout. Mouthfeel is good - seems a little thicker than your average stout, which I like. As this one warms the tartness dies a little and gets sweeter just as you would expect. I can recall when this beer had a higher abv and was even thicker and richer (and a little better from what I can recall, honestly)...too bad it changed, but still a fabulous winter brew!!!

There is little (hardly any) carbonation here, and the mouthfeel really doesn't pack a punch at all. Drinkability is amazing - I could keep knocking these back forever.

Fairly vinous with a musty, malty base. Wowza, the cherry flavor is way more upfront than I'd anticipated and I can at first sip see this getting cloying. Pretty tart, but the sourness morphs into a kind of lactic sweetness that I quite like in a stout. Unfortunately the sweetness continues to linger as toasty oat and nut try to peak out, drowning them out for a saccharine finish. The mouthfeel is pretty good - appropriately creamy - but leaves off with a milk like film that traps the sour cherry aftertaste against the back of the throat. Almost enjoyable on a lot of counts (Bell's does make some of my favorite stouts), but the cherries could be dialed back more that a bit.

Aroma is a subtle dark chocolate and some sour cherries, a bit vinous with a chocolate flair, really nice nose. Taste is tart cherries with a bit of chocolate in the background, but the cherries command your mouths full attention. Its tart in the front, coats your entire mouth in tartness, some bitter roast makes its way through for a couple then your left with a tart cherry aftertaste. Sticky mouthfeel, low carbonation.

Out of a limited selection of Bell's beers, I chose a fruit beer. Here's why: Michigan is where sour cherries are from, Sour Cherries are one of my favorite fruits, I love a good stout , and Bell's stouts are amongst their most well regarded beers. This 12oz bottle did not disappoint. A big stout with the traditional roasted flavors, big amounts of coffee and chocolate, balanced and countered with the sourness from the cherries. Not too much sweetness, and seriously, it smells just great. Not a beer I would drink several of in a row, but it definitely lives up to its reputation and I can't wait to get into more of the Bell's.","brewdogmrb","Beers"

Nice slick mouthfeel with good consistency; smooth and silky without being viscous. Really nice brew, but drinkabiity is somewhat limited in my opinion.

Near-black in color, this brew featured a dark-tan head with good retention. Smells of dark-roasted malts and sour cherry dominate the aroma. The flavor is really heavy on tart cherry, while most of the malts and hops lurk in the background. It's difficult to get a read on the stout characteristics here, as so much of the flavor is consumed in cherry notes. It's interesting, that's for sure. Some espresso notes peek through, which somehow clash with the cherry flavor. I'm not sure if I like this or not. It's certainly drinkable, but it may be just a little too tart for my taste.

4.42,25.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Served in a Bell's tulip, chiled but not cold. Cocoa-brown in color and totally opaque when held up to direct sunlight. Topped by a one-fingered medium tan head (with hints of auburn/rust) and with good lacing evident; lacing and head stuck around quite a while. The nose is truly extraordinary, offering something for everyone. There's the expressive malt character (from the bready/yeasty to the toasty and roasted) with slight espresso notes, as well as the fruit aspect (a semi-lactic sour cherry tang) to consider here, and if anything the hops are subdued on the nose. Either way, the nose alone is worth the experience of ordering this one from the tap line up. There's a bright cherry tang on the first sip, but it is quickly subsumed by the interplay of rich malt. Complex . . . the herbaceous cherry notes return at the finish and spar with the toasty malt. The cherry really lingers here, in the way that hop bitterness typically lingers, and is very expressive in the aromatic element as well. In the past I've found this beer to 'open up' and become more flavorful after a year or more in the bottle, but not so here, this is drinking like a two year old (and well-kept) bottle! As it warms the creamy mouthfeel and medium-full body help to underscore the notes of bitter chocalate and espresso, which play out midway through the palate. Biscuity malt notes combine with light cocoa (bitter chocolate) notes, and give the body a pleasantly grainy texture, especialy as it warms. Carbonation is moderate throughout - this never feels downright 'heavy', even though it is a fairly big beer. For that matter the alcohol is never intrusive, and is gently warming. It should be noted that the ever-present cherry is of the fruity-dry quality rather than the fruity-sweet; this ain't no girly fruit beer! There's a light sweetness to the malt and a very agreeable bitterness, too. This is a marvelous rendition of a flavored stout, and with great balance being a big plus in the crafting of such a substantial brew. Outstanding.","Chaz","Mar 11, 2007"

Very roasty, fruity, and lots of chocolate basically; yummy! Tart cherries highlight the sip mostly, but a dash of alcohol kills off some of that leaving a nice shot of roasty chocolate flavors.

It pours an almost impenetrable black that reflects like an obsidian mirror, and is topped with a thin, orange/brown head that reduces to a collar and leaves light lacing. It has a luscious, almost intoxicating aroma that consists of tart cherries, roasted malts, and green/piney hops. Not too complex, yet divine. The flavor is mouth-puckeringly tart with big sour cherry overtones that mask the other flavors, which consist of coffee/roasted malts, chocolate?, raspberry, and a mild bitterness. A downside is that the tartness of the cherries makes it hard to savor the flavors and forces an almost immediate swallow. The body is medium with medium carbonation and finish, and is fairly dry due to the cherries. It is reminiscent of the "chocolate truffle" (Legend Imperial Stout + Lindeman's Framboise) I tried at a beer bar in Ghent, but overall it is too tart for a stout. The amount of cherries is sufficient for the aroma, but it's an overload on the palate. Perhaps a better addition would be some kind of sweeter fruit like blackberry or strawberry.

In fact, I would really have to say this brew reminds me of many of the sweet/milk/cream stouts that Ive tried; its got that same slightly sour sweetness to it.

Quite enjoyable, and unlike any other stout (or beer) that I've had before. The flavor is, as predicted, dotted with cherries along the way. A nice, smooth, malted stout with a quality fruit impression seems to me like it would be hard to pull off, but Bell's does so with ease here. The mouthfeel is solid and I'd call this a most drinkable beer. I'm pretty sure that I'm not always in the mood for cherry stouts, but this is definitely where I'm going when I am.

The mouthfeel is thicker than a typical draft stout, thinner than an imperial stout. Drinkability was surprisingly good.

As for the taste, if fails as all other cherry whatevers have failed... i just can't get past the cherry taste, no matter how authentic. But for the style, it pulls it off pretty well.

There also seems to be a oak character, along with a funkiness I normally associate with lambics.

Perhaps just a bit more "burnt" in flavor than I would have liked. Notes of cola and spice come through in the middle. A slow sip reveals that this is more complex than I had initially thought. The cherry flavor is intense and tart and more importantly, natural. Thank goodness it doesn't ring of an extract flavor. Mouthfeel is nice... I think the cherry seems to diminish perception of the heft of the beer. This beer is surprisingly quite drinkable, though the heavy heavy burnt notes might keep me from hitting this too hard.

Smelled faintly of chocolate , some cherries, and small amounts of coffee. Not too much going on in the nose. Tasted of cherries (seemed more present here than in the smell), sweet tart candy, and some somewhat hidden java notes ,with little carbonation and a very dry finish.

I'm not sure if the cherry tang is so sour on its own or if it's because it follows the chocofee smoke and thus only seems twice its veracious nature. But it is SOUR.

A bit of roasty malt, maybe just a hint of chocolate, and sour cherries. At first, the sourness was too much, however as I went on, I began to like the combination.

The lack of carbonation and the tart character took a bit away from the mouthfeel. This is definitely not a session beer, but one or two go down well.

I guess it's an 8% ABV beer, but you really can't tell from the taste. For the most part it's easy to drink.

The cherry adds a cloyingly sweet aftertaste that actually leaves a puckering "after-feel" in my mouth. I heard good things about this particular beer and I have to say I'm a little dissappointed. Back off on the cherry and I think they'd have a winner.","schoolcb","May 15, 2005"

The sweet cherries are also present in the nose. Taste full of roated flavor and chocolate, with plenty of cherries as well. Very much like eating chocolate cherry cake. Strange experience indeed! Although the cherry flavor is always present, it does not overpower the classic stout taste. Finish is sweet cherries mixed with bittersweet chocolate and some fruit acid. Chewy, almost oily mouthfeel - enjoyable, but not highly quaffable. A vinous character is derived from the fruit, especially noted in the acidic finish and the warming alchol that is perceived rather than tasted. A surprigingly good fruit stout, I had no idea what to expect. Definitely not a brew to start the evening with, or a session beer. Although it was good, it was like dessert, meaning the limit is one (maybe two) a night.","BeerFink","Mar 27, 2005"

Definitely lacking in the expected flavors of a stout to balance out the sour cherry flavors. Not bad but not that great either, 'specially from the makers of Two Hearted Ale and Expedition Stout.

They stay throughout, but are bolstered by a solid, roasty, chocolatey malt base. Some peat in there as well, along with notes of Bell's delicious yeast.

Absolutely pitch black...no light penetrates. Smells more of coffee and scorched caramel than cherries, but cherry is present. Immediate taste is coffee and roast grains followed quickly by a sour and cherry flavor. My first taste was more of a marchiano cherry (the preserved cherries put into mixed drinks) rather than sweet eating cherry, but a sweeter smoother cherry was present in later tastes. I also get some watermelon. The end is rough roast grain and an unpleasant sour from the cherry. It's an interesting combination, not too unlike the funk in many belgians, but one I quickly tire of. Thick mouthfeel which should be important for a stout like this, but this actually delays the acidic sting of carbonation to mix with the cherry tart and roast grains to mix too many unpleasant characteristics at one.

Medium-bodied with strong tart cherry flavor up front. Light chocolate and coffee tones present, but barely. As with the bottled, I would enjoy this more if it were balanced better.

It honestly took me a few sips to really warm up to this, but after I did, I wanted another bottle. I need to find this and stock it in my cellar.

Flavor is an interesting (odd?) mixture of things you'd expect from an imperial stout like intense and slightly bitter flavors, but the cherry tart and sweetness stomps all over the tongue and scares them away.

Aroma just as you would expect, cherry and dark malts. The name of the beer indicates the brewer's priorities here: cherry first, stout next. The taste is all about the cherries up front, and you hardly get a chance to enjoy any of the obvious dark malt/stout flavors before everything's down the hatch. Not even a heavy malt aftertaste or anything. In my mind, the cherry could be backed off a bit and the grains cranked up a notch, and things would work better for the mouthfeel, which at this point is sour with a smoothing stout slide, but none of the stout flavors that you would expect anywhere in sight.

Cherry aromas are weak, would I have even known this was a cherry stout in a blind sniff test? Probably not but the smells are inviting. Hello cherries! Yep, I tasted them on the palate. The refreshing tartness of the cherries is found up front and they try to make there way to the middle but the rush of roasted malts takes over. It is the tale of two flavors. They work great as individuals but the harmony of the two tastes combined is quite noteworthy. The sweetness of the fruit is minimal and melts gracefully with the chocolate and coffee. Surprisingly the cherries reestablish the dominant position in the aftertaste. It is very tart and very refreshing. I couldnt taste the high alcohol content, it completely bypassed my tongue, but I did feel the heat in my stomach. The mouthfeel is both good and bad, I like the fullness and the low carbonation but the dry chalkiness is unpleasant. I must admit the tart cherry flavor got a little tiresome towards the end of my glass. As a whole this is a good stout, I cant see myself ever drinking more than one of these at a time.

Finishes with a dry, roasted maltiness that is typical of a stout. Chocolate and Cherries offer a lot of promise for an excellent stout, but Bell's just hasn't got it right here, yet. Perhaps, this could use more toasted malts for a better balance. Not a bad stout, but there's a lot of room for improvement.","merlin48","Feb 10, 2004"

The cherry flavor develops and becomes more apparent as you drink more, tastes very authentically cherryish, reminiscent of the Traverse City Cherry Festival. Body is more medium than full.

Tastes: Sharp acidic tartness in the forefront, blended by dark bitter roasts not very complex a bit one dimensional with tart cherries I don't think I am a fan of this one just doesn't do it for me. Mouthfeel: Rather thin figuring the appearance of a dark liquid pouring into my glass weighing in at 8% would be packing some chewy textures and full body right, well that's not the case here a medium to light bodied brew leaves me rather unimpressed.

My memory was that the taste was a real shocker and nothing like what I was hoping for, so I thought maybe with a different frame of mind, I would like it better, but alas, no such luck. For some reason, I just kept tasting what I would say was fermented prune juice and I honestly have not tried fermenting prune juice but imagine this is kind of what it would taste like.

My lips puckered upon my first sip of this, the cherry flavor was more tart and powerful than I expected. Flavor has some very chocolatey malt notes...could probably pass for a chocolate cherry stout. The mouthfeel reflects the appearance, with some bubbly, fizzy characteristics.

Fairly bitter on the finish, with a slight sour cherry kick. Sweetness plays in and out during each sip. Earthy hops are also intermingled in. It is rather complex, but it doesn't seem like the flavors blend well. Coffee notes become more pronounced as you consume the glass. I was hoping for some nice chocolate notes to go with the cherry, but none is to be found. The mouthfeel is solid, but the carbonation is a bit light, leaning towards flat.

Yeah there's the tartness! I wouldn't say it's even close to a good kriek lambic tartness, but it's definitely strong. It provided a nice goose-bump sensation a few times. Before the straight up cherry tartness kicks in, a solid foundation of roasty stout character leaves its presence known. What an odd stout. I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. It's weird getting tartness out of a stout but I really like it.

The cherry smell is there in a deep sweet, nearly sour tone, but not over powering like a cider or lambic and has a nice heavy roasted malt aroma with some chocolate and molasses taking over in the background. Tastes tangy, quite so that the cherry is a bit much, not as balanced as it used to be, or at least from what I remember from the first time I had it. Just right for a cherry lover though, a deep sweet cherry tanged bite really pops and grabs the palate. Roasted malt with some chocolate and molasses tones are hidden way underneath the cherry. Good feel thats smooth and milky clean with a largely set cherry sour bittering kick. Not as easy to drink as I remember.

3.99,13.4,3,4,4,4.5,4,"Black and opaque. This would absorb a spot light. Brown head quickly and audibly fizzles down in a lambic like fashion into a meager ring around the glass. Bittersweet combination of burnt roasted barley and bright cherry sweetness dominates the aroma, with caramelized sweetness and milky chocolate secondary. Akin to a kriek / dry stout hybrid aromawise. Flavorwise, cherry is slightly unripe in nature, yielding a mild tartness that is the predominant counterpoint to both residual and dark caramel malt sweetness, due to the light hop bitterness. Undertone of disparate, non malt derived lactose sweetness adds depth and aids in the creamy, dextrinous mouthfeel. Clean roasted barley bitterness emerges late only to be offset by a resurgence of fruit laced sweetness. Finishes with an candyish extension of the malt profile-- not unlike chewing on an M & M, cherry Skittle and chocolate covered coffee bean simultaneously. Bell's Cherry Stout is certainly an eclectic and flavorful brew. It's complex enough to warrant a 22 ounce portion to give the palate more time to adjust and decipher.

The aftertaste is very dry with competing flavors of black malt, medicine, and sour cherry. The mouthfeel is that of a rich and silky stout. IMHO this stout taste too artificial. If whole cherries had been added to the secondary or if it was aged for a few months with real cherries then it might be a much better product. This stout has the potential to be a great stout.

I'll take the regular Bell's Stout thank you.","proc","Feb 01, 2002"
