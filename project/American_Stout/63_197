4.25,1.2,4.75,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,""Expired" (but bottle conditioned) almost three months ago, still an excellent beer. In large snifter, couldn't quite get the head to the top (unless I wanted to really overdo things, leaving the beer about only 25% liquid). Opaque dark brown to black. Frothy, lightly-creamed coffee colored head, with bubbles increasing in size as it slowly dissipates. Sticky, fast drying lace. Smells of roasted and sweet malts and chocolate, taste is somewhat similar but favors roastiness and chocolate more than sweetness, especially in the back. Like a medium roast coffee, so tangy/acidic qualities, but with a pinch of hop bitterness and spice. Seems lower than 55 IBUs, which indicates excellent balance. Thick, rich brew with perfect, prickly level of carbonation. A little oily, mostly noticeable on teeth. Warming, but not drying at all on my palate. This stout is right up there with some of the better black ales in my book.","Libeertarian","Sunday at 10:06 PM"

4.82,14.8,4.75,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Obsidian is the standard I use for stouts. Midnight black tan lacing, complex dark roasted aroma. The taste is absurdly good, with bitter dark roasted malt and dark chocolate sweetness predominant, anise, rum-soaked berries, and a healthy taste of bittering hops that do not bite. It's a bitter brew, not for those expecting Guinness or stouts of that ilk, but the bitter is elegantly balanced by a complex flavor profile. Moderate mouthfeel. Overall one of my all-time favorites in this style and in beers in general.","takusan1000","Mar 14, 2015"
4.18,-0.5,5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall: The first time I had this a few months ago I remember thinking it was thin and lacking flavor compared to what I expect from a stout. After seeing the BA rating I figured I must have been missing something, or maybe I got a bad sample. Despite the very inviting presentation and a good balance I still found it to be lacking richness and flavor.  In every other respect it is an excellent stout, and it is very drinkable - I will happily drink more of these.  The Deschutes Black Butte Porter is more exemplary of its style in my opinion.","maedhros09","Mar 14, 2015"

Deschutes are masters of the dark-roast ale, and Obsidian more than proves it.","secondtooth","Mar 07, 2015"

It left a nasty burned chocolate flavor in my mouth, wasn't a fan of it.  I'd be willing to try it on tap, but for now, it's a no go for me.","JISurfer","Jan 06, 2015"
3.19,-24,4.5,3,3.5,2.5,2.75,"Popping a bottle of Obsidian open, as with most beers, I first notice the head. It is thick but it's the color that's more notable, a kind of really light umber tone, capping the impenetrably black body. It's smooth and I noticed a relatively low amount of carbonation in my glass. The flavor is primarily roasted malts, with the usual notes of coffee and cocoa (more than a straight chocolate). As one reviewer noted, there is a bit of a char to the flavor, especially in the aftertaste. Overall, I can see this as an easy-drinking stout; it almost seems a bit too thin, but I do like its cleanliness.","plaidowl","Jan 06, 2015"

4.11,-2.1,4,4.25,4.25,3.5,4,"Poured an opaque black (with slight chocolate hue in the light). Minimal head. Bitter aromas, roasted malt, bitter coffee, some light chocolate, and a hint of molasses. Tasted of coffee, roasted malt... balanced bitterness... tasted bigger than 6%. Medium mouthfeel, perfect for a regular stout (I prefer them a little meatier). Overall outstanding. UPDATE: It is even better on nitro. All of the great flavors, etc with a mouthfeel like chocolate milk. Amazing.","Mikus","Nov 02, 2014"

It did live up to my expectations, but considering my indulgence in RISs, it's not quite robust enough. Speaking of robust, this reminds me a lot of the Smuttynose Robust Porter. Still a great regular stout, and one of my favorites in the style.","Bone53","Oct 15, 2014"

The beer smell is a sweet dark chocolate with deeply roasted malts and cocoa. The beer taste is surprisingly different from the smell. The beer taste has a much stronger hop presence with a weaker Mexican dark chocolate and cocoa taste. The hop bitterness and chocolate mix rather well. The beer is heavy bodied, creamy, and thick.

Flavor is dark roasted malt, coffee, caramel, followed by bitter hops. Mouth feel is medium full, not font or bubbly (the nitro, I guess).

4.22,0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,"Once again, a heavy-handed, aggro pour caused a pseudo-cascade as three-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head formed with excellent retention and everything went on hold until it settled. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Obsidian, indeed! As the initial head settled, I continued my pour and now it looked like a muffin top protruding from the glass. Will this head ever subside? The nose smelled like Devil's Food cake - rich, chocolaty, slightly smoky, underlain by a coffee-like odor. It smelled like a birthday cake that I had when I was really young, like 5 y/o, chocolate with purple icing. Dig that! I was obsessed with purple when I was really young and my cake played into it. Mouthfeel was big, dense and creamy and the chocolate cake was having espresso as a chaser. Phew. You had better really like those kinds of intense flavors in combination with one another and since I am the king of intensity, it was right up my alley. Beautiful lacing began to form as I drank so I sat back and watched it do its thing while taking a contemplative moment for myself. Finish was exceptionally smooth. I had drank down almost half of it without a second thought. At 6.4% ABV, this would be a great beer to get people interested in the style who may be put off by dark-colored beers.","woodychandler","Mar 12, 2014"

As far as the smell, it's certainly not bad but you definitely pick up plenty of alcohol, maybe a little coffee something along the lines of an Italian roast. The smell certainly isn't bad but would lead you to believe this beer might be harsh on the palate, but it's not. As far as the mouth-feel just perfect. Nice creamy, no serious carbonation and what is there works well. As far as taste, wow! It's all there, everything you'd expect. The first wave is some NOT so subtle barley, with some NOT so subtle malt but then some subtle dark chocolate and a slight punch of that Italian roast coffee. It all balances amazing with a relatively high alcohol content, so be careful. Just a remarkable Stout with amazing balance and exceptional "craftsmanship" or call it whatever you'd like...just very well done!","Khad","Nov 24, 2013"

But just a wee bit). Go slow with this one, it is intricate yet powerful. A sip reveals deep roasted flavors right out of the gate but there is a surprisingly clean crisp finish ... You expect this to hang there like some massive imperial and certainly the sweetness does accumulate, but there's more going on than just syrupy smoky malt. Strong acidic coffee, molasses, and dark chocolate flavors give this beer a classic stout character while some dark fruit raisin-type notes add complexity. Body is dextrinous and chewy but its easy to forget that this is a BIG beer, considering the crisp finish with aromatic hop echoes and just the right amount of sweet-sour persistence that most certainly pays off. Creamy and smooth, the alcohol lurks in there like a spectre, only the faintest hint of a boozy presence. Superb balance and carbonation level. Once you go Obsidian you may never go back.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 31, 2013"

4.81,14.5,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"I moved to Portland OR metro area in 2003 and always loved how the pacific NW caters to stout lovers... I have drunk a lot of beer in my life (much of it bad), and though I always liked how the microbrew phenomena coincided with my achieving legal drinking age. Sadly, though, the Atlantic seaboard does not carry many dark beers, hence my equal love for IPAs... Back to the review... I'm not a beer geek, but I love well crafted things in general. Deschutes Brewing has always been great with balancing fine beer with mass production (except maybe for JubelAle) and obsidian stout has been at the top of my list for 10 years running. Equal layers of coffee, chocolate , with a slight tobacco and leathery sweetness (yes, I've tasted leather). The mouthfeel is like real maple syrup consistency with a whipped foam coffee aftertaste. Just bitter enough to remind you that bitter is a masculine taste profile. The beer is hearty like a bowl of chunky soup, without the chunks. It drinks likes meal. If you find this on nitro, get it, as it lightens the beer while adding richness. Second only to Alameda black bear on nitro, but tops on a regularly available beer of any kind. I have loved European beer for far longer, but have a difficult time justifying their cost when craft brewers like Deschutes keep it real! This is the best value of any stout on the market, folks. Enjoy it when you can.","Bosazga","Oct 11, 2013"

A classic example in every sense of the way. If there's one gripe I have, and it's a small one, it's that the sweetness can get a touch cloying when drinking this beer too fast; a virtual catch 22, because this beer is so enjoyable, it's hard not to want to take drink after drink in quick succession.","TheSixthRing","Jun 11, 2013"

If there are any lovers of imperial stouts out there who are skeptial of a regular stout's capacity to sufficiently satisfy their selachian and senual cravings for scrumptious stouts... YOU MUST TRY THIS NOW... or I will annihilate you with my aggravating alliterative abilities. The label on the neck of the bottle reads "Give in to the deep, dark spell as the layers unfold," and "Like the plot of some eerie mystery you can't put down." (Haha, I love it.) Anyway, the layers did unfold. I gave in. And I couldn't put it down... because this stout treated me to one HELL of a mind-blowingly pleasant experience.","Kuaff","Jun 11, 2013"

Deschutes pretty much goes to the basics and still creates a fascinating and flavorful product in the process. It's dry, earthy, very much on the barley side, but also has a touch of sweetness, chocolate, and hoppiness that really keeps everything balanced. It does this all without being too heavy. I do enjoy Black Butte more for it's extra hop and more complex malt profile, but this is definitely an excellent beer. I really want to try this on nitro-tap. In a way, a great ode to Irish dry stouts with a West Coast twist!","magictacosinus","May 27, 2013"

4.33,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Awesome take on the American stout style by Deschutes. This is basically Black Butte on steroids- more flavour, even blacker and did I say more flavour? The flavour from the roast malt, which is what I love about Black Butte, is even more intense here. The hoppiness is also higher as well. I have to say that the other big difference is that Obsidian brings a bigger bitter quotient, as evidenced in the earthy bitterness that I don't notice much of at all in Black Butte. It also leaves a dry finish, whereas Black Butte will quench my thirst if I'm feeling thirsty. I really love this beer and I'm going to grab a sixer or two every time I return to Minnesota. I haven't seen this in Illinois yet, but once it shows up there, I won't return to Wisconsin without it. One of the finest examples of an intense, hoppy American stout that I've had!

The carbonation is well used to make the beer go down a little easier than with an extremely heavy stout. Tasting notes are pretty typical of a stout, but it seems to pour well, and drink better than most.","millsn1","Apr 02, 2013"

In the initial taste, one detects dark chocolate, coffee, and a slight metallic taste. Being a little thinner than I would have expected for a stout, the heavier tastes disappeared with the metallic taste being more apparent. There was a certain degree of milkiness in this stout, but it lacked smoothness. It certainly lacked any measure of sweetness. In a sense, it made me think of instant coffee without the grittiness. A bitter coffee aftertaste finished the experience. In the scope of other stout, I am not sure anything stood out about this one.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 25, 2013"

Thankfully, the light at the end of the tunnel is near, or should I say the light on top the beer is near (neer). By light I mean head, yes is topped off with a really nice and thick light brown head, just a few shades lighter than brown sugar. It looks and feels light and fluffy and it slowly thins out into a layer of brown bubbles and thick wall of brown lace. The aroma itself isn’t all that impressive to me, I can pick up hints of chocolate, mild coffee, roasted coffee bean followed by that slightly tart coffee aroma. Now for the fun part, relatively light on the mouth feel and it thickens up to about a medium body when it hits the back of your mouth. Bitter overall, it’s sharp on the tip of your tongue but I can’t pick up much flavor until it starts reaching the back of my mouth, only then can I pick up some coffee grinds, mild cocoa, roasted almonds and a slight toffee flavor too.

A pretty damn awesome strong and bitter roasted coffee flavor is the first to introduce itself, this is followed by some bittersweet chocolate and liquorice. Underneath the entire sip is a vanilla like sweetness that I didn't at first detect. A nice, bitter flavor lingers in the aftertaste. A nice, creamy body to this. I slacked on giving this one a try for the longest time and realize that this was a mistake. This is a great stout and worth all the love it receives.","denver10","Jan 24, 2012"

Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a bit fuller as some roasty malts come to the forefront, burnt coffee grounds, some caramel, toffee, dark cocoa and some more burnt roasty grains. Moves into sweet toffee and caramel, to temper the roast. A touch dry finish, moving into lingering roast and silky sweet malts of cocoa, toffee, and milky chocolate.

For this review, I was served on nitro-tap from a local bar in San Francisco's North Beach. This beer is a delight start to finish with lasting chocolate and coffee flavors, a creamy, delicate mouthfeel (partly due to the nitro), and overall a balance of alcohol and stouty flavors that leaves little to be desired.

There's also a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is good and malty, the brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and charred/burnt malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, with the roasty/charred bitter flavors being the strongest. There's also some light hops noticeable, along with a roasty/ashy bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and has moderate carbonation. It also goes down easy enough. I think this is a good brew, definitely worth a try.","bluejacket74","Dec 31, 2011"

This beer is as black in color as beer can be. The head was nearly brown, nice and fluffy, but did fade away early on. There is a smoky, roast malt aroma, but it is not as strong as I would have expected. Flavor is intense roast malt, smoke and has a bitter rasp on the finish. Big long aftertaste. I can drink Guinness all day, I enjoy a porter now and then, but American Stouts are just a bit too much beer for me. I give the Obsidian a good rating in a style of beer I have yet to grow into.","iSip","Dec 19, 2011"

4.42,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate chip cookie dough. Taste is of roasted malt, coffee beans, and the chocolate chip cookie dough flavors. A very mild roasty and sweet flavor lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout that is very tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 09, 2011"

4.43,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Given that this beer's sister, Black Butte porter, has the highest ranking of all the beers I've reviewed this far, I had high expectations for this beer. They were met. While obsidian doesn't push the envelope too much and the mouthfeel can't quite match Black Butte, it is one hell of a beer. Despite being over two years old, this stout remained delicious and had substantial head retention and lacing. At around $6.50 for a sixth of this in Oregon, it is the perfect camping beer during my annual northwest roadtrip and the geologist in me can't help but love the name.","Bockrules","Sep 14, 2011"

Smell notes of strong espresso, chocolate, and roasted malts. Wow....great coffee taste, Hersey Kiss flavored chocolate, with a backbone of peanut butter. Mouthful is crisp, carbonation is spot on, but the beer seems to be a little on the thin side, but every other aspect of the beer makes up for it. Overall an amazing American Stout.

Mellow chocolate and roasted malt aromas. Velvety smooth, with a delicate feel, but at the same time a bit thick. Sweet chocolate and roasted malt flavors up front and into the middle. Bitter hops begin to show thru in the middle as the raosted malt flavor deepens to a nearly burnt flavor, but never actully gets there. Dark roasted malt flavors, with a hint of coffee through to the finish. Finished semi-dry with roasty, bitter hop aftertaste.","IronLover","Jun 28, 2011"

4.46,6.2,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Smell-wise, it's rather standard with hints of chocolate and coffee. It tastes like stouts of similar quality; the thing that sets it apart are the body and creaminess.

At 6.4% ABV and $6-7 for a six-pack here in Portland it is a heck of a deal.

4.17,-0.7,5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Over the years I have waffled over what I considered Deschutes's greatest strength as a brewer: they make a lot of good pale ales, yet their Black Butte porter is the very archetype of its style, for those that have access to it. The fact that such a brewery can also brew an export stout that is so similar in some ways to the porter, yet make each product stand apart from the other when it counts, is testament to the exceeding mastery possessed over the porter-styles in general (and perhaps an even greater harbinger than is the appeal and popularity of their more limited imperials, such as The Abyss.)

Somewhat of a coffee taste as well. Taste is somewhat bitter for a stout, bit by no means too bitter. Mouthfeel is very light for a stout, seems very thin, not a bad thing, just surprising. I do get hints of the coffee I smelled, and of course large quantities of the malts I mentioned. Decent carbonation, more than some stouts I've had. I taste the slightest hint of oats, this is by no means an oatmeal stout, but I get small hints of it. Drinkability is pretty high, only because it tastes pretty darn good! I wouldn't call this a "world class" beer, but it is very, very good.","iLovehops23","Mar 22, 2011"
3.59,-14.5,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"D - Drinkability is moderately high.

3.66,-12.9,4,3,3.5,5,4,"Obsidian pours pitch black, with a massive, 3.5 finger foamy cap. The head is a bit light, closer to off white than tan or caramel. Retention is solid, and lacing is above average. There are rings of foam left around the glass from the head's semi-slow descent. There's a heavy general roast presence in the nose, along with some tobacco and a little bit of dark chocolate. The tobacco fades out, and dark chocolate steps up a bit in the front of my palate, a noticeable improvement. The hop bite mid sip is enough to be noticed, but only just, and gives way to a pleasant earthy finish. The mouthfeel is easily the highlight of this beer. Body is absolutely perfect, full and creamy without getting too big for for its britches and approaching imperial level viscosity. At the same time the carbonation is enough to thwart any syrupy sensation and let the hops peek through, while remaining true to the beer's malty nature. Obsidian Stout is a solid beer from Deschutes, but nothing earth shattering.","axeman9182","Feb 28, 2011"
3.93,-6.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a nice very dark brown (almost black) with about ½ finger of coffee-colored head. Smell is minimal, mostly coffee roasted malt.

Definitely worth drinking again.","xnicknj","Feb 18, 2011"

There are roast notes on the nose that also happen to nicely balance out with the sweet notes that are most prevalent upfront. The taste is quite similar to the nose only I believe the more prevalent flavor in this instance is the roast and the caramel, toffee, malt flavor takes a back to the darkness. The mouthfeel is pretty well balanced for the roast that is involved on this level of a stout. Overall if I rated solely to style this may have gotten all 5s for the simple fact that this beer is how I would make an American stout if I spent the time developing a recipe. This is a really good stout and proves that Deschutes knows what they are doing in that brewery.","Vdubb86","Jan 24, 2011"

Pours an impenetrable black, with a half-inch khaki head that retains very well and leaves lots of lacing. In the bouquet, dark malts contribute cocoa, espresso, roast and dark berries, and there is a kiss of hops in the back. Very roasty, almost burnt malts lead into a strong bitter from the piney hops while blackberries and cake batter meld with fruity yeast. Delicate and layered. Medium to full body, dry and chalky, with low carbonation and a long bitter finish. It has quite a strong flavor, but it is nuanced and well-balanced. A wonderful beer that is well-worth seeking out.","mmmbeer","Jan 24, 2011"

I do get hints of the coffee I smelled, and of course large quantities of the malts I mentioned. Decent carbonation, more than some stouts I've had. I taste the slightest hint of oats, this is by no means an oatmeal stout, but I get small hints of it. Drinkability is pretty high, only because it tastes pretty darn good!

I sort of felt about it the same way I feel about India Pale Ales: I prefer American Pale Ales or Double IPAs, but IPAs are somewhat annoying to me. APAs are mostly balanced with a slight hop bitterness, and DIPAs are very hoppy and alcoholic. But IPAs are only hoppy, which I don't really like. In a similar way, with dark beers I prefer a sweet/balanced Porter or a big, complex Russian Imperial Stout, but Stouts are often just bitter. I guess I don't like bitterness to be the foremost characteristic of a beer, I like bitterness to only have a supporting role to the flavor profile.","humuluslupulus8","Dec 21, 2010"

Chocolatly malty goodness with no bitter after taste. As it warmed, it just got better and better--I even splashed a bit of Lindeman's Framboise into the last three ounces or so to make a GREAT raspberry stout.

3.88,-7.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A moderately stout stout. Not as in-your-face as Old Rasputin; more in line with Guinness, but with more alcohol, so you get a nice mellow buzz. The taste makes you want to come back for more, although if you have been away from stout for a while you have to take a couple sips to get back in the groove. In fact, you better have self control, because you will want to drink it all up. I went driving down route 97 in Oregon a few years ago, and this brew makes me think of the volcanic region south of Bend.

Pure black liquid, however, looks entirely unblemished and possessed of a sleek shininess. The nose has a pleasingly subdued roastiness to it, slowly unfolds oatmeal, cherry to black grape fruit scents, German chocolate cake, coconut flakes and mixed nuts, more grains than coffee, caramel elevates through the end, balanced and simply presented. Medium-bodied, same general demeanor here, sticks to representing the category rather than reaching for greater heights. Burnt cocoa powder, dark chocolate, grilled nuts and sweet cherry, blackberry, plum fruit lend familiarity. The carbonation has a slow muscular churn to it, helps to get the hoppiness up into the air, bringing snappiness to the proceedings. Not that rich nor sappy but the flavors continue on for some time after you swallow. If you are looking for a basic stout that isn't too creamy, here it is.","farrago","Aug 06, 2010"

The aroma is not very prominent, but there are hints of chocolate and dark caramel sweetness that are discernable. The flavor is a real winner, though, with a big bitter chocolate flavor and a subtle underlying sweetness. The heavily roasted malts are right out in front, but rather than being harsh, the dark roasted malts are quite mellow, allowing the flavor to shine without overpowering with bitterness. A fizzy carbonation makes this one go down easily, but I think I would have preferred a creamier texture. Overall, although this stout does not knock it out of the park in every aspect, the great flavor profile makes this one a great choice.","devilben02","Jul 29, 2010"

[insert loud, slow exhalation/fake crowd cheer here] The beer pours a verrrry slightly translucent deept brown, highlighted in dark garnet, topped by a relatively short-lived finger of light ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises deep chocolate, molasses, caramelized sugar, dark roasted malts, and a vague background sense of roasted marshmallows. The taste focuses on the roastier notes, though the molasses and newcomer and cousin maple syrup lead an attempted and vain coup on behalf of the sweeter notes. A touch of smoke finds its way into the finish. The body verges on a heavy medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth and somewhat thin feel. Overall, a more-than-solid stout, one that I could easily see myself drinking on a regular basis, if possible.","TMoney2591","Jul 17, 2010"

Plenty of dark roasted malt flavor with a definitive hoppy finish to drown the palate in beery ecstasy making the lucky imbiber want to take in more of this delicious nectar. Mouthfeel is one of the best around, not thin but chunky and chewy with lots of texture. Drinkability is surprisingly high. It's not uncommon for me to drink a few of these in a single sitting while enjoying the world go by. Believe it or not, it makes the movie "Bound" even better.

The aroma consists of a complex blend of roasted malt, chocolate, leather, and smoke or ash. There is a lot going on with this stout. The flavor is complex as well. Roasted malt gives the base with a burnt bitterness, but there is also bitter chocolate, some dark, dried fruit like prunes, and finishes with an ash, smokey flavor. Overall bitterness is moderate to high. Hard to pick out any sweetness in this one. In fact it makes it a little difficult to drink. Has a hardy body but it is a bit overcarbonated making it seem lighter than it really is.

This one has a bit of uniqueness that separates it from the generic stout, but that also makes it a bit strong in flavor to drink a ton of - it begins to wear at the tastebuds in a good way... the sweet, sour, roasted, and burnt flavors are incredible but take a turn away from sessionability in my mind. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance, if nothing else than do see what a stout has the ability to be. This one nears an Imperial Stout in the best ways.","djeucalyptus","Oct 11, 2008"

There is plenty of roasted, toasted, deliciously whoppin malts, a very nice bitter hop counterpoint and some fruit, a bit of full roast coffee. Very, very nice.

Dark alchol soaked cherries wraped in coco grace the tongue on first sip. A clean biscuit like richness fills the mouth joined by dark malt and slight spiceyness.

As the head dwindles even fine lacing is left evenly behind in an annular ring like pattern. Aroma is full of dark creamy yet mildly acidic coffee roasts, dark chocolate strong herbal hop leaf approach as well. Awesome creamy robust roasted malt layers with a fine herbal hop aroma. Flavors blend poetically, a beautiful clash of cream caramel and mild toffee liqueur with brash dark roasted malts bringing burnt toast, chocolate, and robust espresso to the mix. Mouthfeel is medium bodied doesn't way you down at all drinks like a light beer easy moderate carbonation yet a bitter dry roasty finish makes it all so good velvety smooth on the palate.

I nice fluffy tan head that fades to sticky lacing patterns. The smell is similar to the last bunch of Stouts that I've sampled in that the aroma through the head is different than the surface smell. An agitated whiff reveals a creamy alcohol, like a barrel aged treated product, dark chocolate and caramel that is altogether creamy. Closer to the surface exposes a roasted malt and coffee notes. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is medium, but the rich full flavors take you to a heavier place. The flavor is special. A creamy, milky semisweet lightly roasted malt with subtle chocolate and a perfect little grainy coffee and alcohol flavor that lingers really nicely. This is an easy drinker.

Smell is not quite black licorice but more of a slight anise smell. This one started out strong but there was not a lot of flavor here. Some chocolate, coffee but it is all muted.

Very complex yet suprisingly smooth. One thing I did like is that the mouthfeel wasnt too heavy. Some stouts its like drinking motor oil, this was a little lighter and easier to drink.

The smell has a verylight aroma of cream and some relatively light roastiness. The flavors of light roastines, huge creaminess, lingering licorice bitterness, and touch of malty sweetness are very well integrated and balanced. Delicious. Super creamy, easy-drinking mouthfeel, somewhat light but easy going. I always thought this beer was a little overrated, having it this way changed my mind.","Georgiabeer","Dec 07, 2007"

Chocolate and coffee mingle with overpowered hops. Don't know how else to describe it, but there's a crayon-like aroma in there as well. Taste is lightly sweet at first and then turns deeply bitter. Especially in the back. The bitterness of the coffee flavor and hops combine to create an overall bitterness that hits you from all angles. There's also an earthy wood-like flavor in there. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Abrasiveness builds on the tongue as you dig deeper into the glass. This has been a longtime standby that I will continue to revisit as long as the fine folks at Deschutes keep sending it through the bottling line. A classic.","jakon","Sep 29, 2007"

Smell was phenomenal. This is the perfect stout smell, to me anyway. Coffee beans, unsweetened baker's chocolate, a bit of a lactic sourness, some smoke, the smell of dried cereals, and perhaps most importantly, it is bereft of any hops at all. At the very least, it is bereft of any cascade, cenntenial, or any other really piney/citrusy hops, anyway. This is a truly great stout. Taste starts out a bit sweet, and then turns dry toward the finish. Flavour profiles include coffee grounds, a bit of caramel, bitter chocolate, and a tiny touch of smoke.

The chocolate dominates the other two, but it is balanced with the roasty bitterness. There is a real sweet finish, almost a caramel flavor.

Taste is a pretty bold flavor of dark coffee and some roasted caramel malt as well. There's a nice hop bite on the tongue that balances this one out quite well. Very strong enjoyable aftertaste of espresso with a hint of caramel. Mouthfeel is very full bodied with a surprisingly good amount of carbonation for this style.

Taste is most excellent. Dark malts, coffee, chocolate, everything you would expect from a stout of this caliber. Mouthfeel is smooth, but dry, very easy going down. If it weren't for the 6-something% abv on this, I could drink this all day. Very drinkable stout and one of my favorites.

4.42,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very dark, faint chestnut edges with a fluffy, dark tan head. Plenty of lacing and good head retention. Nice aroma! A mix of roast, cocoa powder, milk chocolate, biscuity malt and a hint of licorice. The flavour's top notch as well. Along with the solid roastiness, there's a lot of anise throughout. Notes of bittersweet chocolate and light fruit round things out. Moderate to low bitterness. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation and a silky texture. Great stout with a nice balance of flavours. Definitely a winner.","DrJay","Apr 08, 2007"

Aroma promises strong malts: chocolate, meat, pepper, and a relatively noticeable alcohol presence  not especially strong or pleasant smelling. Medium body and a creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is dark roasted malts, very meaty; molasses, walnut, pork loin, and charcoal, with an undertone of acidic grassiness thrown in. A touch of soft-candy sweetness in the finish. Aftertaste is mostly neutral with a hint of bitterness and acidity.","Night","Apr 07, 2007"

If I had this on tap at a bar, I would have ordered a second round right from the first sip. The flavors never leave and never tone down. Such an awesome beer on every level.

The smell is mainly of chocolate, but a dark cocoa kind of chocolate and some whiff of alcohol to it - a roasty, but not smoky, smell.

Beautiful raised hop vine design between the neck and the body of a very tastefully designed and informative label. Best by date of August 19 2006, so it's a bit old, but at 6.4% abv, I'm sure this has held up well. Poured into a nonic this stout sports an impenetrable brown-black, burnished and burnt chocolate body with deep russet and burgundy highlights and a sizeable and luxuriously dense, crater-pocked beige head. The nose is dark fruits at first, with dried cherry essence, Black Mission Fig juice, and stewed prunes coming through most strongly. Subsequent sniffs yield aromas of dark-roasted grain and caramel toffee. Then a mocha-coffee scent emerges as it warms. Interesting smell for a non-Imperialized stout! The first sip of this stout screams perfection. Without a doubt. Chewy, surprisingly viscous body with an amazing nearly-burnt roasted quality to the grain flavors that never becomes too bitter because of a lucious black cherry nectar and toffee-chocolate truffle taste that emerges at the finish, which ends in a powerfully bittersweet medicinal flourish. Much heavier on the palate than most representatives of the style. I'd usually find this distracting, but with the utterly fascinating flavor profile of this beer, I can't help but consider the heavier-than-usual weight to be a simple reassertion of the overall force of this masterful stout. I want more.","orfeu","Jan 05, 2007"

After a agonizingly slow pour, with the last drizzles of the 12oz bottle oozing out like oil, it left a jet black color with a dense, 2.5 finger tan head. Beautiful. Aroma is very complex with blends of sweetness, alcohol notes, roasted maltiness, coffee, chocolate, a very pleasing mixture. The taste is just as complex as the aroma, but bordering on perfection. First impression is a biting tingling on the tongue with a slight bitterness that fades into a robust earthy toasted malt with splashes of coffee, chocolate and a finishing mild bitterness. And afterall that you have an aftertaste of roasted nuttiness. As it warms it gets even more complex....excellent. Mouthfeel is good, creamy, and complete.

The nitro gives a smoothness that unveeils the flavors before you with chocolate, burnt caramel and a softly balanced bitterness in its aftertaste.

I also find some slight fruit (rasberry) and even some roasty malt in there. I get a rasberry chocolate icecream aroma mainly. Maybe even some grains (oats). Very brilliant! Sipping it, I first notice the creaminess of it really. Full body with a slight tingly carbonation on the tip of my tongue, but the smooth body takes over quickly. At first I can taste the rasberries along with a big roasty malt. Some mocha coffee comes through as well, and the end is balanced out nicely by bitterness of the hops, which are just slightly grassy or a bit of pine.

I have to take this beer as a whole though. Some movies start slow but have a hell of a finish this Stout falls into that category. It leaves me on a positive note but the first impression cant escape my memories either. All in all, this is clearly a well-brewed beer. I like it. I purchased a couple bottles from Liquid Solutions. I am happy I finally got to try this stalwart of BA Top 100 beers. Worth a try.","bditty187","Jan 27, 2006"
4.3,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"As it pours the head takes time to develop. It expands into only a small crust on top, the color of the foam being a very reddish brown/tan. It then dissipates pretty quickly also. The beer color is very dark black, not much light penetrates. The smell is amazingly smoky and burnt, with maybe a hint of chocolate. Taste is more smokiness, reminiscent of a campfire. Burnt coffee flavors are present also before the right amount of bitterness shines through at the finish. For a stout, it's not real thick, the carbonation is low but adequate. Suprisingly drinkable beer, maybe because its not too strong or chewy like some in its class.","bennetj17","Jan 21, 2006"

The aroma is comprised of lots of chocolate notes with small hints of roasted malts and plenty of malty goodness. Promising. The flavor follows suit with the aroma. Lots of chocolate malty flavors along with some roasted notes. This beer is extremely smooth and creamy. Very very tasty beer. Nothing is offensive and everything blends well.","clvand0","Jan 17, 2006"

Pours almost back with a medium brown head that lasted to the end, leaving a touch of lacing on the side of my pint glass on the way down. Smell is mostly of dark chocolate but is rather delicate, almost too slight, but still very nice. The taste starts with strong coca notes but seamlessly transitions through toasty malts to an excellent dry hop finish. The mouthfeel is very round, smooth, and chewy. The carbonation level is just right. This stout is very complex but not at all difficult to drink. None of the flavors are overpowering and with a very velvety mouthfeel the first pint begs a second.","Bcant","Jan 16, 2006"
4.52,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a deep brown to black color with a sparse coating of light tan head over top. Nose is nice and chocolatey sweet with a background of ashy roasted malt. Good balance between sweetness and roast in this one. Flavor is nice as well. Mostly chocolate in the start, with the roasty and light hoppy bitter on the finish giving a light coffee note to it. Bitter doesn't hang on too long, but stays around just long enough. Feel is velvety smooth and creamy but nice and thick with a minimal carbonation. This is an incredible stout. The beer is in very good harmony with itself. Flavor and aroma meld very well. I don't remember what I said about this before, but I am a big fan of what I just drank.","kmpitz2","Jan 16, 2006"

3.9,-7.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The taste is sharp, with a burnt acidity to it up front. This is balanced by a soft creamy mouthfeel that starts in the middle and carries through almost to the end. The finish is dominated by roasted notes quite similar to the finish of an espresso; acidity and roasted / burnt notes. For all of the roast character it is quite smooth, it is lack that burnt-husk astringency that can be found in some stouts. Having said that, the roasted acidity here is a bit too much; there needs to be a bit more something (sweet malt would do it) to balance it out. Perhaps a bit of age would do the trick as well; I have a feeling this might mellow out over 6 months or so.","Gueuzedude","Jan 05, 2006"

A wine expert, tasting Deus, said it was a great beer, but still "short," leading him to say that he couldn't see paying champagne prices for beer -- a taste that "disappears immediately." I can say without hesitation that the aforementioned "wine expert" has never tried Obsidian Stout. You should.

4.35,3.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From a bottle that conveniently fell off the truck at the WBF last weekend in Durham. Pours a deep, dark, almost pitch black, with an inch or so of creamy dark tan head on top. Big aroma of rich roasted malt, espresso, prunes, a touch of phenol, and a faint whiff of brown sugar. Palate is lightly sweet up front, with the huge yet mellow maltiness and flavor of very dark chocolate taking over as it passes the tip of the tongue. Slightly roasty on the finish, with notes of dark fruit and just the slightest bit of hop bitterness at the end. Smooth, creamy body is like velvet. Slow-drinking, but immensely enjoyable.

This brew has this perfect creamy mouthfeel leaving just the right amount of dryness in the end. Wow, what a great beer! Overall drinkability is almost exceptional.

It is a bit dry and creamy. This is a very flavorful stout. It is uncompromising with the use of black malts; very nice. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

Strong roasted aroma very characteristic of a stout - kind of like an original Guinness, but somehow even more so. There's a pleasant sharpness in the flavor, yet it's irresistably smooth... you'd never know there was 6+% ABV in this beer. Bitter chocolate, espresso flavors are very strong - why, oh why can't Starbucks make a shot that tastes this good? Mouthfeel is almost oily, but in a good way... not too carbonated, not too flat feeling.

This is a nice looking brew. The aroma is all roasted malts, chocolate, slightly vinous, almost sour, and quite intense. The taste is a lovely blend of the afforementioned roasted black malts, coffee, dark chocolate, herbal hops, and more. Aftertaste is long, lingering, and full of bitter chocolate, and roasty malt notes. Mouthfeel is thick and coating. Almost too much, if you ask me.

Aromas are dominated by roasted malts, with a little chocolate and burnt aromas also present. There is also a slight nutty character and some sweet molasses in the air as well. Initially this beer has a very robust malt profile. The roasted flavors just scream out at you initially with nice chocolate, smokey, and sweet coffee like flavors. There is a nice creamy texture to this beer and some oat like flavors make their way into the middle of the taste. This beer is also very thick and almost chewy in the body. Just a delicious feeling on the pallate. This beer finishes bittersweet, with a slight bitterness from the hops but an almost molasses sweetness that fights back and forth to make this beer just incredible.

A handsome, two-finger cocao brown head that leaves smudges of lace graces the top. The aroma features big toasted barley notes with the underlying Deschutes-level dose of Cascade hops. Chocolate, chicory and toasted rye also come to mind. The taste is something to behold and it makes this one of the finest tasting stouts around. Big chocolate flavors lay the foundation, with a sweet, almost fruity middle before a pretty dry, bitter and toasty finish. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but not so much so that it precludes warm-weather drinking. Drinkability is fantastic. They don't come much better than this.","MobBarley","May 27, 2004"

The head is a tan monster that sticks to the side of the glass and leaves little islets over the top of the beer. Roasted malt, coffee, and just a trace of nut swirl around nicely.

It settles into something a little more dense later on. Nice black and when you get to the bottom of the glass, you notice its base is a nice ruby. Heavy on the caramel, a little roasty, but not really a big flavor for a stout. The body could benefit from a slightly lower level of carbonation.","aracauna","Jan 18, 2004"
3.86,-8.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours like 40 weight -- a beautiful thick, dark brown, with a small but creamy brown head to match. Smelled like malted coffee, but not as strong as I expected (or would have liked). Thick mouthfeel that actually felt 'heavier' than other beers to me -- like my tongue was getting a workout just bearing the weight and pushing it back into my throat. Rich roasted flavor with hints of hickory. Very enjoyable for a dessert beer or treat, and taste-wise I could drink a few, but I think I'd either get full or a tired tongue before I drank too many.","jtfest","Jan 12, 2004"
3.95,-6,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Deschutes has some new labels on their bottles. White label with colorful scenic artwork and best-buy date. A pitch black beer with decent head that dwindles but does not disappear, good lacing. Aroma of roastiness and somewhat fruity yeast. An impressive stout, not quite an impy but darn close. Lots of flavor here, with big roasted barley qualities with light herbal bitterness that disappears as the beer gets warmer. Mouthfeel smooth and milky. Not the easiest beer to drink, maybe because of alcohol and not a very dry finish. Deschutes are always good, and consistent if maybe a little predictable, but usually excellent taste and reliability are more than enough.","Thrasher","Jan 07, 2004"
4.13,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"It pours a nice rich black coffee color with a firm tannish head and some sticky, webby lace. A smoky toasty malt aroma blends with a pungent hoppy smell. The medium malt body is fairly sweet with flavors of coffee and dark chocolate. Plenty of Northwest-style Hoppy bitterness cuts through the sweetness. The head Stays On!","BeerResearcher","Jan 05, 2004"
4.75,13.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Before I knew it, that pint was gone. Silky smooth, finely balanced between chocolatey sweetness and coffee bitterness, Obsidian Stout is so very easy to drink. Glad I purchased a six-pack as this brew has surpassed Kalamazoo Stout as my favorite stout.","Boilermaker88","Dec 30, 2003"
4.07,-3.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark chocolate brown but in the glass is inpenetrable obsidian. No head, just a scattering of foamyness hear and there. Aromas of dry cocoa and dark chocolate eminates from my Duvel tulip. I taste complex notes of high quality dark chocolate, although it is fleeting. I'd like it to hang around a bit longer. Well balanced with moderate hoppiness. Not as dimensional as the imperial stouts that I have been favoring as of late, but this isn't imperial. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. It is a very good regular stout. Very drinkable.","HiroProtagonist","Dec 26, 2003"
4.05,-3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours deep balck with small dark a head. Nice chunky lace on the side of the galss. Aroma is chocolate, espresso and drak fruit (raisin ?) Flavor is weet chocolate, mild hop bitterness and a creamy latte taste on the back end. Very nice beer, almost would classify it a sweet stout.","CRJMellor","Dec 23, 2003"
4.45,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A nice and big stout from the Pacific Northwest. Very black in color with brown head. Roast malt and coffee aromas pours out of the glass, slightly smokey and slightly sweet...very nice. The flavors lean heavily on the roast malt/coffee side with enough sweet malt and nuttiness to balance. It is medium bodied with some chocolate and licorice in a nice dry finish. Highly recommended for the serious stout lovers.","jeffboo","Dec 09, 2003"

3.53,-16,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: A decent stout, but nothing all the special IMO. My least favorite offering from this brewery.","winomark","Oct 28, 2003"
4.28,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This reminded me a lot of Shakespeare Stout, and it's almost as good. Extremely dark brown body (not quite "obsidian" black), with a light brown head. Smell is rich raisiny malts, chocolate rum ice cream, and alcohol. Taste starts with peat-soaked roasted malts, a touch of sweetness, balanced nicely with some hops. Finish is chocolate bitter with lingering burnt fruit. Another big and chewy stout.","alexgash","Oct 13, 2003"

Now having been a member for over a year and having tasted over 1,000 beers (over 100 stouts alone) I thought I would revisit this fella in 2004. Ill be damned, this is one good stout. I stand by my initial rating. This is one of the best stout buys on the planet.","RoyalT","Oct 09, 2003"

4.13,-1.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"*As my sample warmed, the flavor changed quite a bit. It was much sweeter and that overt bitterness stepped back a few paces. While I initially rated the beer at 3.2, I have now adjusted the score to reflect my opinion. Much better if you drink it at 55 F or above. Would love to try it on tap or cask!","GreenCard","Aug 05, 2003"

Nose has the delightful aroma of toasted grains, Starbucks coffee and bittersweet chocolate, sweet and inviting, as is the malt-laden start with the top thick and chewy. Finish has a spicy hop bite, moderately acidic, bittersweet chocolate dry and a real treat to the palate and a top notch Stout in my book.","Gusler","Mar 24, 2003"

4.37,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pouring this stout was so dark brown that it could almost pass as black. Not a lot of foam but nice lace on the glass. The smell was of a sweet malty chocolate, with a hint of fruit. The taste was a bitter/sweet choclate with a grainy malt flavor, with just a touch of smoke. After drinking this stout, the after taste stays on the palate with a bitter/sweet sensation on the tongue. The after taste just stays on and on and on! What a pleasant surprise!","BeerManDan","Jan 14, 2003"
4.03,-4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Nice black color and a foamy tan head that left real nice lace. This stout had a nice roasted smoky taste.  Good solid stout that can become a regular in one's repotoire.  I enjoyed this with some lamb sausage, ground beef, baked potato and some sourdough bread.  Great for a cold evening.","Mark","Oct 15, 2002"

4.7,11.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The bottle says this beer is as black as the volcanic obsidian rock for which it is named.  I don't see it as quite that dark as some rays of light do indeed get through this brew.  (Bring on the spectrophotometer!)  It IS very close to black however.  It has a nice creamy brown head that laces the glass very nicely as I drink.  Very nice coffee and mocha on the nose.  This beer tastes wonderful.  Beautiful coffee bean and chocolate tones present.  A nice subdued bitterness coming from the roasted malt.  Smooth and velvety.  This is truly a great stout.","Bighuge","Jun 12, 2002"
