When I returned to my seat I realized that I could smell the deep roasted malt and quality coffee from 3 feet away! Very inviting! The taste wasn't what I would expect from the style, almost espresso like. If coffe is your style, then this is your beer. The mouthfeel was disappointing. Thin, and free of any carbonation. Overall a mediocre brew. I would, however, strongly recommend it to my friends who love that that in-your-face coffee taste.","LloydDobler","Mar 22, 2015"

This packs more flavour than our more local New Glarus Coffee Stout, but it hits you a little bit more quickly. Surprising that it isn't as well-received as I'd expect based on my review, but then again Lakefront has a tendency to be underrated. [4]","Stevedore","Oct 19, 2014"

Deep dark hazel brown color, a deep garnet/reddish hue to light. Decent looks, smell is a bit odd, almost a smokey-fish smell initially. Hint of peppers in there, but devoid of heat. Grainy smells, a bit of coffee in there, too. Taste offers more than the aroma, with some decent coffee flavors and dark roasted grains. I still taste a sort of hollow peppers, no heat just the pepper essence. Is that the hops? The hops in this beer, seem buried, with only a bit of their potential peeking out from beneath the malt and roasted tastes. Taste is a bit scatterted, directionless. Wide array of flavors that don't quite mesh together. A "coffee stout" is a stretch.","SamN","Mar 03, 2014"

I got home, saw the score and became disappointed immediately but jumped in with an open mind. IMO this brew is soooo underrated. This is a straight forward, no frills, no nonsense coffee brown, although it claims stout. Only two things hold this back for me-one is the sweetener aftertaste and the other is the thin structure, but hey, neither bother me. This you can literally have in the morning and get a nice buzz to carry you-if you were inclined to do so. Hell, Mikkeller could put this brew in bourbon barrels for a week and sell this for about 6 bucks @ 12oz and receive accolades-I think you get my point. This Fuel Cafe sixpack is at a great price, a Mikkellerish like coffee stout (c'mon some of those overrated), Peruvian Morning aroma, not infected make this a click to pick!","joeseppy","Feb 07, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee bean aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and slightly acidic coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

This stout pours a beautiful chocolately opaque black with a thin tan head around the edge of the glass. I've had MANY porters like this but very few stouts - it seems misnamed. As a stout I would give it a lower grade than if it were classified as a porter. As a stout it lacked the expected body and malty flavor where as a porter it had a very sweet finish - too sweet for me. Billed as "Coffee Flavored Stout" I was wondering where the coffee went - I am an avid coffee drinker and I did NOT get the delivery of coffee at all while many stouts deliver strong espresso aftertastes. As a homebrewer, I know how it is to 'miss your intended style' and this one to me is more at> Porter or a black Belgian Ale style than a stout classification. If I were to rate THIS BEER in a "style class of choice" I would have the highest probable rating for this beer in the Belgian Ale classification with a judged complexity of sweet/sour notes and finishing notably sour.","GoldHorde","Jan 21, 2013"

The watery mouthfeel does not help here, giving the impression of someone trying to disguise a weak porter with a bevy of coffee grounds. And even the coffee grounds aren’t terribly flavorful, equivalent to perhaps pre-ground Folgers, as opposed to fresh-ground Peet’s. Better ingredients, and a better recipe, including several more pounds of good malt, would have done much to make this beer more rounded and flavorful.","jondeelee","Jan 05, 2013"

Color was a deep brown with only cola highlights at the edges. Nose was still rich with French Roast coffee notes. Very dark, very roasty, very coffee-like. I even got some dark chocolate in there as it warmed. Mouthfeel was not quite creamy, but close and the favor had begun to take on a (probably unintended) sourness to accompany the bitterness. It was not overwhelming, but it should be kept in mind if you want to age this beer. Finish was quite bitter, like my morning coffee. As a retired US Navy sailor, I drank my share of bitter coffee. We used to try everything, from ground cinnamon to salt, but when you are making massive amounts in a stainless steel machine, bitter is the name of the game.

It pours a bleakly murky black-brown topped by a finger of sandy ecru foam. The nose comprises coffee, dark chocolate, light roasted malts, and a touch of straight dry malt extract. Not really sure what to think of that last one, frankly. The taste focuses on the coffee, though now it is more sour/astringent than dark/roasty. The dark chocolate returns, along with a beefed-up measure of roasted malts, and the DME seems to have dropped out (though I'm not terribly surprised about that), but everything seems to be dwarfed by the sharp coffee. It's definitely not a train wreck, but it's also definitely not something I would call genuinely enjoyable. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

Uber smoked malt is the main profile player here. It tastes more like smoked meat then coffee. Hints of caramel and bitter hops can be percieved if you really try. It just comes back to smoke though. The beer is medium to light bodied. Very thin with moderate carbonation. This is maybe the weakest offering from a brewery I expect alot from. Well they can't all be winners.

Not a drain pour, but one was definitely enough.","Jwale73","Sep 25, 2008"

3.88,14.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Fuel Cafe pours from the bottle as might be expected, bringing up a full, frothy head of creamy tan over its dark brown-black body. The head holds well, especially given that the oils in coffee would normally kill it, and it leaves some very nice Brussels lace about the glass as it goes. The aroma is more of stout than Starbucks, but there is coffee there, and it is noticeable. In the mouth, the coffee flavor somes on strong with an almost expresso-like character. It acts as the centerpiece, and also the back bone, to the rich maltiness. Some notes of dark, soft caramel and rich chocolate bouy it, and it's quite pleasant and intriguing. Many coffee-flavored beers can push the beans really well, but all too often they end up being just a little too much on the palate as you progress through the glass - even a little too acidic at times, but that's not the case here. Instead, it's fairly well balanced between malt and coffee, and the roastiness and acidity never overpower. Very nicely rounded, I could see having more than one of these in a row, although not too often. Perhaps during a cold winter storm, or a night at the pub with the lads. And I'd certainly be up for buying a six-pack to keep in the fridge for special occassions. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","May 20, 2008"

If, as I do, you like your espresso without all the sugars, flavoring syrups, and other crapola that the coffee joints seem to believe is necessary, this will be a great beer for you. If your idea of great coffee is a strawberry grande latte with extra sprinkles, fuggedaboutit, and while you're at it get out from between me and my coffee and admit that what you really want is a milkshake.

Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I would like. An interesting beer, worth a try.","Drew966","Jun 04, 2007"

The body is drying, light/medium with comparable carbonation, and it leaves a medium finish.

I'm not sure if the tartness is a result of roasting the malts and the tangy acidity that follows or something else, but it masked most of the flavors and was very prevalent.

3.01,-11.2,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Black, maybe a dark brown highlight around the edges but even against a light this beer is black and opaque. The head reached a little over a finger in height, foam color was russet. Head retention was okay; it faded a little too rapidly. Before long the foam had turned into a thin, foamy cap. This cap did have good staying power. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling all that well. The general look of this beer is positive, some of the details are lacking though; otherwise this beer would have had a standout appearance. The nose is roasty with chocolate undertones and some acidity from the roast. Coffee aromas are limited to hints of day old black coffee, very faint at that. A stout brewed with coffee, says the label, the nose says otherwise. Ive had regular stouts that have produced a more potent coffee aroma. The bouquet is simplistic but pleasant. Inviting but nothing special. The palate is good, nothing more, and nothing less. It is not anywhere near Bells Java Stout but much closer to Spilker Ales XPO. Id rather drink the Bells interpretation of the style. Coffee flavors are limited. Roast is slight, some chocolate, and just a dash of creamy sweetness. Acidic at times. Hops dont offer much, some random, light, earthiness maybe. The finish is far too quick and the aftertaste is empty. I cant see this beer working well with food, in large part because the body is too damn thin. Coffee stouts are good with various cakes and even steaks but there is no body here; it couldnt standup to most food. Oh well. Light in body, thin, watery, weak carbonation, the mouthfeel is completely unimpressive and outright disappointing. It is really easy to drink, there isnt much complexity on the tongue that forces you to slow down and really figure the beer out. Plus the body is thin; it slides down like a cool glass of water. Refreshing (!) but a pointless and undesirable quality in a stout. Ive had much beer stouts with coffee; Ill drink those and skip this in the future.

3.41,0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Labeled as Fuel Cafe Coffee Flavored Stout not Fuel City. Hope I'm reviewing the right beer. Pours an opaque darkest brown with a rich tan to brown head. Kind of nutty, roasty and fruity aroma, can't really discern much coffee. Tastes rather thin but a good roasty malt profile. Not picking up on any hops, nor coffee (other than the acidity that coffee would provide to a beer). Sort of like a milk stout. Enjoyable, but not really what I expected.","crookedhalo","0"
2.98,-12.1,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Just one comparison to make...this beer is very similar in build to Guinness Extra Stout. It has that same fruity parts that really put it in a different category as far as flavor and smell is concerned.","Skidz","Jan 11, 2004"

3.38,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The feel is disappointing when compared to the look. Whereas the look is rich and full, the feel is thin and a bit watery - more porter like. The drinkability is limited by the heavy coffee sense and a perceived high ABV.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 16, 2003"
3.6,6.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured like a carbonated cup of coffee. Yep, it has a definite coffee aroma not overpowering but distinct, a subtle chocolate coffee taste with a coffeebean aftertaste. You get a blast of coffee aroma every time you go for a sip. Nice for what it is, not a session beer, but something nice when you want to take a break from the hops.","grynder33","Aug 06, 2003"
3.77,11.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This one is new in our area, so I thought I'd give it a try. Really black with nothing coming through and a small dense head. Aroma is really nice with strong coffee and roasted malt but no noticable hops. Flavor is of coffee and malt that is dry and slightly bitter. Body is maybe a tad thin but pretty decent in my opinion. Overall this is a good stout that's worth a try.","BierReise","Jul 05, 2003"
3.1,-8.6,4,4,3,2,2.5,"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: I normally like the coffee aspect in many Stouts but in this case it is a little too much. Pours like a cup of cold coffee. Very small beige head and thin lacing. Aroma is coffee, coffee, coffee. A little on the thin and brittle side for a Stout. This is actually leaning toward a Porter in many ways. The coffee flavor is dominant, with a slight roasty malt presence, but you have to search for it. The finish is a little watery and maintains the bitter coffee flavor found throughout. Lakefront really seems to be hit and miss to me.","Dogbrick","May 15, 2003"
4.7,38.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is incredibly unique! Reminds me of a german smoked beer with delightful roasted malts and smooth smokey finish. The taste caught me off guard, but is balanced so that the palate quickly adjusts, copes, and then begs for more. This is one to go back to again and again.","TripelJ","Apr 27, 2003"

2.68,-20.9,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Fuel City Coffee Stout: Cripes, I hope there is no caffeine in this, cause its awful late. This is a black beer, not mahogany, black. Decent deep brown head shot up several inches, but settled down to a cream colored head fairly quickly. Hmmm, this coffee stout tastes a lot more like the grounds than the brew. The aroma ain’t bad, the taste just is not there. This beer is very light bodied as well, which is not a compliment. Fey.","jackndan","Apr 02, 2002"
4,18,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a black beer. It is a bit charged. Deep, thick, dense, creamy brown head. Nice chocolate aroma with slight coffee too. Very creamy mouthfeel. Nice lace forms as I drink. There are subtle tastes of blackened malts and java. There's a nice bittersweet chocolate aspect to this brew I like. Medium to full body and very easy drinking for a stout. Good coffee stout, but I wouldn't say it is great.","Bighuge","Feb 25, 2002"
3.01,-11.2,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Overall, I am a bit disappointed in this beer. When I drink a specialty beer, I want to strongly taste the "Specialty" part. This just doesn't pack much punch for a coffee stout (Kalamazoo's Java Stout is considerably better)..this one pours nicely...midnight black with a redish/brown creamy head. The aroma is a bit odd...There are some coffee tones but also almost a spoiled egg smell...There is none of that (spoiled egg) in the taste, but then again there isn't really a huge amount of taste to this. It is definitely on the drier side...and it is thinner than I expected. The taste is a cocoa base with some subdued coffee notes. I expected much more coffee on the nose and the buds. I'm not big into coffee stouts to start with but when I have one I expect more. I would not purchase this one again.","ZAP","Beers"
4.64,36.9,4,5,5,4,4,"Thick black with a brown wispy head. The smell is AWESOME with a dark roasted coffee smell upfront, mingled with roasted malt and some slight yeast and hop aromas. The coffee wasn't overpowering, but it was there, and very pronounced, but still allowing the heavy roasted malt character to come through. A medium hop bitterness cleaned up my palate, but still left some roasted coffee flavor behind. This stout has a thick and rich feel, near-perfect carbonation. I must have more of this stout...","hooligan","0"
