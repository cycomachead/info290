3.96,10.3,4.25,4.5,4,2.75,3.75,"I unscrewed the cap after making my wish (Shhh!) and commenced an aggro pour, resulting in a finger of light-tan head that quickly fell to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like Devils Food Cake or a rich chocolate brownie! Zounds! Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery, especially for a Stout. The taste was really amazing and I really have to give a Tip o' the Wood to the reviewer who said "yellow cake with chocolate icing"! Spot on! I was braced for it to be sickeningly sweet, but it was very pleasant. I did not have a cake since I am not big on sweets, but this stood in nicely in lieu of one. The finish was semi-sweet and the chocolate was not front and center as I imagined, but there was a cake-like flavor leading the way, instead. Happy Beer-thday to us all!","woodychandler","Mar 29, 2015"

Shiner could make a fortune off of this beer if they made it year-round and told Gabriel Iglesias about it, that's how similar it is to chocolate cake.  I haven't tried any other beer from Shiner yet (their Bock is the only one I ever see around here, though I did spot a few others in the Roanoke area alongside this one), but if the special beer for their 107th birthday is on the same level of yumminess as the 106th, I'll be sure to check that out when it comes around.  Heck, I may just have to get some more of their 106th Birthday Beer for my 29th that's coming up in a few months--it'd be a shame to only have this once in my entire life!","Pantalones","Mar 21, 2015"

3.8,5.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/12/2015. Pours slightly hazy very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, cream, and light toast. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa notes; with good strength. Smells exactly like chocolate cake and frosting. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toffee, fudge, cream, light toast, and slight herbal hops. Minimal roast/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, cream, and light toast on the finish for a good bit. Good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and cocoa flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this a very good sweet stout. All around good balance, complexity, and solid robustness of dark/roasted malt and cocoa flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

Smells of sweet malt, strong chocolate, hint of yeast, hint of alcohol, hint of wood, and slight of coconut.  Fits the style of an American Stout.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong chocolate, strong sweet malt, hint of yeast, hint of coconut, and a hint of wood.  Overall, this beer tastes the most similar to actual chocolate cake, than any beer I've ever had.  This was quite appropriate since there is a birthday cake on the bottle.  The chocolate and the sweet malt are very strong, so the balance is off, but I will rate with the intention of making a cake beer in mind.","Tone","Feb 11, 2015"

As some have noted it doesn't necessarily have that much of a "stout flavor", but this is a chocolate stout; don't believe that there is much of an established criteria for a chocolate stout unless you're comparing it to another one. I felt it a had a perfect balance with the chocolate and sweetness; I find many others to have a battle between the chocolate, bitterness and sweetness not blending well on the palate. Not here, maybe because there's not much bitterness here, other than just enough to give it a really good overall balance. To me it tasted like a piece of chocolate cake.... a really good piece of chocolate cake. So far, my favorite chocolate stout I've had to date. I believe this would be a really good beer for a novice beer drinker or perhaps one new to craft beers and/or stouts and maybe doesn't like really dark bitter beers. To me this is a really easy beer for people to like, provided you like chocolate and don't have any preconceived ideas as to what a chocolate stout should taste like.","beerman58","Feb 03, 2015"

If it had a good basic stout flavor that actually had chocolately notes complimented with the addition of natural, subtly flavored chocolate, then this combo might have worked. The chocolate is just too in your face and conflicts with the essential taste of the beer. It's not a horrible beer but it is not a good rich stout.

3.6,0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and i thought it was a pretty average tasting example of the style, when it came to the aroma it was much more chocolate cake like than I ever expected it would be, but that never really carried over to the taste and in the end I was a little let down.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little watery, a little creamy, slightly crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do a great job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, the taste doesn't really make me want to go back for more.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the taste it wasn't bad, but it lacked that rich chocolate cake aspect that the aroma had.  I might buy this beer again if they release it next year, but it isn't something I'm going to stock up on and I would recommend giving it a try if you really like chocolate stout's but I don't find it to be a stand out for the style.  All in all I wasn't to impressed with this beer, the aroma was just a little impressive, but the taste was not and it left me wanting more out of this beer.  So far this beer falls right in the middle for Shiner and I think it's a pretty average example of the style.  This was a decent beer, but with some work it could be much better, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 14, 2015"

The taste is just off putting. I guess it's chocolate, but more of the fake imitation chocolate you run across. It reminds me when as a kid my dad would get cheap and buy the store brand chocolate syrup. Yes it's chocolate syrup, but it was obvious it wasn't the real thing. Outside of the nice smell, this beer is a great example for other on how not to make a chocolate stout.","thereal_adam","Jan 13, 2015"

I think if I were to drink a liquid tootsie roll it would taste like this.  No bitterness present in this stout.  I picked up a 6 pack after having this on tap on NYE.  It is a sweet desert beer and I treat it as such.  It is only a 5.0 ABV.  A little thin for a stout but again I don't think they were trying to put out such a stout.  This is certainly a tasty stout and a treat.  I wouldn't drink one every night but I like having it in the fridge.

The cocoa flavor is very prominent, with an initial unpleasant stale beer flavor right behind that cocoa flavour. What's kind of cool, though, is that the aftertaste is very much like chocolate cake and not unpleasant at all.","ElCommodoro","Jan 02, 2015"

No 'notes' of a stout exist in this beer, that is, it does not taste like any stout I have ever had. It tastes and smells exactly like chocolate cake made from a store bought mix. Avoid it and do not buy as a "birthday beer" for your girlfriend as you will both be quite disappointed, unless you don't care for beer, but enjoy cake from a box mix. I could see somebody in those shoes liking it. I only gave a decent rating for the smell because I like the smell of chocolate cake, from a box mix or from scratch. Shiner, you failed once again. Shabbiest brewery in Texas, hands down.","jgorman29","Dec 30, 2014"

S: rich chocolate and mocha with a hint of bitter hops. Very subtle hints of dark fruit like raisin and date. T: immediately hit with strong dark chocolate, almost too rich, but then the bold chocolate is balanced out with coffee and mocha flavors. Aftertaste leaves mainly mochawithhints of bitter hops and dark fruits. M: smooth, very little carbonation, more dominant froth like you would get from a Guinness.

A decent amount of lacing is seen after each sip that sticks to the glass. The aroma of chocolate hits your nose right up front, more than other similar stouts. Pretty much the same for the taste. More like a dark chocolate beer than a stout. Very smooth and goes down very easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied and perfect carbonation. Have to say that this is one of the best Shiner brews I have had so far. Great job Shiner!","BeerWithMike","Dec 22, 2014"

This wasn't per say as much of a stout as a dark chocolate beer.  But to be honest I found it very drinkable and would be a good beer to finish the nite with without the heaviness of most chocolate stouts.  Kind of sad this is a one and done, this would be a very easy beer to pair with desserts","donspublic","0"
