It's easy enough to find a rye ipa or lighter beer, much harder to find a rye stout. I really enjoyed this quite a bit. Poured dark brown, approaching black, with a creamy head. Smells of spicy rye balanced beatifully with some firm malt and some roastiness. Tastes similar- and very nice. Lovely gobs of spicy rye supported by lightly roasty malt and a huge creaminess. The rye really shines here and isn't overwhelmed by charred notes. Great beer.","Georgiabeer","Mar 31, 2011"

The stout has a very sweet chocolatey caramel flavor, clearly the result of a pleasant malt mixture. The flavors meld together seamlessly, allowing the stout character and a bit of rye sharpness to come together nicelessly. The rye sharpness is a nice undertone that keeps the stout together. The velvety smooth stout is a joy to drink, chocolatey yet silky smooth. A delicious ale. The ale is smooth and sweet, delicious without going overboard on the roasted malt element.","Anthony1","Sep 06, 2010"

3.72,-4.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The flavor finds spicy rye grains battling it out with roasted milk chocolate malts. Earthy, soily hops grab hold of the tastebuds and provide a lasting bitterness. The carbonation was really a sleeper, and it fired up after the pour to lash the palate with spritzy, sharp bubbles on into the finish. Rye eventually pushes out the rest of the malt, unfortunately, because I think the base for this beer is probably delicious. Still, Rye Stout is tasty, and I applaud Bell's for the ingenuity.

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The stout pours near black with a bit of a garnet hue when held to the light. The moderate fluffy tan head diminished to a skin with just a hint of a lace. The aroma is moderately roasty along with some hints of chocolate. The flavor is moderate-high malt, bittersweet upfront followed by roast and chocolate. The roast character of the malt, hop bitterness and maybe rye give a spicy, slightly dry finish that is pleasant and leaves just a bit of bittersweet malt on the palate. Carbonation is moderate and body medium. Overall well crafted stout, rather drinkable yet a lot of flavor. Maybe a bit less roast than most stouts and more bittersweet malt with a spicy/slightly dry finish.","uwmgdman","Feb 09, 2010"

There is a hint of coffee as well. It finishes with a touch of rye sharpness and a mild pine flavor that lingers shortly, then fading away.

Flavor has a very sharp rye flavor - like I'm eating that salami on rye bread. There's a slight off-note on the finish as well. A slight chocolaty component creeps in after several sips, and then fades back to a smoky lingering note. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkability- it's rough to finish this.

As you take first sip you get a hint of the rye feel that comes through as a edgy fruit sweetness and creamy coffee feel. A long dry bitter is actually even and well recieved on the back of the palate. Dryness hints to a twing of sour, but it is shore and gels well.

Taste is a grassy roasted malt with another appearance from the coffee. Slight smokey flavors which is complimented by a chocolate sweetness. Mouthfeel is very light for the style but that's where the rye comes in. A bit of carbonation that tingles the mouth. Alcohol is very well hidden in this brew.

Zero head made it difficult to discern the roasted grain and earthy-spicy rye scents that came through in the aroma. Decent flavor, with coffee and chocolate percolating amidst the prickly rye zing. Detected some carbonation in the mouthfeel, which was otherwise slightly slick and somewhat chewy, so this stuff wasn't totally flat. An interesting flavor profile, but not something I'd go back looking for explicitly.

3.6,-7.5,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Received as part of BIF 33, from orbitalr0x, Bells Rye Stout poured out dark brown and very well carbonated. The head was four fingers thick, and occupied nearly half the pint glass. The smell was mild, and had the typical chocolate aroma typical of the stouts of this strength. The taste was a little too light for the style, with sweet, sour, and grainy flavors. Not sure if I detected any rye in here. The mouthfeel was thin and dry, and aftertaste minimal. I could not detect any alcohol at all, which made this very easy to drink.","rajendra82","May 19, 2006"
3.92,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle pours a dark mahogany body, opaque but not inky. Small tan head quickly subsides and leaves minimal lace. Smells like a sweet stout, initially, with a lacto note. Spicy rye, old coffee, and a vague hint of bittersweet chocolate come on as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium, but thins as it warms. Carbonation is moderate. Taste has lots of spicy rye which infuses the dark roasty stout flavors with a pleasant bite. Some earthy hop character works well. No hint of the abv, making this an easily drinkable addition to the worthy array of stouts by this fine brewery.","merlin48","May 18, 2006"
3.65,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pouring a 12oz into my pint glass, I have sitting before me a nice looking stout. Obsidian in appearance, though not 100% opaque it is close. The head doesn't stay for long, but forms a creamy khaki ring that clings to the sides of my glass. The aroma is big and bold, rye and raw grain up front, with plenty of coffee and chocolate, as well as some caramel and breadiness, spicy notes becoming more pronounced as the beer warms. Flavor is crisp, the grains sharp, these impressions accentuated by tight carbonation. Raw grain collides with roasted barley and produces some bitter espresso and unsweetened chocolate flavors in the process. Possibly some oats too, there is a smoothness under all of the brackish grain. There is an obvious spiciness, can't quite be attributed to hops, most likely due to the rye. Yeasty breadiness is also floating around in my mouth. Finish is complex - spicy, dry & roasty, and some bitter, slightly sour lactic flavor that borders on acidity. Definitely an interesting take on an American Stout. Bell's knows their stouts, and aren't afraid to experiment. This isn't a beer for everyone, but is worth checking out.","BeerFink","May 11, 2006"

Aroma is of roasted malts, a darkish chocolate and a faint bready something that just must be rye I suppose. A rather nice mouth, smooth and warm and dry. Tastes of a rich, almost subdued roasted malt with chocolate tones, and where the nose was faintly bready the taste is fainly wood-like.

Aromas of rye, wheat, grain, malt and roasting meat are unique and enjoyable. Taste is medium full bodied and totally quaffable; dried sugar cane, roasted malt, grainy rye, some bread and biscut notes, touches of dark chocolate. Best flavor in an American Stout i've had.

A thin, dense head remains to the bottom of the glass. Smooth and sweet in the same Oatmeal Stout sort of way. Sweetness depends on big barley additions, roasted grains, and lactose. Smoothness depends on oats and milk sugars. Rye (pumpernickle rye bread) flavors add a grain, earthy, dusty character. A grain-husk bitterness rides into the finish. Lowly hopped and to offset the sweetness only--contributes little to the finish brew. Quite clean in the finish with a light residual milky flavor and texture.","BEERchitect","Mar 15, 2006"

For is spicy and tobacco tinged with the flavor what I imagine hot water that had had rye seeds steeped in it would taste of. Spicy pepper notes tickle the tonsils as I swallow. A smooth choclate malt flavor runs through all ranges. The finish kind of reminds me of a very toned down version of the Stone 03 03 03 and its lingering spiciness. Interesting, but it gets thin and the lack of any real head hurts the visual appeal.","Jredner","Mar 04, 2006"
4.2,8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Filled about 2.5 hours ago. Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights at the bottom of the glass. A 2 finger light tan head falls to a quarter inch over top of the beer. Its pretty dark, but clarity is still easy to see. A nice clear brew. Nose is definately rye spicey. This is balanced by a very deep roast, but not overpoweringly strong. There are lighter chocolate notes playing behind the sharper and stronger rye and roast. Flavor is nice. The spicey rye hits initially and stays with through the duration of the taste. This melds very well with a more subtle roasted character, with a sweet caramel and very light chocolate undertone. I think the flavors in this one really work well togther. Nothing is too strong, and I think the balance is done well. The feel is thick, with a light carbonation, giving it a very chewy feel to it. This also works very well with the other characteristics of the brew. I think this beer is very well built. Even though it is a substantial beer, it doesn't sit overly heavy, and nothing keeps me from wanting to put this one away with ease. I dig it. I'd like it to have been a shade darker, but that may just be me.","kmpitz2","Mar 02, 2006"

The aroma is ever so chocolaty with a lot of roasted malt. It reminds me a lot of Bell's Porter's aroma. The upfront taste is of roasted and chocoalte malt, while some spicy rye comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but is perceived as being a bit lighter due to its medium level of carbonation. Overall, this beers seems to me like a cross between a porter and a stout. Nothing in it really stands out, but everything in it works well and I can't help but like it.","KarlHungus","Beers"

First of all, it survived the time well, no off flavors, nice carbonation. Aroma is nice and full, roasted coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and fresh baked bread. Rye is one of my favorite malts and it works well here, adding a spicy edge to the malty stout. Hops are well balanced and go well with the slightly smoky flavor.

3.73,-4.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Virtually black, with cloudy deep garnet perceptible when held to light. Sticky one fingered head leaves sparse lace. Dryish spicy rye hits the nose at first, then is contrasted by dark caramel malt sweetness and mellow chocolate malt. Hints of prune like tartness and cassis provide a dark fruity undertone in aroma. Fairly tame, but pleasant aromawise. Currant laced sweetness at first in flavor is ceded by a melange of candyish chocolate and mellow prune tinged tartness. Non descript malt sweetness both from residual, unfermentable dextrins and caramel malt persists throughout due to the understated hop bitterness. Moderate bodied, with a enjoyably thick, rye induced gluey proteinaceous mouthfeel. Light, tamarind like rye spiciness emerges mid palate and serves to contrast sweetness. Faint earthy hop flavor. Finishes surprisingly dry, with a snap of trace citric tartness. Bell's Rye Stout is flavorful for sure, but was perhaps a touch lacking in depth of malt character. It's reminescent of a Boulder Singletrack Copper ale and Kalamazoo Stout hybrid. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle of this unique and tasty brew.","marc77","0"
4.23,8.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Perfect ebon color, large fizzy brown head. Aroma is richly roasted and spicy, with hints of graininess. Heavy mouthfeel, but smooth on the palate. Sits sturdily in the mouth, leaving a nice, pleasant finish, and an abiding sweetness, with hints of cherry, coming through in the middle. A very satisfactory stout, and an accomplished experiment from Kalamazoo.","feloniousmonk","Dec 25, 2002"
3.41,-12.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very much like the spiced stout minus the spices. Dry, less espresso flavor, flavor seems a bit thin. Can't really say this is their best offering since the thin bitter flavor underneath grows the further into the glass you get.","aracauna","Dec 19, 2002"
3.8,-2.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours nearly black, with brown/amber highlights showing up only under the scrutiny of a bright light. Substantial creamy tan head that slowly breaks up to leave a sparse filmy head and clingy lace. The smell is very sweet with only faint hints of dark, roasted flavors--not what I expected for a stout. Taste seems rather watered-down but is otherwise pleasant. Sweet and light at the start with grains gradually taking over. Relatively light body for this stout gives it a nice mouthfeel and good drinkability as well.","BitteBier","Dec 09, 2002"
4.13,6.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Bell's is liquid crack for Stout lovers like me. This beer pours almost black with a medium thin light brown head. Very little lacing. Nice bittersweet aroma of chocolate and black cherry. Flavor is a smooth blend of roasted coffee and what I am assuming must be rye. Points for pulling off something unique so well.","Dogbrick","Dec 02, 2002"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A tasty little stout, aided in memorablity by the rye. Sessions are possible, as this one never gets too overpowering to enjoy more of.","cokes","Nov 27, 2002"

3.5,-10,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours black opaque with a finger of head. Maltiness and roasted aroma. Taste is of roasted malt. The one thing that seems a bit distinguishing to this beer is a slight sour tangy taste. Rye taste hangs in the background. Well it seems everyone has few words to describe this and I'm no different. It's OK but I don't miss it too much the rest of the year.","mjohn27603","Nov 13, 2002"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours almost black in color, roasted coffee and chocolate aroma, starts sweet with a thick mouthfeel, full bodied sweet with a nice bitter finish, not bad, then agian I like all of Bells stout.","maxpower","Nov 08, 2002"
3.83,-1.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours very dark, almost black and formed a nice light bubbly brown head that subsided quickly and left trace lace.  The aroma was of malt & rye and the flavoer of rye and chocolate.  A silky body and medium finish.  Not as good as their other stout's like expedition and kalamazoo, but not bad.","Wildman","Nov 05, 2002"
3.8,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Opaque, darkest brown aided by lots of floating chunkies.  Poured the beejeezuz out of it to get just a trace of a head.  Sweet aroma, definitely tinged with a rye sense.  Nice mouthfeel, a trace of an oily presence I like in some Stout styles.  Deep roasted flavors, a trace of dark chocolate sense with some spice.  Subtle rye flavor (good for me, love the bread, have problems with Rye Whiskey)...pretty nice beer, what Stout is next, Kalamazoo?","ADR","Jul 28, 2002"
4.25,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Deep and opaque... with a thin tan head and clinging lace.  Aroma of rye, chocolate, and coffee with a touch of sweetness. Assertive aroma that I really enjoy. Flavor begins slightly acidic... some burnt malt, then rye... finishes with a bitterness and sweetness that reminds me of cappuccino.  Medium full body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. This is a finely created brew from the masters of stouts.  It's brews like this that make me happy to drink local!","zerk","Jun 14, 2002"
4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The Rye Stout is a good looking, almost opaque stout with a substantial amount of yeast floating throughout. It had minimal head that disappeared quickly. The nose was of roasted malt and rye. The taste was the same and was rather easy to drink. Kalamazoo is one of my all-time favorite breweries and it certainly knows how to craft good stouts. This one did not disappoint.","Jon","Mar 23, 2002"
3.83,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Deep, dark brown body with a big tan head.  Head retention is a bit weak, but a clinging lace lasts the life of the beer.  Rye really stands out in the smell, perhaps too much.  Flavor full of rich roasted malt with chocolate.  Rye also stands out in the flavor, but not nearly as strong as in the smell.  The brew feels great on the tongue - just thick and oily enough for a solid stout.  Certainly not the best of Bell's stouts, but still better than many other stouts on the market.  Rye is also an interesting change up for those with stout-heavy diets.","Viking","Dec 11, 2001"
4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Nice opaque appearance with some yeast sediment noticeable.  Thick brown head that is a bit fizzy.  It disappears quickly.  Smells of oats to me.  Very inviting aroma.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  A slight spiciness is present, presumably from the rye.  Medium body.  Just a little viscous but not overbearing.  At times, I think it tastes a bit like a chocolate candy bar.  But I don't get that in every taste.  Not overly bitter.  Easy drinking.  Quality Stout.","Bighuge","Dec 11, 2001"
4.66,19.8,5,4,5,4,5,"-This is a beautiful stout...nice subtle cocoa aroma with grains present...just a wonderful sweet-style stout that isn't overly thick or overly sweet...nice character..unique hop bite on aftertaste..very well made stout by the stout king.","ZAP","Beers"
