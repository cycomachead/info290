The aroma is big bourbon goodness. It doesn't have the vanilla or oaky but the bourbon sweetness. There is also a little dark roasted malt in the background. The taste isn't quite as robust, but both the aroma qualities are present. It almost tastes as though someone dropped a shot in the beer (which isn't a bad thing) but the two flavors don't meld a seamlessly as other barrel-aged beers. The body is lighter in weight as well, not as thick or oily. Just short of great.","delta490","Feb 10, 2015"

Taste: Is a really nice roasted chocolate with bitter caramel and vanilla. Dark chocolate covered coconut. Feel: light body, watery, bitterness hangs around a lil bit. overall: this is not your typical BBS it is 6.5% which is cool because you could drink the whole bottle. It is not overly sweet and heavy. It has the complexity of your typical bourbon barrel beer which is pretty awesome.

The beer is delicious but when you put something in the name it leads the consumer to expect it. I did get a little bit of vanilla but no Bourbon notes, so maybe it did do some time in some oak.

Not as much alcohol as I expected from a Turkey-barrel-aged beer so it lacks a little of the typical warmth but I don't really miss it here.  It is an exceedingly pleasant brew that I feel would be a great introduction to the breed.  It is not the heavier, fuller bodied, more potent example I can sip on for an entire football game but it can be nursed for a really good half!  As a matter of fact, buy 2 and make it a full game you can enjoy win or lose.  Perfect for the cool winter evenings of the South since it isn't quite as heavy as expected.  Worthy of a purchase for sure.","skylab","Dec 14, 2014"

Really great flavor combination and the bourbon is used in a way that isn't overpowering, but really compliments the chocolate, toffee, caramel mix. Under 7% alcohol as well so this is an incredibly sessionable beer that won't weigh you down like traditional Imperial Stouts or BB Stouts. Very impressed.","Jaysauras","Nov 06, 2014"

4.15,9.8,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Not real often you come across a barrel aged stout that's comes in under 7% abv but carries this much flavor and mouthfeel! I love it. Not a huge wild turkey fan myself, and the specific character of the whiskey comes through a lot in this beer, but it seems to work. Frothy look, soft grayish brown head on a dark chocolate colored body with good viscosity and so e clinging density. Nose is whiskey first, thin vanilla and booze, with sweet oak, milk chocolate, and derived fruit, maybe raisin leading the way in the flavor. Oats might froth this up a little, chocolate malt is robust, and the oak is long lasting in the finish. It's great because all the booze and body of the huge imperials is here, right there to enjoy from first sip, but it never gets hit and heavy, allowing me to consume way more of this than I could some imperial. Props to Anderson valley for putting this one together, it's perfect this time of year! A touch of acidity in the finish is my only complaint","StonedTrippin","Nov 01, 2014"

3.06,-19,3.75,3.25,3,3,2.75,"Overall I thought this beer was ok at best and I thought it was a very average example of a Bourbon Barrel aged Stout, the stout base was thin, watery and not to flavorful and it got overpowered by the bourbon.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, crisp, a little watery, not filling and the taste couldn't hold my attention, one glass was more than enough for me, a whole bottle would be too much.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, I thought it was a pretty nice looking beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, it wasn't good and the stout base needed to be beefed up a little to balance out all those boozy bourbon flavors.  I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it, I just don't think it's a good example of the style.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and in the end it left me wanting a lot more out of the stout base, I thought it was odd that a beer under 7% feltso boozy.  So far this is now my least favorite beer from Anderson valley and it's on the lower end of the scale as far as the style goes.  I appreciate the effort, but this beer needs some work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Oct 20, 2014"

Aroma is not particularly roasty, hoppy, or otherwise beery, but is distinctly of oaky bourbon.  Flavor is like sipping fine bourbon.  Creamy, smooth, low alcohol / zero burn bourbon.  As a stout, this is pretty unremarkable, and fulfills the requirement perfunctorily with the right color.  But as a vehicle for sweet vanilla oak barrel flavor, this is quite a lot of fun.","hreb","Beers"

Awesome chocolate foam and a thick, wonderful mouthfeel to this, but it really lets me down as far as "bourbon barrel stouts" go.

At first I was kind of dismissive because there are a lot of these Bourbon Barrel Stouts showing up and i just logged it away with another one trick pony like some of the rest. So I visited a few other tables and then found myself standing back in front of this display, so I gave in. The nose was all Wild Turkey, that sweet, warm, toasty smell. I fully prepared myself for the same on the palate and was so delighted to have this delicious, delightfully bitter stout greet my taste buds. the finish is long and that is where the Wild Turkey showed up again. I am usually more open minded to beer and I immediately kicked myself for initially passing this one over.

However, certainly fails when held to the high standards of other barrel-aged stouts out there. Worth a try for sure, and a good option if you're at a bar with limited choices on tap.

3.8,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer is deceptive in many ways as it looks like it’s going to be this bad ass stout with a Wild Turkey kick, but then it hits you like a pillow, with soft complex flavors that come through a very light body and highlight the bourbon complexities without being obnoxiously in your face and overpowering. My friend Chris told me this was a great beer and he suggested that I try it, and I must say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was much easier to drink than I expected and the low ABV to me added to the overall experience and made this a very solid brew.","CHickman","Jul 10, 2014"

When I say dominated I mean it. I had trouble pulling any other tastes from this brew. The smell however was really nice with chocolate,brown sugar, toffee, and maybe a hint of mocha. The taste just really let me down with how one dimentional it was. Beer tastes stronger than the listed alcohol content of 6.3%.Not a great beer IMO, but not horrible either. Don't plan to buy again. Do have a Anderson Bourbon Barrel Amber that I hope wil be better.","dutesanch","Jun 10, 2014"

All these flavors are stretched thin in the taste: here there is relatively little malt presence. It's bourbon forward with a dry cocoa powder and vanilla flavor.

Unusually thin with perhaps slightly too much bitterness in the finish for its lack of more intense flavors. Nothing in particular stands out to make you say "wow". I'm relatively new to this type of beer but perhaps have been spoiled by higher rated ones. It's a beer I'd recommend trying for the sake of trying it (after all, it's subjective) but nothing to rave about. Not a bourbon stout that improves as it warms. I felt as though I needed to drink the full glass before it warmed , vs other beers in this category which improved as they warmed and breathed and literally lasted 1-2 hrs for 12 oz. Other bourbon stouts seem to encourage continual tastes to decipher the full complexity of the beer, whereas this seems like a stout one would drink for the sake of drinking a stout while attention is aimed elsewhere.

Lighter body characteristics, solid stout flavor, and minor bourbon hints make it extremely sessionable stout. I should have gone back today for another. Recommended.","Gusmotel","Oct 30, 2013"

Smooth spiciness, sweet caramel cream, thought the stout portion comes off a bit light bodied and seems a bit underweight per class like a feather weight boxer to a heavy weight. This is not going to be your typical huge BA stout to the likes of dark lord, Black hole, insert any other BA stout to your liking here, rather this seems like an easy and sweet milk stout with gentle burbon highlights perfect for that causual drinking in multiples despite its 6.9%abv which seems perfect here. I really enjoyed the gentle and sweet drinking nature it had to offer, showing not every BA stout has to be a malt monster and soaked with alcohol, this does nicely as a causual drinker and something i would consider multiples in with good company.","beerthulhu","Oct 24, 2013"

The liquid is a thick, impenetrable black, vague tint of yellow at the rims and surface, you can see a few tiny bubbles here and there. The bourbon comes through easily in the nose, caramel, vanilla and butter, light plum fruit with a vestige of prune but it mostly surprises you for the lack of anything happening, no real roastiness, no hops, just the sweet oak and some fruit and chocolate. Medium-bodied, creamy and soft, the carbonation is moderate and makes things even fluffier. Does have some tingle, maybe from the barrel toast yet still not close to full on roast/toast. Cola, vanilla, chocolate, at many times tastes like Dr. Pepper’s. The lack of body evident through the finish as it trails off, can’t say it is trying to end cleanly. The barrel treatment much more evident in the nose. You don’t get much fruitiness here, notch up of nuttiness. You keep waiting for it to kick in and it really never does.","farrago","Sep 22, 2013"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and barrel character; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, toffee, light oak, light bourbon, vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, toffee, light oak, light bourbon, vanilla, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of roasted/bready malts with a light barrel presence; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good barrel aged stout. Nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with a light barrel presence; and very smooth to drink.

It's meh, it's almost OK, but it's not at all memorable. It's mild and round and has no real distinguishing character except for a bit of wood taste which isn't particularly good. It is lacking in substance and almost tastes diluted. Almost has a touch of that taste from the bottom of a glass of cola with ice when the cola has been watered down by all of the melted ice. And it's a diet cola at that. And I think that's actually the bourbon taste trying to come through, which doesn't speak well for the bourbon. It has kind of a cheap taste, yet costs plenty. Smells decent, with a nice chocolate frosting note. Smooth. It would be interesting to know what they were going for with this beer. Would not by again. Would not recommend. Needs to go back to the drawing board.","BrownNut","Jul 08, 2013"

3.94,4.2,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"I love Anderson Valley's canned oatmeal stout so when I saw they did a barrel aged stout I was sold. Pours pitch black into my chalice with at least four fingers of tan head, even spread lacing. I like how they kept the abv pretty modest compared to some of the other bourbon barrel aged beers. The nose is beautiful a kiss of bourbon amongst a nice creamy dark chocolate back drop, hints of vanilla and charred oak complement the dark roasted barley in the stout. Flavor develops nicely with each sip expressing more Wild Turkey bourbon characteristics especially the smooth boozy vanilla and charred oak expressions tucked into a glorious dark roasted malt and mild herbal hopped stout, flavors I'm getting are dark chocolate bitter and dry, with a creamy vanilla center it's man candy in the realm of barrel aged stouts. Mouthfeel a bit lighter than expected but the warmth of the whiskey comes through a medium bodied stout mild carbonation albeit natural feeling and smooth going down. Alcohol burns the palate minimally at 6.9% it's a 22 ounce bottle that your liver doesn't mind finishing on it's own. Overall an impressive complex and approachable barrel aged stout I would drink this again and I know it's not too over the top to introduce bud drinking friends who enjoy whiskey. This could convert your friends into craft beer and I can tell it's going to pair great with my AJ Fernandez blended San Lotano Habano Toro cigar I'm about to toast up. Pairing with the San Lotano, the spicy Nicaraugan tobacco goes great with this flavorful stout actually bringing out more whiskey flavors! Leather and oak from the well aged tobacco also complement the flavor profile of this stout, if you try this beer do yourself a favor and pair it with a hand rolled cigar.","WVbeergeek","Jun 18, 2013"

It tastes like roasted/charred malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, coffee, vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon character in both the aroma and taste is light, but still noticeable.

Feel is the lowest part, it's strange how this washes over the palate, flavor changes quickly but isn't enjoyable. Not the most drinkable.

Pours a beautiful dark black color with a medium-large, frothy tan head that disappears rather quickly. A good-lookin beer. Scent is lacking a bit... a little on the light side. Mellow bourbon flavors with sweet chocolate and hints of vanilla. Some nuttiness and dark malt aromas. Hoping the flavors are a bit more aggressive. They sure are! I mean, as aggressive as a 6.9% bourbon barrel aged stout can be. Lovely barrel flavors...definitely pick up the bourbon. Still has the characteristics of an easy-drinking, sessionable stout...but with much more complexity due to barrel aging. Nice coffee flavors with a bit of toffee and vanilla. Somewhat dry, malty finish. Tasty and enjoyable from first sip to the last. Mouthfeel is lacking a bit. Could be more heavy, as this one is light and creamy...almost like Guinness on nitro, but less watery. Drinkability is high. This beer and the bourbon barrel aged nut brown ale I had from Alesmith are part of the beginning of a new craze in craft beer. I really enjoy these low ABV bourbon barrel aged beers, because you get to enjoy a good amount of it without becoming completely intoxicated, yet you obtain those tasty bourbon, vanilla, and oak notes. Win-win. Solid beer. Haven't had the lower ABV draft version, but this one is quite enjoyable.","DovaliHops","Mar 30, 2013"

This stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises whiskey, toasted oak, and dark chocolate. It's pretty simplistic, but pleasant nonetheless. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the oak character is lessened, the whiskey is consequently increased slightly (and it certainly tastes like Turkey at this point), and there is an addition of very light roasted malts and a hint of Guinness-style sourness near the finish. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly fluid feel. Overall, though a bit on the thin side and a touch too heavy with the whiskey at times, this is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. Definitely worth a shot.","TMoney2591","Feb 10, 2013"
