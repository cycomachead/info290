Pours a deep dark almost black with ruby cola tinted highlights with a dark cocoa bean tan head leaving light speckled bands of lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has sweet vinous undertones rounded out with dark chocolate roasts and hints of vanilla bean and a smidge of lactose creaminess rolling in the backend. Flavor has a balanced sweetness with dark chocolate cacao style roasted malts, a dry finish not overtly creamy or sweet compared to other milk (cream) stouts around. Dark Belgianesque chocolate hits with a nutty dark roasted coffee flavor with layered hints of vanilla bean additions peaking through. Mouthfeel has some warming alcohol shows up a bit, which is surprising considering it's only 6.5% abv, lingering bitterness from dark chocolate and herbal hops breaking through just barely. Medium to full bodied with flowing carbonation levels, goes down extremely smooth and easy. Overall a nice change of pace from the regular Fathead's lineup, roasted dark chocolate bitterness intermingles with hints of vanilla bean again thank the beer gods and Matt Cole for having the foresight not to make this a lactose bomb, in fact it's very much balanced and approachable. My cigar pairing for this beer came from Nicaragua Don Pepin Garcia's My Father cigars blended by Pete Johnson of Tatuaje for Janny Garcia: La Duena #2 Belicoso it paired well with the spicy Nicaraguan tobacco and dark tannins of the rich cigar which brought leather, spice, pepper, and black walnuts to the party.","WVbeergeek","Apr 27, 2013"

3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours almost opaque dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, vanilla, toast, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roasted notes and vanilla. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, light coffee, herbal, toast, and light roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, light coffee, and roasted earthines on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of roasted flavor with cocoa and vanilla; with moderate sweetness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice milk stout. Good robustness and balance of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 22, 2013"

4.19,12.3,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, cream/lactose, and a light minerally aroma. It tastes mostly just like the aroma is, like dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, and some minerals. For some reason this brew really reminds me of drinking an oyster stout. And since I like those, it's a good thing in this case. But even then I have no idea why I'm picking that flavor up in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I know I won't have any problems finishing this 6-pack! $10.99 a sixer.","bluejacket74","Mar 15, 2013"
