Standard roasted malt and hint of coffee aroma you would expect, nothing great or special. Flavor is much better with sweet milk chocolate throughout. The coffee and roasted malts add a lot of flavor without being too bitter. Excellent lacing with medium to thick body and light to moderate carbonation. Very drinkable beer. I like coffee heavy beers but there is enough coffee to satisfy coffee lovers but not too much to turn off those who aren't coffee fans.","kylehay2004","Sep 04, 2012"

The aroma is primarily coffee with perhaps a hint of chocolate. The flavor matches the smell, though I find it to be very one-dimensional. The coffee flavor is closer to your generic cup of joe as opposed to any fancy artisinal brew. This lends an ascerbic element to the coffee that I don't particularly enjoy, yet appears all too common in coffee themed beers. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if there were stronger supporting flavors to shoulder the load, but unfortunately bitter black coffee is the only prominent taste. Maybe if you look hard you can find some milk chocolate in there, and a meager dose of hops, but on the whole there is a surprising lack of substance for the style. This isn't a terrible brew in that it is technically drinkable, but there's not much to relish in a thin, bitter, one-dimensional stout.","MaximalC","Apr 14, 2012"

Pours a dark black with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head, leaving a good amount of lacing along the glass. The smell is bitter, chocolatey, sweet; the taste is also bitter, with hints of molasses, caramel, chocolate, and roasted coffee. Towards the end, the flavors dissipate a bit and you're left with basically just the bitterness. Although most like to pair a coffee or oatmeal stout with dessert, I'm more along the lines of pairing these types of stouts (and imperial stouts) with a good burger. I'd have this one again if I was eating a burger, or maybe as an after-dinner brew, but it's definitely a novelty beer imo as opposed to a truly great stout.","oldirtycaffrey","Apr 01, 2012"

Nice bitter chocolate presence but the real show stealer is the amazingly fresh coffee flavor and aroma that upstages everything.

Tastes like a cold glass of coffee, backed by chocolate (from the malt, I assume). Low levels of a nondescript hop bitterness, with some coffee bite shoring it up. The overall picture is kind of weak. It meets its requirements, but there's something missing... All things considered, it's average, and I'll drink the second in the mix pack if the wife doesn't...

Although it has some coffee scents (roasted beans) and some chocolate and grain character, it seems one-dimensional. It's a muted, unassuming smell. It doesn't exactly wake you up. The taste is a bit more redeeming...bitter, highly roasted, nearly burnt flavors. It's a bit astringent, but it is also flavorful. The intense deep roast is good, but could use some balance.

3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours out a black color with a nice frothy, tan head. The smell, like a lot of SA Brews, is kind of underwhelming. There are some detectable coffee notes, along with dark chocolate and liqourice aromas. The flavor is nice and bold with big coffee and chocolate malts battling it out for the predominate flavor. It ends with a nice smokey finish. To be honest, this brew reminds me a bit of Guinness and I don't typically make that comparison. It is just has certain pleasant smokey flavor that is nice to find in a Stout once in a while. The hops provide some bitterness but not a lot in the nose unfortunately. What I really like is how well the coffee blends with the dark malts. I was afraid that I would get a stale coffee taste from the brew and I don't get that at all.

As well, many of the stout flavors seem to be light, as if a medium-grade stout had been amped up with heavy aging. The mouthfeel is also strangely watery for the potency of these initial flavors, creating a distracting contrast. Still, the beer does deliver delicious coffee flavors, and is quite drinkable.

Medium bodied, roast, coffee, chocolate flavors. Sour finish with a touch of hop bitterness to balance the experience. Tastes more like an Irish dry stout. The beer is drinkable, but you should drink it slow to savor the flavor profile. Some might say the beer is "unfocused." It tasted like a porter at first before morphing into a stout and then a black lager. But I think the progression of flavors in intriguing. Not a single-dimensional brew.

4.18,13.9,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good Coffee Stout and a good American Stout. I find that most coffee stouts tend to be bigger and more on the imperial side of the spectrum so I liked the fact that Sam Adams chose to use an American Stout as the base of this beer, there are enough Imperial Coffee Stouts, it nice to have one that is a little lighter with better drinkability. This beer has really good drinkability, some of those coffee stouts are so rich and robust that you really can't have more then one, but with this beer I feel like I could have two or three without being overwhelmed by the flavor. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and the look, this beer looked damn good and the flavor had just enough roast and coffee flavor to it. The only thing I would change would be to make it just a little thicker, but other then that it is pretty spot on. I will for sure be getting the Holiday pack again, with beers like this, chocolate bock, and holiday porter make this the most solid Holiday pack around, I only wish that they would put this in six packs. I recommend this beer to anyone that is a fan of coffee flavors in their beer, this beer should do the trick. I really like this beer, I like to refer to this beer as Breakfast Stout Light, the flavors are pretty similar ir is just in a lighter and more drinkable beer. This is one solid coffee stout and this beer fits in nicely in their holiday pack, good job Sam Adams, I going to miss this beer when the season is over.","StoutHunter","Nov 18, 2011"

3.82,4.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Easily, this is one of the better coffee stouts I have ever had. It's not the easiest style to work with oftentimes. Oftentimes coffee and malt flavors can become disjointed and awkward. This isn't the case with the Black and Brew. The appearance is a nice black with pleasant but fleeting tan head. It smells like coffee, but not just coffee, but with added cream and perhaps a little chocolate too. It's creamy, which is great. It's got a good, sticky mouthfeel that lingers for quite a while (the taste does too). Overall, I'd say this would be the celebrated beer out of the Sam Adams Winter assortment, but that's just me.

This is actually my first coffee beer and while I know theres probably stronger tasting ones out there this one is really a perfect combination of coffee and beer. Not too much coffee where its weird to drink but not too little where you dont taste it. Excellent offering from Samuel Adams.","thebrood1987","Nov 08, 2011"

It pours a brown-tinged obsidian topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild chocolate, and a subtle twinge of coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger coffee contingent, one that comes across nice and smooth, rather than overly bitter or roasted too darkly. Very nice. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a surprisingly very tasty and easy-going coffee stout. 'Nuff said. Get some!","TMoney2591","Nov 08, 2011"

4.06,10.6,5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours an amazing beautiful black with a two and a half inch sticky mocha head, lot's of lacing. Very impressed with the retention. Smell is expresso, chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is all of that with coffee & chocolate to start, with some roasted malts and hints of smoke and vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is great, especially considerin the reasonable abv. Heavy for it's size with plenty of carbonation. A great addition to the winter mix pack, might be the stand out now. Nothing I don't want to drink in this 12 any more, nice work .","SawDog505","Nov 01, 2011"
4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O: Definitely a winner in the line up of Samuel Adams' seasonal 12 pack. I thought that this was a remarkably well blended coffee stout that plain and simple got it right, not frills attached. I would buy a sixer of this were it available","RossCain","Nov 01, 2011"
3.95,7.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This pours a solid flat black, with a generous topping of tan foam. There’s a sharp, delicious aroma of dark chocolates and dark-roasted coffee that comes through. The coffee definitely dominates the flavor. It’s as if I dumped my favorite French roast into a stout recipe. (Stout or porter, I’m not going to enter that debate right now.) This is smartly balanced, with a lingering coffee finish that coats the palate. All around solid brew.","elNopalero","Nov 01, 2011"
3.55,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"M/O-has a real nice body, impressive lacing, down side of this beer is your taste buds get fatigue rather quickly. One is good enough for me in one setting. after that I'm looking for somthing else. Somthing new is always nice. I know alot of us buy the mix pack for the old fezzy wig alone. Nothing wrong with that though! Anyways it's a good beer not great.","beerman21","Nov 01, 2011"

4.1,11.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O: A definite winner from BBC. Fits the season perfectly and isn't so extreme that it will push non-craft drinkers away. Haven't particularly enjoyed some of their new "seasonal" beers (their saison and kolsch in the summer pack tasted too similar and were just decent overall), but this one is a nice exception","BEERMILER12","Oct 31, 2011"
4.33,18,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"2011 Sam Adams holiday samplers offers up this new brew from Jim Koch and company. Appears pitch black no light makes it through when held toward the light. Deep thick mocha tan head forms a dense foam cap with speckled even coated lacing left on the sides of my glass. Aroma is great pure ice brewed coffe roasts, with creamy sweet lactose sugar notes and a caramelized malt presence really makes for a pleasant smell. Creamy dark chocolate/roasted coffee accents works wonderfully together, semi acidic nautre about it from the coffee roasts. Robust coffee flavor in each sip really a well rounded sipping stout, easy to drink but intense with layers of flavor. Caramelized creamy malt sugars and robust Sumatran coffee even has layers of vine ripened fruitiness. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied never thick or hard to bear on the palate, quite the oppposite with velvet texture and smooth carbonation. Overall an excellent source of mainstream coffee beer the way it should be brewed every time, one that highlights the nature of how awesome both coffee and beer can be. Especially as in the symbiotic relationship that Black and Brew provides, just try this one this holiday season.","WVbeergeek","Oct 30, 2011"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A nice stout. Not big but it is flavorful. A good keeper for Sam Adams.","Gmann","Oct 29, 2011"
4.22,15,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A new winner from Sam Adams, this was smooth, tasty and very enjoyable. This brew hid the 5.8% ABV very well, and at first it seemed like a gimmick beer until I got the cap off and then inhaled that wonderful coffee aroma. This beer was a very pleasant surprise and a beer I definitely recommend checking out.","CHickman","Oct 29, 2011"
3.98,8.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall a great beer for a cool day... solid all the way around! I've been increasingly impressed with what BBC is doing with what is pretty much mass-produced beer.","whiplash3825","Oct 29, 2011"
4.38,19.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was highly impressed by this beer especially after having there Chocolate Bock, which was terrible in my opinion. This beer had a very creamy head along with a very creamy taste. The roasted malt characteristics were on point as well as the smooth finish. It could have had a little more hop taste(coming from someone who isn't high on hops) but overall i still give this beer an 8.5 out of 10","bnewall3","Oct 28, 2011"
4.3,17.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: I REALLY like this new offering. Most coffee stouts I have had are higher ABV beers. This is perfect. Balance is the key. Nothing overpowers and this is highly drinkable. A great alternative to the imperial stouts with coffee. A great beer IMHO. I'll certainly stock up on this if it goes to sixers!","Brunite","Oct 28, 2011"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall - I must say i bought the 12 pack winter variety just to try this beer and i am really glad i did, i was really kind of surprised at the quality of this one. Very coffee forward but does not dismiss the great qualities of a stout, chocolates and roasted malts. Very nice, i am impressed!","aorloski","Oct 27, 2011"
4.11,12,5,4,4,4.5,4,"O-i'm fairly impressed with this stout. Its one of the most full flavored American stouts that i've had. it shows how good and fairly intense flavor can come from a lower ABV. it does seems to lose some of its luster as the drink goes on.","AdamBear","Oct 26, 2011"
3.62,-1.4,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"O: Definitely a nice winter-type drink. There's a lot more coffee character than any stout I've ever had before. It's not really a bad thing at all...it's just...strange. I guess you don't how much it tastes like coffee unless you try it. If you're not a fan of coffee, avoid this one; you won't like it. Otherwise, it's a quality, albeit interesting, stout. Definitely worth picking up, especially since it comes packaged with some other great brews.","TTAmod","Oct 25, 2011"
4.03,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"M/O: This beer is a good representation of the style. Not too overpowering and not too sweet.","pzrhsau","Oct 23, 2011"
3.75,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall I found this one to be very drinkable. Normally beers like this are a bit to bitter for my taste, but this one gives me a bit of sweet combined with a nice coffee flavor, minus the bitterness. Definitely worth checking out.","Vixie","Oct 21, 2011"
