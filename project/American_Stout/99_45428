There is a slightly bitter and acidic roast flavor that lingers on the palate after each sip. Not very good in this regard.

3.47,2.4,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"D: A very solid beer. Definitely good for desserts. I wouldn't have more than one, though, due to the bitterness.","dananabanana","Dec 23, 2008"
3.68,8.6,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"12oz bottle poured into glass. Very dark black color with foamy brownish head. Only a slight amount of light gets through the beer. Head turns rockier as it slowly dissipates. Cannot pick up much aroma besides the hints of vanilla. Also hints of malts. Good taste, strong chocolate malts present, caramel tastes also. Of course vanilla. Not much carbonation, full body. Overall a great new beer from Saranac, has some room to improve but still something to sit back in the winter and enjoy.","CloudStrife","Dec 21, 2008"
3.53,4.1,3,2.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Despite being a stout, this is very drinkable without being watery. The lack of an astringent alcohol note is very nice as well. This is a must-try.","Vendetta","Dec 20, 2008"

4.03,18.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Longneck poured into a Harpoon Munich Dark glass. Big, tightly-packed light tan head atop a ruby-tinged black liquid. Large dimples form as the head settles down with excellent stick and retention. Roasty aroma with a touch of vanilla. Clean malt profile to start with a bit of vanilla sweetness. Hops join in just to balance, and the beer ends with a dry, almost acrid roasty malt character. Feel is medium-light and dry with lively carbonation. Coffee drinkers will find this beer pleasing and easy to drink. This beer came off as very Dry Irish in character to me with a hint of vanilla to it. I was expecting a much heavier feel and more pronounced vanilla flavor. Overall, a nice stout and welcome addition to the winter 12-pack.","kkosmoski","Dec 19, 2008"
3.95,16.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The heavy roasted malt flavors rule the taste here from beginning to end, seeming very reminiscent of an Irish stout with hints of oatmeal. There is caramel and a touch of coffee in the aftertaste. The texture could stand some thickening. Overall, this is drinkable and fine but not quite a top notch stout.","daliandragon","Dec 14, 2008"

I definetley don't remember the dark roasty ester taste in the finish, but now that I'm having it again it is such an inviting, warming brew. This one is probably the favorite out of the Saranac Winter pack, a good blend of vanilla without going out of control, and now that it taste a tad stronger it's a bigger winner in my book. An excellent job from Matt Brewing.","thespaceman","Dec 06, 2008"

The taste isn't as sweet as expected, but still there. A nice malty vanilla flavor with some odd notes in the aftertaste. A decent mouthfeel, nice carbonation, not as heavy as expected, but still somewhat full bodied. This one is an ok drinker, the flavor could get to you but is a nice stout worth checking out.","wingman14","Nov 26, 2008"
3.63,7.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Brew poured to a deep black color with a good thick medium tan colored head that has very good retention and has left a great deal of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma comes off a slightly tinged with an burnt astringency. The vanilla is very faint in the nose, I am not sure if I am really picking it up but it might be sweet aroma that is sneaking through. The flavor is good though it breaks to a harsh bitterness that I believe would be from the heavy roasted is not burnt malts. Also has some chocolate and coffee overtones with the chocolate lingering at the back of the mouth. Overall this is a pretty good stout, again a good addition to this years christmas beer line up. Quite easy drinking though the burnt astringency would get to me after 2 or 3. The carbonation is good but the body seems to be a little watery.","Stimack","Nov 25, 2008"

3.77,11.2,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Appears an opaque black with ruby highlights around the edges when held up to the light. Head forms thick with a rising biscuit appearance, lacing is fine but even all around my imperial pint. Aroma has some pleasant vanilla extract it's not overpowering or alcholic in nature with coffee and dark chocolate tones as well. A dry powdered doughnut sweetness is there with a touch of herbal hop tones. Flavor is okay too much dry dark chocolate bitterness flowing around with watery coffee mix and semi burnt sugar glazed with vanilla extract, light on alcohol and herbal hops. Fuller bodied for a Saranac offering but for a stout it's a bit thin, carbonation is on and drinkability due to the nice abv brings on a level of sessionability. A solid offering that will keep stout fans excited it's still nice to see these big breweries pulling of craft styles especially beloved regionals like FX Matt and High Falls.","WVbeergeek","Nov 24, 2008"

It goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter with hints of vanilla. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average stout, but it's nothing to get excited about.","WesWes","Nov 19, 2008"

3.31,-2.4,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Smells like a watered down vanilla late from McDonald's. Tastes like one too. The roasted malt and strong coffee flavors one usually associates with stouts isn't here. It's just a mild maltiness followed by a heavy vanilla with some hop attachment. Not a bad beer, but nothing special.","donkeyrunner","Nov 18, 2008"
3.74,10.3,4,3,4,3.75,4,"I loved this beer. This stout is scary drinkable with just a touch of vanilla so you know it's there but it isn't enough to drink like a vanilla soda. Is super smooth and the body is great. Low in ABV so it doesn't knock you down and could use more in smell but other than that it's a terrific beer.","oriolesfan4","Nov 16, 2008"
3.13,-7.7,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Pours nice and black with tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is of vanilla with some dark malts receding in the background and a nice contribution from the hops which is good to see in an American stout. Taste is pretty astringent with a lot of flavor coming from the vanilla. It has a soda-like character and a lot of the roasted malt flavor is compromised by the astringency. Mouthfeel is light for a stout but not unpleasant. Easy to drink but I don't think this is too great of a beer.","wiseguy142","Nov 15, 2008"

3.23,-4.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This beer poured an opaque dark brown with a big fluffy two-finger head. The smell is surprisingly more stout than vanilla with some toasty malt and coffee with a little vanilla. The taste starts off with some bittersweet chocolate and a little coffee that gives way to some hops with just a tiny bit of vanilla in the background. The mouthfeel is has a little thickness with some fine-bubbled carbonation. I wouldn't consider this beer to be too drinkable, but about average for a stout.","TheTrevor","Oct 30, 2008"
3.53,4.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nearly black with a three finger tan head that slowly dies down to a creamy layer of foam. Spotty spiderweb type lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of roasted grains, wet cardboard, and some chocoalte malts. The vanilla is very subdued in the nose which is good because Saranac has been known to go a bit over the top with flavored beers. Taste is very smokey, much more than I had anticipated. Charred grains, roasted barley, and dark chocolate malts up front with a slight vanilla extract sweetness. Earthy hops and dirty oak midway on the tongue with a fairly dry coffee grind aftertaste. Harsh bitter feel with a medium body and mild carbonation. This doesn't have the explosion of flavoring like the caramel porter which is nice. The vanilla is there, but in check for the most part. Not bad, could be borderline session beer for some at 4.8% abv.","BeerTruth","Oct 26, 2008"
