The nose is a bouquet of coffee shop aromas including coffee beans, vanilla, chocolate, cream, and roasted grains and malts. Coffee comes through big on the taste with a bitterness that is attenuated by a sweetness from unfermented sugars. I also get some milk chocolate and a nutty character.

The mouthfeel is quite good, very smooth and full bodied.  I had this beer for the first time fresh and only thought it was ok, now having a bottle with over a year on it has really helped it to fill out.  It seems to have become much more smooth and rich, especially in the mouth feel.  I'm changing my rating from a 3.5 to 4.25.  I'm going to have to go find some more to stash away for a year or so.","TooGood","Mar 15, 2014"

The tobacco notes are stronger in the taste, and not as smokey. However, I don't think the taste itself is far off, but I was hoping for more body in the feel. The beer feels a bit light on the tongue, although the tobacco and bitter coffee tastes do cling to the mouth in a mildly oily way.","cjgiant","Mar 15, 2014"

Taste is all coffee, all day... some chocolate and vanilla but coffee dominant. Moderate mouthfeel which suits the flavor appropriately - not too heavy, not too thin.. just right. I love coffee stouts so this beer is amazing and am actually surprised it doesn't have higher review scores. Seek it out if you haven't already tried it, another great Bell's offering.","mrjmann","Mar 11, 2014"

At a decently high 7.5% ABV, the alcohol burn is non-existant, making this one hell of a fun ride for both coffee stout newbies and veterans who are looking for an easy to drink one. Only real complaint is it's expensive at roughly $14.99 a 6 pack, the value compared to Founder's Breakfast Stout isn't quite as great.

It pours smooth and dark with very little foam, which is a nice deep brown. It smells like drinking a beer in a coffee bar and tastes like a nice chilled cup of dark roast coffee. It leaves your pallet clean without a bitter aftertaste and leaves you wanting for more. A great coffee stout.","AUGRAD06","Jan 17, 2014"

It’s just so easy to drink and so approachable for having such good, full, rich flavor and feel. Honestly, this is an underrated beer, without a doubt, and I will most likely be seeking this out again in the future.","fmccormi","Jan 08, 2014"

The taste is also strong on the coffee, almost too much so. I love strong coffee so I enjoy the flavor, but I would prefer it be balanced with something else. The mouthfeel is thick with a lingering coffee bitterness. Overall a good coffee beer that I'd like to see with some additional flavors, like chocolate, smoked malt, or barrel aging.","mc4z","Dec 27, 2013"

A heavier texture and additional malt sweetness (higher malt bill/flaked oats) would improve this beer from very good to outstanding. The coffee needs balanced with sweetness. To taste what I'm talking about, pour a half and half of Java and Expedition - the result is an OUTSTANDING coffee stout.","tillmac62","Oct 09, 2013"

Aromas of big roasted coffee beans, espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, caramel, and light herbal. Damn nice aromas with big coffee presence and nice background malt balance. Taste of big roasted coffee, dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, light char, toffee, caramel, and light herbal hops. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, caramel, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity with plenty of coffee flavor; very nice malt/bitterness balance; zero cloying flavors noticed after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

Smells like an aged Russian imperial stout. In the flavor, roasted malts, black acidic coffee and a touch of dark soy sauce. As it warms some vanilla notes come out and the firm maltyness takes over. Cocoa nibs, black coffee , smoky malts and alcohol make up the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is full bodied, well carbonated and smooth. Overall, this coffee stout is pretty good at about a year old, but since its coffee bill is so strong I recommend consuming it fresh , the flavors don't really improve with age.","Stinkypuss","Nov 13, 2012"

Solid lacing and retention. Smell is roasted malt and black coffee. Taste is roasted malts, light salty smoke and smooth coffee. Its not a dark roast, or an espresso. Its just a basic, run of the mill black coffee. Very light bitterness, finishes cleanly with lingering coffee notes. Its simplistic, but very effective. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth.

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Thanks to EgadBananas for this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a two finger length, creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. Some ruby red can be seen along the edges of the glass. Some sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, strong coffee, and mild chocolate. It smells sweet. The taste follows the nose. There are strong flavors of coffee and roasted barley malt. There's chocolate and molasses. The flavors are full and robust. The alcohol is not present in the flavor. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and creamy. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer. While the body is on the lower end for imperial stouts, this is by no means a point against this beer.

If you're expecting a regular American stout with a strong coffee flavor, you'll won't be disappointed. This beer is actually quite sessionable.

Poured from bottle to a pint glass the beer is dark black with brown edges in the light with a decent 1 finger mocha colored head has decent retention and lacing. The nose is coffee dominated. Behind the coffee is roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and just enough alcohol warmth to remind you this is an Imperial. Similarly the flavor is dominated by coffee from start to finish. The roast, chocolate, and mild bitterness play 2nd fiddle but also provide a nice flavor. Full bodied and well carbonated. Finishes dry with a lingering coffee flavor. Overall, this was a treat. A bit too aggressive with the coffee, in my opinion, but still good!","hopfacebrew","Apr 30, 2012"
3.61,-8.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from bottle into snifter at a good temp. Very nice looking beer. Rich deep brown pour with a nice 2+ finger mocca head. Adequate spotting and decent lacing throughout. Head faded pretty quick. Nose is huge coffee upfront and a hint of burnt toast/malts on the finish. A bit of a stale old coffee smell which was distracting. Taste follows the nose with that heavy coffee punch initially and then fading to some butterscotch and dark fruits. Not a huge fan of the big coffee stouts, but this was not too over the top. Burnt taste on the end. Decent hop/malt mix. Feel was nice and creamy. Not too thick, but plenty enough carbonation to get at the tongue. Overall- A nice take on the java/coffee stout style. A little too much burnt/stale coffee for me, but not a bad beer.

Pure, strong, espresso and dark roast coffee beans. Coffee tails off in the flavor, but still pronounced and stronge roasted coffee notes...not a sweet coffee like many other coffee flavored beers, but a black, espresso vibe. Nice milk chocolate sweetness to kill some of the bittering coffee at the finish. This is a beer for coffee lovers, not lovers of coffee flavored things. I can see how it might be off-putting to some, and has a one-note flavor profile, but there is definitely room for this coffee specialty stout.","uustal","Feb 19, 2012"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Finally getting down to re-trying this guy and putting my thoughts to words. Posterity? Maybe... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown with very deep ruby highlights, all topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose is primarily a playground for nutty coffee, though a touch of roast vainly attempts to peek through the bean-y fog. The taste continues this trend, though the roast, still relatively faint, stands a bit stronger than it once did (nasally speaking). The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a one-trick pony that has honed his trick decidedly well. Not necessarily top-tier, but close to it.","TMoney2591","Jan 29, 2012"

The nose is coffee and milk chocolate. Taste is big coffee up front followed by silky milk chocolate and a mildly roasty malt profile. More coffee in the finish, which is dry with a slight diactyl aftertaste. Feel is somewhat full bodied with a low but appropriate level of carbonation. A nice example of a coffee stout. Perhaps not as complex as some others, but a solid offering nonetheless. Glad I had the opportunity.","Sideswipe","Nov 03, 2011"

Although I generally like beers, I had no idea as to just how strong the java flavor of this one would be. I generally like milk and sugar with my coffee, admittedly, but I can tolerate coffee black from time to time. The Bell's Java Stout, however, has a stronger coffee flavor than coffee itself!

The smell of the beer had a good amount of coffee on the nose. The coffee was probably the entire aroma that this beer had in my opinion other than the roasted malts. The taste of the beer wasnt too bad but I felt that the coffee flavors were a little weak when comparing the nose. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry. Overall this beer was pretty good, I'd drink it again.","Knapp85","Jul 19, 2011"

4.36,10.9,2.5,4,5,3.5,4.5,"O: I really enjoyed this one. I tend to like beers that go along with their genre with maybe a little something extra and though this wouldn't necessarily be a go to beer, it was overall excellent.","kylehay2004","Jun 30, 2011"
4.84,23.2,4,5,5,5,4.5,"My pour was even more impressive in its result than Bell's Extra Special Stout (the last one I reviewed prior to this)! Two dense fingers of deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was an ebony black, allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was REALLY roasty, reminding me why I shied away from it lo, those many years ago. It was somewhere between Colombian and French Roast in its roastiness and both of those are still ones that I add to a simple Original Blend. Either one on their own and I could be hooked up to a generator for the day. That is to give you an idea of intensity, on top of which, we are talking 7.5% ABV. This is not a beer for the faint of heart! Mouthfeel was unbelievably full and creamy and one of us had mellowed in terms of taste. Either it had come down or I have elevated or perhaps both, but it was still pretty intense in terms of its dark-roasted coffee flavor and the difference was that I found it very enjoyable. I think that I was really on a hops kick back then and this just did not taste "right" to me at the time. The lacing that was beginning to appear looked like it would take a jackhammer to remove later. Finish was like finishing a demitasse of cappuccino. I kid you not, you had really better like intense coffee, not just simply a cuppa joe or this is not going to be your cup of tea, so to speak. Oh, my heart ...","woodychandler","Jun 26, 2011"

The smell is almost all coffee: roasted beans, burnt grinds and cold coffee. There is also a little stout aroma in there: dark fruits, some almond and roasted malts. The flavor just accentuates all of these aromas. Espresso, black coffee, roasted malts, some leather, but also a bit of cinnamon and a vague sweetness. The coffee flavor is very strong, but not necessarily the best coffee flavor that I've had in a coffee stout: it tastes a bit like old, cold coffee. The finish is pretty mild with a faint roasted bitterness. However the aftertaste is really nice and creates some nice eructations.

But the coffee is slightly off tasting as if the pot sat out a bit too long and oxidized. As the beer warmed the malt and a bit of chocolte barely make their way into the flavor but still mostly slightly stale coffee. The mouthfeel was solid and not overly thick. This is one stout that I could probably have 2 and not be overwhelmed by - I just don't know if I'd want that much coffee flavor (especially when it just seems to have a little missing in the flavor).","plumcrazyfx","Nov 14, 2010"

It is quite nice, now for the taste....wow, big espresso middle, with some dark roasted chocolate malts and bitter oily aftertaste. The taste of this beer lingers on the palate for quite a long time, like a rich demitasse of espresso. I would rate the mouthfeel as being exactly as it should be, but the rich oilyness affects drinkability a little bit. Overall it is a quite nice although I am thankful it is available in singles at my local liquor store. I could imagine this beer would be a bit much in a full six pack, would take me a while to drink all of them, but would be great sitting in the back of the fridge aging a little.

Chocolate notes are present near the finish and are very nice. Also, there is a hint of sweetness in there somewhere. There is a nice mouthfeel on this beer. Its nice and creamy with a heavier body on it, but deinitely not the heaviest one of the style by any means. Decent carbonation on this beer as well. This was a really drinkable stout.

Lacing and head retention are both decent, but overall I've seen a few more impressive looking stouts. Bell's Java Stout has one of the best/most potent aromas I've found on a beer in a long time. After pouring I could smell the coffee from halfway across the room (and we're talking a pretty good sized room to boot). Further olfactory inspection leads to the discovery of a fair amount of dark chocolate sweetness, though rich coffee is definitely still in the driver's seat. Each sip brings exactly what the nose promised, a healthy dose of coffee with dark chocolate making some noise in the background. I'd like to see a little bit more going on before I give it a better score, a dash of caramel, a hint of fruits, just something beyound the coffee/chocolate. I also am picking up on a little bit of a harsh bitterness, it feels like maybe Bell's extracted some unwanted flavors when adding coffee to Java Stout. Not to the point of being a real nuisance, but definitely noticeable. Carbonation is on the low side, but definitely still present. Perfectly suited for the style. Java Stout is impressively rich for a stout of relatively small size, very creamy. Java Stout is another very good offering from Bell's, up there with Terrapin's Coffee Oatmeal Stout and FBS as one of the best coffee stouts around today.","axeman9182","Oct 20, 2010"

The smell is aggressive and rich with well roasted coffee beans...like a great cup of coffee, then it pans out some and it leaves you with a bitter nose.

The roasted bitterness is present but restrained and balanced to perfection with the hop bitterness. Light-bodied with a good carbonation and a nice mouth-coating malt presence. Definitely one of the best coffee stouts I've had. I'm not usually a huge fan of the style but I could definitely see myself having this one again.

Just for the smell alone I'm curious in letting this warm-up before I post the review, but I may just go back and update if it makes a noteworthy difference. This tastes so much like the Breakfast Stout, just lacking some of the punch and other ingredients. The coffee flavors are overtly noticeable, balanced well with a hint of caramel and chocolate and roasted malts round out the experience. It's such a balanced and great flavor that - like Founder's Breakfast Stout - I find hard to put down, I just enjoy constantly sipping this.

Flavor is dominated by espresso, dark roasted coffee beans, bitter cocoa, bakers chocolate, a bit smokey, milk/cream, and bitter grassy hops.

The coffee flavor is still strong with a highly roasted/almost burnt taste. There's a bit of chocolate, but there's an even stronger stogie character. In fact, after drinking more than one bottle on a recent evening, I woke up the next morning with an uncanny "tastes just like I smoked a cigar last night flavor" burned into my tongue from this new batch. Weird...I wasn't expecting that! I like this fresh version, but I miss the previous "aged" and more mellow version. If the new version is anything like the last one, it will improve over the next year and develop a tasty cocoa flavor. The last version was quite good at around a year or so, but then went south in a hurry. Overall, I'm just not as excited about the new version, but hopefully it'll improve with a little age.","ohmybock","May 01, 2009"

The smell is coffee and dark chocolate, complex and simple at the same time. The taste is surprisingly what you would expect. Carbonation is low. It is incredibly accurate in strong coffee taste. There is a slight acidity to it and a flavor that is smoky but not burnt. Dark chocolate flavors linger as well. Not only that, but you get the roasted malts too. My wife thought it was too strong, but I liked it very much. The body is thick and full. It is smooth, though it snaps just a little. This one also has good texture and a nice balance of flavors. If you're looking for a good coffee stout, this is one to try.","Brenden","Feb 24, 2009"

Funny, it almost looks like coffee when I pour it in a pint to make ice coffee, so that bodes well for the title. The smell most definitely reinforces that look. It reeks of dark roasted coffee and a strong malt backbone. All of these senses dictate the taste, dark roasted coffee, hints of chocolate, and strong malt character. It is a tasty stout, indeed. The taste is incredible, although, its little light in consistency, I could have another, but this one stands well on its own.

This stout is packed full of java! I also get some bitter chocolate, some raisinets, and maybe a hint of toffee, but mainly just good, strong coffee. This beer pours a very dark brown, with some nice tan head at the start, but unfortunately the head seems to dissipate a little early. The taste is (as you would guess) very dominated by coffee. I wouldn't say this is the most well balanced beer I've had, but if you're really in the mood for a strong coffee stout, you won't mind that fact. There is a bit of astringency in this one, probably due to the fact that it is so loaded with coffee. I don't know if I could drink a lot of these, but I would definitely enjoy 1 or 2. I think that if you are big on coffee stouts, then this is one to try. It is certainly rich and full of the bean! An interesting specialty brew for sure!","sudsface69","Dec 18, 2008"

Choked down about half the batch and ended up dumping the rest, just too many coffee beans used. This one is much smoother and tastier, but still not to my expected liking. Aroma is intriguing, lots of ground coffee bean to the nose but with a decent amount of dark malt to make it enjoyable. Dark pour, head soon diminishes, and no lacing very sub-par for a stout. Thin mouthfeel even a touch watery, happens more often than I allow myself to admit w/ Bell's beers. Flavor is a solid blend of dark and roated malt with a ton of coffee, again just too much focus on the bean it really detracts from the decency of a good stout.

THe taste felt roasty, a tad sour, with only the slightest bit of coffee to me, although others in the group described it as being very heavy on coffee.

As expected, it had a bitter coffee aftertaste but it wasn't too strong.

The coffee flavors are subtle at first, and then all of a sudden they just take control of the palate. Mouthfeel is very smooth and flavorful. The palate is very complex, yet subtle.

Strong nose of roasted coffee and lots of it, but something else as well. If I had to describe it the secondary smell was a combination of something vegetal and dirt or sour coffee grounds.

At first, the intensity was enjoyable, but the alcohol and bitterness began to wear on my senses. The body was uber-thick, viscous, and brought on a bitter, alcohol and coffee finish. Carbonation was almost non-existant. I imagine that if you poured a Dark Lord into a pint of Guiness, you'd end up with something close to Bell's Java Stout: thick & creamy, with an assault from the malts.

Fresh roasted coffee grounds that aren't as big as from the bottle. Chocolate plays a bigger role and also a hint of oatmeal. Also the bitter finish isn't there like it is in a bottle. Unbelievable.

This is one I'll definitely pick up again.","becktone","Nov 30, 2007"

What makes it unique is the strength of the coffee flavoring as it does not hold back to have a strong, black coffee ground taste that begins with each sip and remains well after finishing.

Sweet malt bomb with flavors of chocolate, caramel, and espresso. Starts and finishes extremely smooth with a good hop bite mixed up there in the middle.

Not over the top, just beautifully balanced, and tastes like fresh brewed coffeee, not coffee grounds. Terrapin, take notes! Pours bloack with a thin dark tan head that fades quickly. Smell is fresh ground coffee beans up front, followed by subtle notes of vanilla, cherry, raspberry, cream, and some faint bitterness. The taste is wonderful. Lingering fresh strong fruity coffee followed by a grainy roastiness, chocolate and vanilla and another hit of stout bitterness at the end. So beautifully balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and silky but with some good tannins to refresh the palate.

4.52,15,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"12 oz. bottle, batch 7768 - packaged 12/21/06, sampled after breakfast on 3/6/07. It's not the official Breakfast Stout, but it's a close enough cousin, so I figured why not. It pours black into the chalice, thins near the edges, and is topped with a 1/4" brownish head that reduces to a nice collar, leaving little lacing. The bouquet is complex and delightful, with rich, roasted coffee right off the bat, closely followed by charred malts and sweet milk chocolate. There are additional notes of powdery cocoa, sweet cake batter, Oreos?, blackberry, and perhaps some piney hops. Upon tasting, my first impression is that of a milk stout brewed with coffee, balanced by a touch of green hops. To elaborate, there are roasted, coffee, and burnt malts, a big blast of espresso, a medium hoppy/roasted bitterness, a dash of green apple, and maybe some lactic sweetness. The mouthfeel is amazing - smooth and silky (like a milk or oatmeal stout), quite dry, with a medium to light body that has fine, active carbonation due to the conditioning. This is a great beer - it is smooth and refined in both flavor and mouthfeel, and manages to taste strongly of coffee without overwhelming the palate. Will definitely revisit at some point.","mmmbeer","Apr 09, 2007"

The beer smelled like you've walked into your favorite coffee house while they were brewing a chocolate flavored coffee or espresso. No malt, no hops, just a straight up chocolate flavored coffee or espresso aroma. It tasted like your favorite coffee house has just added a shot hazelnut flavoring to your chocolate flavored coffee or espresso. Like the aroma, no hops, no malt, just a straight up chocolate flavored coffee or espresso with a drop of hazelnut added to it. The label said that it was brewed coffee, but I think it was brewed with way too much coffee. They don't call it a "Java Stout" for nothing. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a thick aftertaste that's reminiscent of the aftertaste you get after drinking down a cooled down cup of Joe. I know they call it "Java Stout," but it's really just a one dimensional beer. I would have liked to taste more than just coffee. While I was drinking this, I questioned if this was really a beer. About half way through, I found myself bored of this beer.

It's bubbly too, with a lot of noticeable carbonation at the bottom of the brew. My premonition, however, did not come true, because the coffee smell here is nice, but not overwhelming; not enough to penetrate the bottle prior to opening. Wishful thinking on my part, perhaps. But there is a coffee/chocolate aroma here, with hints of smoke, wood, and dark fruit. Not an unpleasant aroma, but nothing special. But everything comes together in the taste. The coffee taste is powerful but spot-on. Mellows out with chocolate and some vanilla flavoring. Sweet and malty up front, but finishes with some balancing hops as well. This is kinda like eating a chocolate-covered coffee bean with a patch of dried fruit sitting in your cheek. Sturdy mouthfeel that develops more as the beer rises to room temp. Not everyone is going to like this beer, but if you're a fan of stouts you should give this a try. And especially if you like coffee-flavored stouts. This ranks among the top in that category.

It tastes a little leathery and musty, funky, with notes of coconut infused rum, or is it rum soaked curried nuts?. There is a faint coffee-like roast on the finish, and I'm getting a lot of nuances that one normally finds in a bourbon-barrel stout. I have to say this beer is really commanding my full attention. Medium-full body with sweetness flirting with the bitterness. It goes back and forth before finishing bitter. This is something I only want one of, but not because it's too filling or heavy or rich etc. but just because it delivers so much on my senses all around that one is enough to get the idea. I get it - good idea! I think it's Sumatran coffee which explains the earthy, leathery funkiness. Rad.","dedrinker","Feb 13, 2007"

All I could figure out in the taste was coffee with some alcohol. If I have a coffee stout I would like the nose and the taste to have at least a little hint of stout.

Pleasant, though. The taste has more to it than the smell. The coffee flavor is not all-dominant, but still of course a huge portion of the flavor profile. There are definite roasted malt and chocolate flavors hiding behind the coffee. There is a very nice lasting bitter coffee flavor in the back of the throat, too.

4.27,8.7,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Bottle received in a trade from hoppymeal -- many thanks! Batch number 7221; I'm assuming this is from last winter. Deep, dark-chocolate brown with a lovely light brown mocha head. No light gets through, but this still retains a definitively "brown" hue as opposed to out and out "black". Huge dark roasted coffee aroma, earthy and slightly burnt, with a thick Hershey's Dark chocolate syrup backbone and some slight toffee notes. This is getting me pretty excited, as the nose is really reminding me of the heavenly scent of Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout.... Okay, so KYBS it is not, but it is certainly a delicious coffee stout: roasted grounds bite the palate bitterly right away and linger to strafe the tastebuds throughout the swallow. There is a mildly astringent black malt flavor in the middle which approaches the point of sourness until it is overtaken by the dark bitterness of the coffee. I wish it had a bit more of the chocolate I detected in the aroma appearing in the taste. For that reason I'd say that, unless you like rather like coffee (as I do), this may come across as sort of one-dimensional. As it warms, a bit of oak character emerges, but it still doesn't make up for the chocolate the nose led me to expect. Despite this, the flavor is quite tasty, all told. Light in body for the style, and the alcohol is completely hidden, making for a very drinkable coffee stout. Definitely fits the bill when in the mood for a coffee-infused beer, more so at least than any other coffee beer I've tried.","orfeu","Jan 02, 2007"

I'd much rather just drink a Pepsi (well now a Diet Pepsi). I don't mind it at as an additive or flavoring and thus my like for it in beer. This however is too much. Usually with coffee stouts there is a balance with chocolate and/or smokiness but this is overpowering smoky coffee to the extreme. Not a bad flavor at all just too much of it.

Taste is hard-hitting, huge coffee and espresso, sinfully decadent rich and bold roasty malts and chocolate. Slightly drying bitter aftertaste just like a good cup of coffee.

The thing is that even when you exhale, you still get more coffee flavor. I don't think this is the most drinkable beer on the market, but from the other coffee stouts I have tried, it is delicious and I would not mind having another.

Taste starts with a bit of coffee, and then some sort of green flavor comes in, not strong, but I can only seem to describe it as fresh vegetables straight from the garden, then the taste shifts back into a bitter chocolate flavor before joining back up with the coffee for a choco-coffee finish. Med-high carbonation, thin little bubbles bounce around on the tongue, light bodied and pretty dry. Mouthfeel doesn't say Double Stout, says more Irish Dry Stout to me. I imagine this would be nice just about any time during the day, breakfast would fit in well with this, but it becomes a bit cloying by the end, one bottle would be enough.

Medium bodied and creamy, alcohol is hidden completely. Very good breakfast style stout, the coffee flavors and aromas come through well, I'm not sure I could do more than two or three of these before the coffee taste would wear on my palette, not to mention the alcohol content, but a very nice treat.","hoppymeal","Jul 06, 2006"

Aromas of slow roasted coffee, brown sugar, fresh bread, and malt seemed evident. The taste was dominated by expresso-like flavors with bitter coffee dominating the initial and end of each sip. In between was a creamy and slighly chewy blast of sweetness. Great depth and flavors; like having a beer and coffee at the same time, but in a good way. Over time, the sweetness became more dominant and near the end of my pint, it was too rich to fully enjoy.

There is a really nice sweetness in there too, very much chocolatey, but dominated with coffee. It almost smells like a mocha shake. I am a fan. Flavor is all coffee upfront. A little mocha creeps in after swallowing with some lighter chocolate notes, but it is a bit one dimensional. A modest bitter comes through on the finish, thought its not apparent if this is from the coffee or hopping. Don't get me wrong...I like it, but I'd like to see more going on with it. Feel is chewy thick, with a very minimal carbonation. Not too thick where it gets in the way of the brew. I think the feel really compliments the brew. Alcohol is not apparent on this brew.

Java diffinately dominates the flavor, but like the aroma, a chocolaty, malty backbone makes itself very present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little more carbonation than most other stouts. However, I think that is a good thing, as it doesn't interfere with the beers flavor, and makes it easier to drink. Overall, this is a fine brew.

Pours nice enough, black and thick, deep brown head that is fleeting. Aroma is also great. Rich and complex, coffee grounds, dark chocolate. Great coffee beers smell like fresh espresso, this is a bit stale though. Alcohol is apparent in the aroma. The ale is quite flat. This is typical of a thick stout, but it would have benefitted from more C02. Malty sweet and less dry than I like, the hops are also on the light side. Generally stale tasting and lacking somewhere. Again, more stale grounds than fresh espresso. On the positive side, the smoky toasted malts are nice and a rich fudge flavor emerges as it warms. As much chocolate malts as the base malt would allow are used here. Bravo to that.","ahking","Jan 20, 2006"

Aromas of cocoa and roasted malt mixed perfectly with coffee and sweet cream. Nice. Taste was superb; coffee, roasted malts and chocolate dominate and fill the palate with sweet, sweet flavors.

The initial pour was very smooth and did not churn or overhead in the glass. The head was chocolate brown and hung in there for the beer, though much thinner toward the end. The smell was a rich odor of dark coffee, roasted malts, and a slight alcohol nose. The taste was initially that of the roasted and dark malts but not overly sweet. The coffee flavor then came through and was very pleasant and not at all overpowering. The alcohol taste was noticeable on the back of the throat and a nice compliment to the deep, complex flavors of this brew. I really enjoyed this beer; I thought it was complex but well planned.

Huge coffee taste followed by huge roasted malt taste. Stout is not one of my favorite styles. This is an extreme stout IMO however and deserves to be tried at least once.

Nose has notes of toasted bread, milk chocolate, bakers chocolate and of course coffee. Warming after just a sip, the alcohol is clearly there but gives a nice balance to the rest of the flavors - and there's a lot to pick out.

The malty sweet aroma is accented by the coffee added to this beer. The coffee accents some chocolate malt added to the mixture. The coffee is more subtle in this beer than in others of this style Ive tried. It still dominates the taste, but doesnt mask some of the chocolate and other flavors that come from the malt. Any hops are completely disguised by the addition of the coffee. It has that same silky smooth Bells mouth feel, and has a decent drinakbility.

Aroma is chock full of coffee goodness with a lighter back by chocolate malts and a bit of roastiness. This smells like liquid coffee beans almost. Flavor starts of with a strong bitter coffee followed by chocolate and roasted malts. After taste is a bitter lingering coffee one. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a good amount of carbonation. Quite drinkable to if you like the taste of coffee otherwise the huge coffee flavors would get too much after awhile but for me its great.

Sweat beef, chocolate & of course lots of coffee hit youre nose from several feet away. The coffee aroma has a somewhat odd character too it, one that I guess is typical of coffee stouts, but that maybe is a bit more sour than it should be. Hard to pin down. Flavor is full & roasty, but disappointingly un-unified. An enjoyable, if confusing, blend of the darkest malt & unfinished coffee. The coffee character has the flavor of beans that have been soaked in cool water for a week rather than brewed. A fascinating flavor, but one that sounds better in theory than in execution. Better than the one I had when I bought the 6 last year, but not nearly as good as I had hoped after its time left to it's self.","Ave","Nov 01, 2004"

The aroma is almost strictly coffee as you can smell it twenty feet across the room. Overpowering to say the least. There is a hint of oreo cookie in the aroma as well as the flavor but coffee grounds again dominate both. I personally think the flavor is better than the aroma but is still too much like stale coffee grounds. The extremely astrigent harsh coffee taste is unpleasant. I had high hopes for this beer as I like both stouts and coffee but this took it too far. It isn't too much that I can't finish the beer but it sure comes close to that threshold. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy. This coffee stout does have some great characteristics but the coffee is taken too far. I can't drink caffeine as it gives me headaches and unfortunately this did give me one. Consequently, drinkability is way down for me.

Unlike malt-derived coffee flavors, here the real coffee used in the brewing process imparted a thin, harsh cold coffee flavor. For me, this was like their Cherry Stout - a beer that was an interesting exercise and worth having tried, but not one I care to have again.","Brent","Dec 14, 2003"

The taste of coffee, chocolate, and dark roasted malt is well balanced with the malt sweetness and warming alcohol. There is some slight bitterness but it isn't a hop bitterness, it must be from the coffee, chocolate and dark malt. For a beer this dark, and at 7.5% it is surprisingly drinkable.

Tastes like a dark roasted coffee at first then blends into chocolate and becomes quite sweet through the middle to the finish where just a bit of hop bitterness is detectable. Body is very full and thick, and it's quite smooth. In my opinion this beer is a good beer to finish a meal with or even drink with (or as) dessert.

Inital flavors of bitter coffee and this then mellows into a slight hazelnut, smoke, and slight hops finish on the tongue. The mouth is smooth but seems just a slight bit flat on the tongue.

I realize that that's the effect they were going for, but it doesn't really work well for me. There is a touch of bitterness, but I can't tell if it's the coffee or the hops.

Dry and roasted, somewhat bittering too in the smell. Taste is crazy espresso, deeply roasted dryish malt tones with all sorts of dry roasted bitterness thats very easy to handle.Finish is nice and levels off nicely leaving lingering espresso dryness, slight hop bitterness and light deep dark chocolatey tones across the palate. Its partially full, quite rich, barring heavyness, and silky smooth and packed with nice espresso flavors that are a bit overpowering at first if your not ready for it, but once it settles in, its fantastic.

Not unlike a rich coffee ice cream shake-- Unique and enticing aromawise. Coffee, while quite assertive in flavor, melds well with chocolate malt and pronounced dark caramel sweetness. When combined with the judicious hop bitterness and mild butterscotch diacetyl, an impression of sweetened mocha and cream bathes the palate. Full bodied, with an agreeably creamy mouthfeel. Subdued hint of black currant like fruitiness emerges late. Finishes with a lingering, balanced mix of residual sweetness and roasted barley bitterness.

What starts out as lacing on the glass ends up being sheeting and was a little more difficult than usual to clean. Even left my lips a little sticky. The aroma and flavor are very roasty and fairly dry. The coffee in the beer does more to reinforce and complement the roasty malt than to actually pop in the flavor. A black chocolate is submissive to the bitter roast. The mouthfeel is a bit gritty. The sourness present in a lot of the other November stouts is only a ghost lurking behind the other flavors.

Pretty good stuff if you are a java head. Mouthfeel is solid, a little carbonated but smooth. Alcohol-wise, it packs a punch.
