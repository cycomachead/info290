The aroma really is all there Taste is upfront stouty but really unoffensive. If youre ia stout head then this is very mild brew but still very flavorful and enjoyable. Very smooth and grainy.

Some molasses is present and provides a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation.

Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted notes with plenty of coffee presence. Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, oatmeal, toast, caramel, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, oatmeal, toast, caramel, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted flavors with coffee; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

Coffee is very strong in the aroma but it is toned down in the flavor portion quite a bit, such that it melds with all the grains instead of overpowers them. Don't expect a normal stout with this one, it's basically got lots of toasted, borderline roasty grain notes with coffee mixed in. Like a malt-heavy brown ale with coffee in a manner of speaking.

I became a big fan of Stumptown coffee during this trip, so I wasn’t surprised to find out that this ended up being finished with it, as the coffee character here was my favorite part of this. It was maybe a little too coffee heavy at times, as I really didn’t get any of the nuances from the multitude of grains used in this but whatever.

Smell is of brewed coffee, coffee grounds, and grain aromas. Taste is very heavy on the coffee flavor, almost like a strong coffee that some coffee grounds got into. There are also some grainy flavors but I have never had amaranth or kamut so I have no idea if these are present. Bitter coffee ground flavors stick around after each sip. A low level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout that is heavier on the coffee than the grains. Still a solid brew that I am glad I got to try.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 01, 2011"

The taste is dominated by the roast and the coffee, with the toasted oats maintaining the darkness. It's nice and charry, without being overbearing.

Huge tan head formed atop the jet black body. Smell was like roasted oats and espresso. Taste was excellent. Heavy grain presence. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, and roasted barley. The coffee flavor was there but did not overwhelm. It was a nice balance. This stout was not as thick on the mouthfeel as I would have expected considering the ingredients.

4.15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Somewhere, in a secret, candlelit room, the uninvited, unwelcome Rye Grain sits alone brooding. From floor to ceiling, the walls are plastered with iStockphoto.com stills of the various grains all X'ed out with bright red lipstick. This won't, this cannot end well. Survival Stout, with its wide array of various grains and added cold-pressed espresso presents a rich, inviting complexity and yet there's a very, very sensible ABV%. Recommended!","ChainGangGuy","Oct 02, 2009"
4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a great stout! Perfectly balance, well crafted brew. Sells for a decent price, this will be a staple stout in my fridge.","seanthornton152","Aug 09, 2009"
4.15,3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"22 oz. Dark black/brown pour with some translucentcy to it. Small tan head that disappated fairly quickly to a ring. Subdued roast malt and coffee aromas. Taste is much more impactfull. Good roast malt and grain, quite a bit of coffee throughout. Accents of dark chocolate, maybe some oatmeal, more rye likeness. Medium body, nice carbonation, almost creamy. Finish is lingering coffee. Aroma becomes more pronounced as it warms. Very drinkable. Not sure I'd call it oatmeal, but a very nice stout none the less.","Bung","Jul 24, 2009"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a very nice coffee note, toffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/bitter, malty, with lots of coffee notes, with toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, my first from this brewery, thanks Brian.","Wasatch","Jul 20, 2009"
