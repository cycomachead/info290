3.49,-1.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Overall: a decent Australian take on the English porter. The usual flavours of chocolate and roast coffee, with a touch of liquorice and caramel to boot. The price is right, at around AU$58 a case, but a slightly fuller body could have improved it somewhat. Nonetheless, an easy-drinking, reasonable beer.","SmashPants","Apr 26, 2014"
