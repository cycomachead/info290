3.69,-2.4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O: A solid porter that goes down a treat. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour possess a satisfying blend of roasted malt, coffee, mild molasses and earthiness. Good bitterness but not excessive. Nice body. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 07, 2013"

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours deep brown with a large, off-white head. The aroma is strong on cocoa powder and coffee, with a hint of roasty malts. The taste is good, it's got a great effervescent mineral character over roasted malts and chocolate. The mouthfeel is prickly and light, and the drinkability is good. A solid example of a lower ABV porter - the likes of which don't seem to make it over to US shores all that often.","shand","May 02, 2012"
3.95,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Intense aromas of burnt/roasted/toasted malts: these turn into coffee and chocolate flavours in the taste. A hop bitterness is never far away and I found this a complex and interesting Porter.","BlackHaddock",
