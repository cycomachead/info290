Despite being a couple years old, this beer tasted about as expected - like an acceptable brown ale-to-porter with a heap of maple syrup added to it. I'm still on the fence about adding extraneous ingredients to beers as this came off a little artificial tasting. I'd drink it again if I stumbled upon another Saranac winter craft pack for $10, but it's not something I would seek out.","Bockrules","0"

3.26,-8.7,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Reviewed on 2/14/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear dark brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, residual sugars. Flavor is quite full of maple syrup, which basically dominates the flavor along with some sweet caramel malt and brown sugar. Well, it is what it advertises. The aroma is pretty poor but the flavor is not too bad -- overall, a decent, maplely beer (although not a classic porter at all; it barely resembles a porter actually).","LilBeerDoctor","Aug 15, 2010"

3.38,-5.3,3,2.5,4,3,3.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Dark ruby color with a beige head. Light lacing. Aroma is of coffee, sweet malts, ash tray and maybe a touch of peanut butter?

4.22,18.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Just like a good, old-fashioned porter: dark, relatively clear coal-worker's brown; a bit of a Tiger-Eye effect when light oh-so-rudely pushed its way through. Speaking of coal, a good amount of toast comes through in the nose, some oddly satisfying combination of cooking smoke (as opposed to arson smoke) and dark pancake syrup. Damn, when they say "maple" they really mean it. Fair enow. Let's not forget the brown sugar and cinnamon in there as well, much less the possibility of nutmeg. At first, the spice rack is subdued on the tongue, with the sycophantic dark wheats receiving the favor instead. Not to be outdone, the spices roar back like the royal lion (rampant, natch), unseating those brown brown-nosers and bringing some winter oven goodness to the court. The king, he claps. The merriment is not too light, and the effervescence of the courtiers properly somewhat subdued, allowing the royals to soar above the room, leaving the whole land smiling beneath a short blanket of snow. And a hey-nonny-nonny.","TMoney2591","Apr 15, 2010"

3.3,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a brown color with some slightly reddish hues that appeared when it was held up to the light. It was light (in color) for a porter. The retention was ok and the lacing stringy. The aroma was of maple syrup, caramel malt and hints of chocolate malt. The flavors were also dominated by the maple flavor but it came off as quite artificial. As my friend aptly put it "It's like Aunt Jemima took over my beer!" The mouthfeel was a little watery, the body medium and the carbonation good. Very light for a porter and sadly very one dimensional as well. Just not what I think of when I want a porter and not one I'd recommend.","thekevlarkid","Feb 08, 2010"
3.66,2.5,4.5,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"The pour produced a finger of deep-tan head exploding with CO2 bubbles. Color was a deep cola-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose had a coffee-like roastiness accompanied by a chocolaty sweetness. Mouthfeel seemed thin for a porter and the prevalent taste on the tongue was a roasted bitterness, almost coffee-like. The finish was when I really caught the maple syrup flavoring mentioned on the neck of the bottle. Frankly, as one of the six different beers in the Twelve Beers of Winter pack, I was satisfied. Viva la difference, especially for the price! On its own, perhaps not so much.","woodychandler","Feb 06, 2010"
3.72,4.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A drinkable beer, but is that what you really want in a maple porter?

It was OK and I'd have it again if it came in a Saranac variety pack, but I would never buy a six pack of this beer. Nice effort and experiment by Saranac, just not my cup of tea. It might be a good breakfast beer if you were out all night, but not a session beer.","CHickman","Jan 26, 2010"
3.31,-7.3,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"D: Clever, curious, original, and fun, this one's not a session beer for me -- it's just too damn sweet and mapley. One of them is fine, but then I'm ready to move on. Curiously, it improves with food. Spicy chipotle chili is a good companion.","drperm","Jan 24, 2010"
3.33,-6.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer poured a copper color with a small head. The smell is mostly candy sweet with a little maple character but not a ton of toasted malt. This is a little on the weak side for a porter, but it certainly doesn't taste bad. The maple isn't as present as I expected, and doesn't overpower the beer. The mouthfeel is a little watery with some crisp carbonation. Not what I expected when I first saw it, but not in a completely disappointing way.","TheTrevor","Jan 21, 2010"
3.71,3.9,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very clear dark amber color with a thin lace of slightly tanned head. Minor retension and a bit of spotty lacing around the glass. The color really threw me for a loop, to me it looks more like a brown ale than a porter. Nose has a sweetness similar to brown sugar mixed with malt and a touch of hops. Taste is sweet upfront but not malty sweet, more of a sugar-like sweetness I am guessing from the maple addition. Kinda bland tasting throughout the body to a minorly bitter finish. Light feel and moderately carbed, it finished quite crisp. It is not bad, the maple seems a bit much and overall nothing exciting.","stakem","Jan 20, 2010"
3.55,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"D: A quaffable porter. Just extremely light on taste and feel to really consider this an indulgent brew. But a pretty good light porter nonetheless, and probably a good introduction to someone wanting to try this style.","irishking1977","Jan 16, 2010"
3.63,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is hardly a traditional porter by any means and the fact that you can really taste the roast of the malt may throw some people off. This includes me, I don't really feel you should be able to taste this much roasted malt. Also its missing the slight bitterness of many of the English porters I've enjoyed. Maple why not? An interesting idea and executed reasonably well, just wish this had more of the characteristics of a true porter.","MaxBrews","Jan 15, 2010"
3.77,5.6,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured from the bottle out of the winter sampler pack. Brown color with hints of red. Moderately thick light tan head. Left minimal lacing as it faded. Smells of caramel, toffee, maple, and a hint of nuttiness. Tastes almost exactly as it smells. The maple comes through strongly. There is a flat sweetness to the initial taste. It finishes with a moderate bite that lingers after you swallow. I was somewhat surprised that the beer tastes better colder than when allowed to sit for awhile. Mouthfeel is truly average, as rated, it is sort of flat but not entirely unpleasant. Drinkability is dependent on your tolerance for maple. My only complaint is that it became slightly less enjoyable as it sat longer in the glass. Overall, not bad, but more than one in a sitting might be too many.","BlueHammer","Jan 11, 2010"

2.52,-29.4,2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"D: I had to move on immediately after one, but Saranac is smart like that.

4.17,16.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a little light-colored for a porter, with minimal head, as is indicative of the Saranac brand. The smell promises chocolate and a faint hint of maple (duh). The taste delivers. While most porters and stouts taste like dark chocolate, the maple in this brew softens it, making it sweet and delicious. I've long thought of Saranac as a half-assed brewery for it's thin, watery beers, but now I'm starting to think that maybe they do it for a good reason. Not everyone likes a strong, high-APC beer, and for those among us with softer, more sensitive palates, Saranac's maple porter is about as good as it gets.","tlinner","Dec 13, 2009"

Large khaki tan head forsm thick with chunky lacing. Aroma has dark chocolate cocoa and an air of maple syrup about it nice sweet dark and roasty a good mix for the senses. Flavor is upfront with the sweet maple syrup additions with a nice straight forward porter with dark roasts bringing mild chocolate and coffee in the finihs. Herbal earthy hops come to play with a touch of bitterness really an English style porter with maple syrup flavoring.

3.57,0,3,3.5,4,3.5,3,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 2659-1138. Sampled on November 12, 2009. It pours an opaque brown-red and is not as dark as traditional Porters. There is almost no head and what there is simmers down to nothing in no time. There is a notable maple scent with the malts and hops but it is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is of medium body. The taste has a more pure maple flavor than the aroma. The roadted malts and hops are almost secondary. I feel like I'm drinking a bottle of maple syrup but it is nowhere near as thick. Interesting beer although it seems more suited for early spring when the maple sap is flowing.","puboflyons","Nov 08, 2009"
3.53,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall- Very enjoyable, could use a little more Mmphh but another good offering from Saranac. This years Winter variety pack is quite a good buy for $14!","NJpadreFan","Nov 05, 2009"
3.38,-5.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a dark brown color with some amber highlights peaking through. Big frothy khaki colored head that left some nice lacing on the side of the pint, settling into a nice cap. The aroma is of caramel malt and maple syrup, quite sweet. Some toffee and metal notes. Kind of like a coffee flavored candy. Very light roasted malt flavor, a touch grainy, maple syrup, burnt toffee, finishes with a lemony tart/bitterness. The feel is quite light with fizzy carbonation. The maple syrup sweetness would probably get cloying after one beer. An ok porter, probably could use some more body and roasted flavor. The maple isn't terrible but would probably be better suited with more of a malt body.","Gmann","Nov 02, 2009"

3.67,2.8,3.5,4,4,3,3,"12oz bottle purchased as part of a seasonal 12-pack at Shaw's in Windham, NH. Pours a copper-brown crystal-clear body with a good inch of somewhat short-lived light tan head that clings to the side of the glass. Espresso, dark chocolate with tinges of vanilla and maple in the aroma. Chocolate and espresso dominate the flavor too, with caramel, maple, and hints of vanilla. Reminds me initially of Kahlua (minus the booziness). Medium-bodied with ample carbonation. The sweet chocolatiness gets to be a bit much, not sure I could have more than one in a sitting (maybe it has to do with the Kahlua perception?), but it's sweet and fairly balanced. A well-made porter and well worth the try.","MrHurmateeowish","Oct 29, 2009"
3.48,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a tranlucent brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted malt scent with a little crystal malt sweetness. There is little to no maple aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry, roasted malt flavor with hints of maple syrup in the finish. There is light sweetness with a bone dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with prickly carbonation. This could be a really good beer, but it needs some basic adjustments.","WesWes","Oct 27, 2009"
4.3,20.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- I'd have a few of these. Quite possibly the best Saranac I've ever had, I was impressed with this one. They should put it into the 32 oz mini growlers I see their black forest in occasionally. I'd buy 'em for sure.","ShogoKawada","Oct 22, 2009"
3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Well, it is a maple porter. I just wish it was a bit thicker. Also, the maple tastes kind of fake as well. Regardless, still drinkable.","Brad007","Oct 20, 2009"
4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"D. A very good brew from Saranac. Nice flavor the maple was not too overpowering, allowing the robust porter flavor come through.","smibroncos","Oct 13, 2009"
3.61,1.1,2.5,4,4,3,3,"Bought the 2009 12 Beers of Winter last night and so far I am quite pleased! The maple porter I really wasn't expecting much from, but I am very pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of flavor here and it all works very well together. The maple is pretty convincing and tastes better than most of the stuff that you get on your waffles these days. The porter is more of a complimentary flavor set and does not take center stage. I have a feeling that this beer would be weak, watery and perhaps too bitter as a porter on its own. Luckily the maple is there to harmonize and bring this beer to the next level. If you do not like maple syrup you will probably hate this beer, but it really struck a chord with me and I will definitely be looking for this in a "brewer's choice" 6-pack this winter.","keaston","Beers"
3.98,11.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Saranac Maple Porter is a clear, orangish brown ale with a frothy, khaki head that has excellent retention and lacing. It smells very roasty, like coffee; lightly sweet and perhaps a touch wooden. It's medium bodied, bubbly, pretty smooth and dry. The finish is pretty dry. Like the aroma, it tastes very roasty, with notes of coffee and chocolate. It's excellently balanced with a bitterness that seems wooden. The maple comes at and after the finish. That's the flavor that lingers. This beer is well done, unique and very drinkable.","yesyouam","0"
