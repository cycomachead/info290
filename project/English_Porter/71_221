4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, this beer had every aspect that separates a English Porter from an American Porter and while i do prefer American Porters I can still appreciate this beer and know that it's a good example of the style.  What I like the most about this beer was just how true to style it is, it's just what I expect from an English Porter.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, It didn't have any off aspects or anything that shouldn't be there.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend this to anyone who likes English Porters.  All in all I was happy with this beer, I had heard this was good and it lived up to it.  This beer made for a good first impression of this brewery and I would be interested to try more of their beers.  As far as I can tell this is the best English Porter I've had.  Good job guys this, this was a good beer, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 01, 2015"
