4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, this beer had every aspect that separates a English Porter from an American Porter and while i do prefer American Porters I can still appreciate this beer and know that it's a good example of the style.  What I like the most about this beer was just how true to style it is, it's just what I expect from an English Porter.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, It didn't have any off aspects or anything that shouldn't be there.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend this to anyone who likes English Porters.  All in all I was happy with this beer, I had heard this was good and it lived up to it.  This beer made for a good first impression of this brewery and I would be interested to try more of their beers.  As far as I can tell this is the best English Porter I've had.  Good job guys this, this was a good beer, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 06, 2015"

Nice nose of caramel, coffee, toffee and a slight burnt chocolate smokiness.  Medium bodied with a texture that approaches creamy.   Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence on the finish.  The excellent flavor profile is complex and balanced.  It begins with coffee then flows into a light caramel sweetness coupled with toffee.  Hops come forward in the middle with a light flavor and bitterness over a smoky chocolate.  The finish is somewhat dry and leaves you with a lingering chocolate smokiness with a mineral character.","tillmac62","Sep 09, 2014"

The beer smell is rich and divine. The smell has a combination of bready yeast smell with a coffee smell and a sweet and light dark chocolate smell. The beer also has a milky smell as well. The taste is a bit different than the smell. The taste is less milky than the smell and has stronger bitter hop notes. The bready yeast note is still there but not as pronounced. The coffee roast taste is also there in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very silky with very little carbonation.

4.37,4.3,4.25,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I love Fuller's as a brewery and I have waited a while to try this classic porter, not because it is particularly difficult to track down but because as a darker malty beer it keeps longer in my way overstocked beer fridge: Gotta drink the hoppy ones first to capture the fresh aromatics. Finally fished a bottle out because it was a cold porter or stout kind of night. Anyhow, many sources claim that a good porter is dark brown to blackish with beautiful ruby red highlights (e.g., see Foster's book on Porter in the Classic Beer Styles series). Lo and behold, that's exactly what this brew looks like, quite sexy. Yes, sexy. Aroma is rich chocolate, roasted chicory, sweet dried fruit, and a little English hop earthiness. A little like sniffing a bag of chocolate-covered raisins. Palate lives up to the hype, massive English malt rustic complexity coupled with dark rich aromatic flavors of treacle, butterscotch toffee, pipe tobacco, and a little leather. Some floral aromatics and a tangy sour note dance on top, and there is also a healthy blast of dark bread crust likely from genuine brown malt (highly kilned rather than stewed, but there's chocolate malt in here too), with the latter particularly prominent in the finish along with a little charcoal. Less sweet and sour and more rich and toasty than some other London porters, probably this one is the benchmark for the lot. Moderately thick body with a decent amount of carbonation but the finish is a nice earthy bitterness that prevents things from getting too sweet or bubbly. Should be on any English beer fan's top 10 list and you can even get this in cans now.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 10, 2013"

All the great porter notes are present, coffee, chocolate, toffee, caramel, licorice, roasted nuts. The taste, easy drinking, follows the nose almost perfectly. What is really impressive is that flavors are very subtle and move seamlessly from one to the other culminating in a delightful roasted bitter finish.

It goes caressing your tongue with a coffee palate, then comes a chocolate, cherries and dark fruits. Coffee liquor like Kahlua or Tia Maria comes to mind. More complex than what I really said, it's a great beer.","janubio","Sep 20, 2013"

Or at least a little lighter than most porters. The smell has that burnt malt smell you'd expect but is also has a sweetness to it that you usually don't smell in a porter. At this point I'm not really expecting much out of this beer. The first sip changed my thinking quick. Very creamy and bold. It might be a little light but not to extreme to discount this as a porter. I very much enjoyed the consistency and drinkability. I think you can have a few of these in one session. Overall, I really liked this and will definitely have more of these is the fall and winter with some chilli.","sjones5045","Sep 03, 2013"

After a tasting, more complexity is noted, bringing to mind mocha, toffee, and graham cracker crust. The mouth feel is very creamy and smooth, and the finish even has a light touch of hop bitterness.

Good beer but there are others that are more complete. Drinkability is also great as well as the finish. It finished a bit sweeter and it's flavor stayed strong.","Utica_Brew_Review","Feb 02, 2013"

Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, cream, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light dark fruit, and light herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, citrus, toast, and herbal. Good amount of citrus and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toast, cocoa, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and robustness; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol presence is invisible, with zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a fantastic English porter! Great flavor robustness and balance; and extremely smooth to drink.

It's not hiding in subtleties, but just delivers the coffee, chocolate, licorice and caramel flavors with a nice balance of sweetness and a light bitter. If i had to criticize it, i'd say it's lacking a bit of depth. It's not something i'd drink all night, because it starts to bore a little after one. Although to me, this is quite common for a stout. It may be a little too sweet and straight forward for me to enjoy even more. But it's one of the better stouts out there, so i'd say: recommended!","Arno","Jul 21, 2012"

Pours a rich, cool sable that is just a kitten’s whisker above midnight black with a thick and fine-bubbled, it not too persistent, buff head. Flavor does not disappoint - smoked wood, roast coffee and licorice dominate the flavor but let through hints of treacle and herbs. Full body has plenty of fizz and leaves a nice smoky, slightly hoppy, slightly sweet finish. I can see - er, make that taste - why this is a top rated Porter!

There's an earthy and mineral flavor that does nicely to cut through the malt and provide some balance. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a creamy sweet mouthfeel.

The finish is nicely grainy. The body is light to moderate. This is a fantastic porter with a terrific balance and great drinkability.","MCDuhamel","Feb 16, 2012"

I get a lot of roasted malt and coffee on the nose, and, without surprise, I taste a lot of coffee when I first started drinking it. My initial reaction was that it tasted TOO much like coffee, but the other flavors started to creep in as the beer warmed. I started to detect a minute amount of bitter chocolate, with the coffee taste mellowing somewhat as the beer warmed. Roasty, yet smooth. A pleasant offering, although I admit I will probably won't give this beer its due because I'm not a coffee drinker.","airforbes1","Jun 27, 2011"

It is nothing over the top, like this is more of a classic porter taste as opposed to an off the wall different tasting porter that you can find a lot on the American market, but don’t get me wrong this is a quality porter and runs circles around your macro Guiness, Kilkenny, etc. This would be a go to for me when I am looking for a good porter to drink a couple of them for cheap in a night, although I did enjoy the double chocolate stout from young’s a lot more.","Roke87","Jun 26, 2011"

4.31,2.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours out to a black body with a tan head that has good retention and solid tan lacing clinging to the sides of the beer mug. The smell is strong in chocolate with hints of coffee, roasted malts and a smoked flavor. The taste at first is chocolate followed by some coffee, some bitter hops, and roasted malts. The finishing taste is of smoked hickory and leaves a chocolaty aftertaste.This beer is also well balanced so it is not too bitter, but not to sweet either. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy that clings to the mouth, tongue, and cheeks. This is a really nice medium to full bodied beer with decent carbonation that would go good with dark chocolates, or as a good after dinner beer. Just be careful because once you have one I'm very sure you will want another.","DannyDan","Dec 24, 2010"

It's just a bit too sweet, ultimately. The flavors verge on candy bar, which is meant less negatively than it reads. I think my scores would go up with a stronger mouthfeel.

Strong toffee and slightly less intense chocolate aromas hit me first; I also detect notes vaguely reminiscent of hazelnut coffee. Taste-wise, the front and mid-palate are very evenly balanced between these sweet and bitter elements. Finishes long on with a tasty toffee character.

Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a somewhat creamy texture.

Popping the top this brew smells like chocolate and black licorice. Pours to a jet black with a thin tan head. On the taste there is lots of well roasted malt, some dark chocolate and a smooth bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and thick almost chewy but not syrupy. Finish is a bit metallic with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Not as tasty as an American porter in my book but for an English porter it hits the mark. Very drinkable.","mooseisloose","Apr 22, 2010"

The initial taste of the beer is that of burnt/roasted chocolate, paving the way for the coffee, espresso, and roasted/burnt caramel malt.

I am pretty sure that this bottle was sitting in a fridge for most of those 3 years. The yeast and carbonation are indeed still very active even this 3 years past the best by date! This beer pours a clear, dark brown color with auburn highlights. The tan head is about 3 inches thick when poured,l settling to a good nice after about 5 minutes. Good lacing. Head finally settles to a good 1/3 inch after a few sips/ Good staying power. Aromas of malty chocolate and coffee are certainly present, along with a sort of roasted nut aroma too. Brown nutty, roasted malt and coffee flavor upfront, giving way to sweeter chocolate flavors. Not really any hops, maybe a slight trace at most. Has a crisp, but mainly smooth, creamy, and frothy mouthfeel that coasts your palate. Full body with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink in a good way. I was certainly impressed.

The flavor likewise incorporates the above with a bit of hops & malt, and a carbonation that lets the alcohol linger. The taste turns from the sweeter components to a more bitter flavor that rests nicely throughout your mouth and in particular, on the sides of your tongue.

The aromas are very welcoming with hints of chocolate, coffee, caramels, nuts, and some sweet fruity notes. It has a nice smooth mouthfeel and texture to it with a slight carbonation to it. Tastes of dark chocolate and expresso take control with subtle fruity and sweet tastes round it out for a very solid drinkable porter.

The appearance reminds me of soda like root beer or coke with less carbonation. In the nose we have chocolate, coffee, and a good amount of black licorice. Milk chocolate and licorice are the first taste followed by a dry hop bitterness. A decent amount of complexity makes this a delightful tasting beer. The mouthfeel could be richer for this style. Regardless of that, this is a really tasty and well made beer - easy drinking. Highly Recommended.","montageman","Nov 06, 2007"

Poured a solid deep mahogany color with a finger of off-white head that dissolves a little quick for me. Solid lacing. Nose is pure, almost sweet roasted malt - roasted molasses maybe. Some light prunes, even pomegranate. Flavor is interesting. First off is actually tons of toasted malt. Some orange. Coffee. Not nearly as fruity and sweet as the aromas would suggest. A taste reminiscent of cigarettes as well, which I'm not loving. Light nuts and a hint of chocolate. Body is fairly full, with solid carbonation. I was totally turned off by that initial cigarette-y flavor (I have no idea what it could be), but it faded as I drank, and by the end I was quite enjoying this one.","soupyman10","Sep 22, 2007"

Poured a dark although not completely opaque liquid with a light mocha-tan head that was a finger thick and had staying power. Good lacing. An understated aroma of figs gave way to the smell of a freshly opened box of dark chocolates, very subtle, not overpowering. Very good taste and mouthfeel with a smooth texture, well balanced bitterness and chicory overtones. The pleasant finish leaves you wanting more.

The taste is very well balanced. Thick and creamy with dark roasted malts, molasses, nutty chocolate, and mildly bitter ending. Not too strong (alcohol-wise) keeping the taste mild for such a heavy beer. One of the most drinkable porters I've ever had simply because of the mouthfeel and rich character. Very close in competition with Sam Smith.","Rudgers73","Aug 07, 2007"

Aroma is a mixture of roasted malts, coffee, and fruity apple-like notes as well. Taste begins with the coffee up front, but quickly gives way to hints of dark chocolate, and toasty caramel, with an ever-so-slight hop note....also a touch of fruitiness in there too, which seems to be a signature of English styles. This brew is easy on the palate with it's medium body, and finishes with a lingering chocolate-coffee effect. I could enjoy this one as a desert, or in the pub all damn day.

Dark chocolate start, bitter coffee finish, A lingering coffee with a slightly hoppy aftertaste that makes the mouth tingle. Just the right amount of carbonation to make the bitter finish stick around for a while, but doesn't allow it to overstay its welcome, inviting the drinker in for another taste. Overall a very rich complex brew that is worth drinking.","andebrice","Feb 23, 2007"

This beer had fantastic smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and light traces of toffee. The taste...oh what a taste it is....again, dark chocolate, with a heavy backing of rich black coffee that gave a subtle bitterness to the beer, following the English Porter style wonderfully. The mouth feel was substantial, but light enough for multiple pints of this beer to be enjoyed in one sitting. I could, and have, consumed this beer on a very regular basis.

I poured the bottle in a thick pint glass, and noticed very little carbonation. Short, caramel head. The aroma of this beer is excellent... mostly chocolate with some caramel. First taste hits the buds quite a lot more than other Porters I've tried. Reminiscent of a dark-roasted coffee. More hops that I expected, and not very heavy. After a few sips, the flavor settles into a very smooth and malty taste. This is an excellent Porter, no doubt about it.","bdupree","Oct 24, 2006"

The aroma is a huge improvement on the appearance; big malty chocolate aromas (think malted chocolate milk) jump right out, along with crispy roasted malts and just a hint of fruity sweetness (raspberry?). Beautifully balanced mouthfeel, with some roughness from roasted malts and some hops coexisting perfectly with a slickness not far from an oatmeal stout's. Tasty chocolate notes, along with dry roasted malt notes, form the backbone of this beer, but there are also earthy hops and a bit of smoke in the palate. This is truly a wonderful porter, one of the best English examples of the style that I have ever tasted.","geexploitation","Oct 23, 2006"

The flavor is rather fleeting, it appears and then disapears. Mouthfeel is medium light with a tangy carbonation. On the edge of too light for a porter in my estimation.

Deep translucent red -- almost purple -- leaning towards brown: like cherry cola with a frothy beige foam cap. Nose of sweetish roasty malts, caramel and vinous fruit aromas. Thin to medium bodied, the roasted malts flavor in this porter are much more subdued than anticipated. There is primarily a vinous cherry flavor (bordering on sour), with a smoky-charred character towards the end. Mineral finish. Earthy hop flavors and roastiness emerge as the beer warms. Very easy to drink, but I think it's probably better closer to room temperature. I wonder if this is ever served on cask...probably (?)...never been to London. Anyway, classy beer.

There's a slight astringency, which is the only think that kept me from giving it a 5 for drinkability. The flavors that are there are just right, particularly the unexpected chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, no sharp carbonation or thick creaminess--just an even, reasonably substational body.","GnomeKing","Feb 27, 2006"

This had a nice roasty coffee flavor. It made me regret not drinking more porters as I often bypass them as being rather heavy. This was not.

The color is like black coffee. The smell is faint, but you can detect chocolate, coffee beans, and marshmallow aromas. Very toasty. The taste is similar, with coffee flavor that is somewhat smoky. Decent bitterness. It seems average at first but improves very much over a few sips. The mouthfeel is slightly thinner than expected, and the carbonation is fairly low, although it doesn't necessarily feel flat.

Stong and appetizing, it screams coffee and red wine to me. One of the few malt-centered beers that I could whiff all day long. Flavor is wonderful too. Charcoal and molasses, coffee and red wine. All I could ask for in a porter. Thin body and low carbonation is pulled off with help from the dryness and acidity. Very easy drinking, this one has a ton of flavor but is not as filling as most stouts or other malt-centric beers. A classic for all time!","waughbrew","Dec 28, 2005"

Theres considerable malt, with a lightly roasted (again, chocolaty) smell. At times theres a little distracting smell that seems slightly like burnt grain. All in all, the aroma is amazing. Little hops, and very little fruitiness in the smell. The first sip reveals that this beer is full and satiating. Very creamy (at times, with the big chocolate aroma, it seems almost like a thick chocolate milk). The brew dries out by the finish, which is just bitter enough to offer some balance.

Tastes sweetly of chocolate, dark grain, toast, coffee, and a little cream like. Add in slight raspberry and plumb flavors. A mild sourness runs through, maybe lactic acid; albeit light.

A nice refreshing tingle on the tongue, and not too thin either. Just right. Drinkability, well I'd say it's quite good, even on this hot hot night, though I would say it'd be better suited for a winter evening or something like that. Anyway, it is easy drinking, smooth and never boring.

This porter isn't as dark as others I've seen, a bit of red showing through the edges of the glass. Smell is strong bitter coffe, roasted malts, and something that oddly reminds me of those little bacon bits things. Odd, because I've been a vegetarian since 8th grade. But strangely interesting. Taste is nice and bitter, unusual for a porter. It's got a nice hoppy backbone, which I usually don't notice in English beers, which I've just recently gotten into. Of course all the roasty toasty qualities of a typical porter are there too, and in full effect. Nice dark bitter malts and creamy undertones. A medium bodied porter like this goes down effortlessly. Another great brew from a classic English brewery. Between their ESB, 1845, and Porter, which I've all just recently tried, I'll be supporting Fuller's a lot in the near future.","twelvsies","Feb 28, 2005"

Similar to the nose--dark roasted malt, chocolate caramel coffee profile not nearly as bitter as some porters. Mouthfeel is nothing noteable but good still.

4.3,2.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, dark brown with an off-white head that subsides quickly. The aroma is of sweet malt balanced by a dry, burnt black malt aroma with no hops to be detected. The taste is very flavorful as the dark malts are no the only thing to be tasted in this beer. Porter was a blend of stale/old ale and new pale ale and brown ale, if this is to be a single sytle that incorporates all three then i will say that i believe iot could be true. The dark malts give us the brown aleish character as well as the dry, sharp stale ale flavor while possesing more hops than a stout so we can attribute these flavors to the pale aleness. With a rich malt profile the dark malts dont; overpower this brew due to a sweet maltiness that is hard to percieve as it blends into the whole malt flavor. A bit of hop flavor in the mix keeps thing interesting so that it is clear this is not a stout. Light carbonation lends a smooth mouthfeel to this beer and it is a nice porter that would make a pretty good session beer as well.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 09, 2004"

The beginning is what you would expect from a porter, a roasted malt type flavor which leads to a certain malty sweetness in the middle. The aftertaste is light and of coffee. The mouth feel at the end is water which leads to a high drink ability, smooth and almost creamy. They way that all the flavors blend smoothly and subtly together in this beer is what makes it great.

4.09,-2.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"London Porter sits comfortably in the British pint glass, giving out dark ebony and super-dark red hues, looking thick and syrupy. The head is a copious, creamy, thick and viscous light-brown foam. The lacing sticks very well, leaving a screen of fine bubbles, and scarcely moving at all. The appearance is excellent by any standard, but, at the same time, I have seen many porters that look just as impressive. Rich is the word to describe the aroma: yes, rich, robust, heavy, full, nutritious, earthy, and very sustaining. A warm creamy smell greeted my nose first, next vanilla, strong dark licorice, then the chocolate/coffee malt. The aroma definitely exudes a literal warmness; small wonder this is a perfect brew for the colder season. Raisins, milk/cream, vanilla, mollasses, definite butter, with deep grain and malt. The taste is also full and robust. Sweet chocolate, coffee beans, mollasses, slight milky tartness, and on the finish chalky, grainy feelings; dusty, with a fitting hop dryness. The alcohol shows up in the finish as well, warming the stomach nicely. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and buttery, almost oil-like slickness. This creaminess makes it easy to drink, though the dryness in the finish might become excessive after too many, not to mention the fullness it leaves in the stomach(which is a good thing). Well, I tried this out of season, in the hellish heat of July; perhaps this winter I will visit London Porter again. Right now, however, it rates high for me, but not as high as others I have tried. I cannot help but point to Samuel Smith, though I hate comparing. Something in the beers of SM, the water perhaps, make them far more complex than any other brewer of good darks in Britain right now. Still, Fuller's has not disappointed me in the in least with this, though I prefer their ESB and London Pride.","Cwrw","Jul 21, 2004"

Smell is of brown sugar and molasses, dark chocolate and mocha/coffee smells linger that will melt your heart. Taste is very sweet, brown sugar and molasses/caramel forefront, with roasted malt/coffee aftertones. Beer is light enough where you can drink it in the heat but thick enough to feel you up after a nice meal. Full bodied but smooth and slick as butter, goes down very nicely. Probably the best porter I've had to date, when you are done you will wish you had more.","beertaster13","Jun 21, 2004"

I had to be careful because this was so smooth and went down so easy. I really enjoyed this beer. This is a great example of a porter and I would definitely recommend it.","mattcrill","Jun 19, 2004"

The real gem of this porter is the aroma. Wafting sents of coffee bean and dark chocolate are very apparent but not too overwhelming. Lacks the richness of taste and robustness for a post dinner sipping drink but is still very palate friendly. Little to no aftertaste to speak of and the lack of hardiness helps you almost crave another (Or at least another smell)","beckerboots","Jun 04, 2004"

Lacing was spotty, kind of disappointing. This beer smelled great, with a mixture of caramel sweetness, and an earthiness that reminded me of wet leaves. Caramel flavor came through big mixed with a hint of roastiness, and chocolate. I've had a few porters that tasted more like stouts to me, but this one had no identity issues. I did get a little tired of the caramel flavors towards the end of the glass, but this beer still remains a great porter.","Onceeven","May 30, 2004"

Nice thick mouthfeel that's chewy and refreshing. Great drinkability, no matter what time of the day.

Laced excellently with foam coated the glass sides from top to bottom at the end of the drinking experience. Aroma is medium and dark malts, even apparent through the nitro head. Taste was of the malt, then softened with an almost perfect complementary amount of hops. This brew impressed me by being able to blast its flavor through the normally deadening nitro presentation. This ability combined with the nitro-smoothing effect made the mouthfeel and drinkability tops in my book.","ppoitras","May 02, 2004"

The retention was fair, although it left little lace on my pint glass. Its aroma was of chocolate and little else, but out was strong and inviting. The chocolate flavors were much more subdued than I had expected from the aroma. There is little hopping, but some burnt malts provide a balance to the sweetness. It's a decidedly British beer, light in the mouth and a little creamy. It would make a fine session brew.","AllThingsNinja","Apr 02, 2004"

Creamy off-white head that soon fades to a thin mottled cap upon the ale. Earthy aroma at first, faint coffee and chocolate, and a dry woody smokiness. Earthy coffee flavour, tapering off to a smoky aftertaste, like pipe tobacco. Full but very dry mouthfeel, with a lingering roasted husk aftertaste. I'm not a smoker myself, but I could see this accompanying a pipe quite nicely, or any very smoked meat dishes. A very nice change from some of the very cloyingly sweet porters that I have sampled in the past. I must salute northyorksammy for enabling me to finally sample this after itching for it for so long.","IronDjinn","Apr 01, 2004"

Taste is much of the same, with a smooth, not too sweet finish. Its not as heavy/filling as I expected. Quite a satisfying beer, and I usually do not even like Porters.

The taste was the same, but I have had some porters that had a lot more complex smell and flavors. It does have a coffee-like taste that is nice. It was strong in the mouth, but one and done is the order of the day for this porter. I have to mention that in our area this retails for over $9.00.

The head dies away with some spottiness, not really returning even with a swirl of the glass. The beer's color is dark, very dark brown; when held to light, fairly glows with a ruby-brown translucence. A lazy streamer glides upwards... Aroma is dusky and rich, deeply toffeeish. Toasting caramel sugars, brown sugar on white buttered toast (cinnamon might be stretching it a bit), enormous molasses; chocolate shavings and a nuttiness; and yet to all this sweetness there is a dryish "snap," a "pucker," if you will... and a plush, mallowy nosefeel. Quite nice. Flavor is wow big molasses with a gingery snap across the tongue. Chocolate brownies, liquid Oreo cookie sweetnesses in the forepalate resolve into coffee-with-sugar-and-cream bitterness at the back; the hops never outstanding but rounding this off well. Perhaps a bit of hazelnut syrup in that coffee? Mouthfeel is almost fluffy, not heavy in the least, and perfectly coating without being viscous; a softly dry finish. Mouthwatering.

Coffee, chocolate, and bits of fruit with a trace of hops make a delightfully complex smell. The taste is equally enjoyable, with everything melding together impecably.

Just different shades of black. A big, beautiful 2 finger head that slowly dissipates with each sip. Ooooh, what a smell. Roasted malts, bread, sugar, burnt coffee, dark chocolate, blackberries, raisins are smelled. Great taste. Starts out sweet, with the malt kicking, leaves burnt and bitter, with the dark chocolate and slight hint of hops exiting the mouth. Something is out of place, however. Is that licorice, or another dark fruit? I couldn't place my tongue on it. Whatever it be, it's pleasant. A little odd, but pleasant. Silky, creamy, smoooth mouthfeel. It coats the throat in sinful pleasure. Drinkable? Damn straight. One could drink a dozen in a row and still enjoy the last as if it were the first.

This one never even went into the fridge, and I'm glad, as the flavor was truly something to savor. The mouthfeel was downright creamy. Made me wonder what beer fudge might taste like.

The taste is of roasted malts with a touch of chocolate and coffee. It has a very smooth feeling while still a little watery. It is bitter and has some earth tones.

Taste is essentially more of the same with a minor Goldings hop bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a touch watery and thin. Easily drinkable, just not as full and palate-coating as I prefer in this style. Nonetheless, a very good English porter from a world-class brewery.","Jon","Aug 27, 2003"

This beer appears to be very dark and almost black, but reveals itself to be the deepest crimson when held up to a light. The head is tan and fluffy and the lacing is consistently present all the way down the glass. Aromas are of roasted malts and some light smokiness. Taste a sweet creamy milk chocolate with a slight burnt bitterness at the end. There is a light smokey feel to the taste as well.

There is a strong taste of chocolate malt surrounded by the before mentioned patent, crystal, and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is fine.

3.98,-5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"For a porter, this is definitely an assertive example, especially with hops that surprised me with their strong presence in the flavor profile. The hops start out bitter in the front and built during the middle only to fade into the finish and linger for a bit afterwards. A bit of burned bread is dominate in the middle of the flavor and while I'd be surprised if smoked malt is part of the mash, something's making me think of a campfire. A surprisingly good example of what a porter can be. Warm and toasty, but not as big and chunky as their huskier brothers, the stouts.","aracauna","Jul 22, 2003"

Smell is deeply roasty/toasty malts with a slight burntness with notes of hazelnut, dark toffee, and coffee. Taste is a fair amount of roasted malts, burnt-like toast and coffee, a bit acidy in the middle into the end where a tiny little fruityness slips in, finishing with a hoppy mellow dryness that balances well. Feel is medium to thin in abundance, no real richness or heftyness to be found for my idea of a robust porter. Its a solid porter by many means and quite a good drinker, I was hoping for more though.","tavernjef","Jun 20, 2003"

Poured a deep black with a cafe au lait head that was not too think but very creamy, especially for a bottle. The smell was deep, damp and earthy with aromas of sweet chocolate and toffee. The taste was rich and dark with serious notes of coffee dominating the taste and a well placed bitter hop finish hidden deep within rolling waves of toasted malts. The mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy and thick for a porter, but it was not at all obtrusive.

Crisp and only slightly bitter. This is one of the finest Porters I've had the pleasure of knowing. I'm not real high on English bottles but this is an outstanding example.

There is a punch of dark chocolate and roasted malts noted upon initial smell, followed by mild aromas of coffee and butterscotch. The taste has just as many different aspects as the aroma. Coffee and roasted cocoa are definitely the dominating flavors here, finished off with a slight bitterness of hops. This is a very well balanced, full-bodied beer.

Not overly impressive in appearance, but this beer is perfectly balanced. Wonderful chocolate notes, smooth (but with enough bitterness to balance it just right). I really can't find any fault in this beer (and it's outdated - 8/02!). Can't imagine how good a fresh one would taste! (I did end up finding a new 6, and it was even better.

Very nice bittering on the finish gives way to a long, roasted coffee aftertaste that is sprinkled with cocoa. Mouthfeel is good, with a lighter body and perfect carbonation. Drinkability is also good, but the powerful flavors keep you from pounding this one. It is one to be savored and enjoyed, not guzzled. A very good beer.","aaronh","May 21, 2003"

The head is a dense light beige, yet disappears quickly. Malt, caramel, chocolate, and coffee dominate the aroma. The taste is again, very malty; rich chocolate, coffee, and a bit of treacle come through. Unlike a lot of American interpretations, there is a definite absence of roasted barley and a decision, instead, to focus on the black, chocolate and crystal malts. A lot of domestic porters have a stout-like taste profile due to the use of roasted barley (though usually in smaller quantities than in stouts). Very good, indeed. Taste this alongside Anchor Porter (also an outstanding porter, imho) and you'll see what I mean about the roasted barley.","johnrobe","Feb 20, 2003"

The taste was similiar to the nose. It started off with the dark chocolate and malts and finished with a creamy buttery taste. There was a strong coffee aftertaste and the mouthfeel was very smooth.

The roastness is so much forefront that there is a bit of a "bite" from the roasted malt. The hop bitterness is at a good level, but kept in check by the roast malt flavors.

One of the best beers I have tried.","Dogbrick","Oct 16, 2002"
4.77,13.8,4.5,5,5,5,4,"Dark brown with a garnet hue; clingy tan head. Toffee, caramel and coffee in the nose--supremely inviting.  Low carbonation and an extra-creamy mouthfeel. Sweet flavors of chocolate, coffee and caramel are dominant. Tops on my list of porters--a must-have, particularly on draft.","doerickson","Sep 26, 2002"
4.5,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From the toffee-like aroma to the charcoal finish. Fat, sticky head that tops a walnut edged pitch liquid wonderment. Roast and toast and hop and malt and balance, balance, balance. A superb Porter that compels you to drink it down. Simple and elegant.","inebrius","Aug 15, 2002"
4.42,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This has to be one of the best Porters on Earth. so damn tasty! Jump on the bandwagon if you havent already!","bditty187","Jul 24, 2002"
4.42,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Mmmm, I love a good porter and this is one of them. Smooth is the word - malt, coffee and chocolate to die for. Yet there was my favorite taste in there to - some hops to keep me happy. Another brew that kept giving different flavor bursts from start to finish.","MTMugs","Jul 21, 2002"
4.1,-2.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I have been drinking alot of porters lately and this one is not too bad.  It is a deep amber color with moderate white head.  It had a malty aroma.  It was less roasty, but more chocolate than the Sam Smith Taddy Porter.  I liked it a little better than the Sam Smith too, not quite as stout.","ryanocerus","Jul 12, 2002"
4.37,4.3,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"This is a great porter!  The head is dark in color which gives you the idea that it is an oatmeal stout, but upon tasting it, you realize you have stepped into a realm that is not matched.  The chocolate flavor is great but at times a little overwhelming.  The malt is very present towards the middle and can be complemented with a nice shot of irish whiskey.  It finishes very smooth and definitely makes you want to come back for more.  Definitely my favorite foreign Porter.","Maestro","Jul 03, 2002"
4.88,16.5,5,4.5,5,5,5,"I have to say that this is one of the best beers I have ever had.  Because it was hand-pumped, I know this review is slightly inflated; but I don't care.  Tremendous beer, beautiful dark color with tan head- you could see the richness ebbing from the top.  Carmel sweetness, but a rich, dark chocolate flavor, with some bitterness pulls you in and never lets you out.  So fresh, nothing to distract from the taste. Creamy, but not in a nitro way- just and abundace of flavor.  Wonderful.","AaronRed","Jun 21, 2002"
4.13,-1.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark brown with a reddish tint. Nice sticky tan headholds pretty well. On the nose there are aromas of caramel and malt and touch of toffee and coffeesame on the palate caramel, chocolate notes, and toffee all becomes more flavorful as it warms a bit. At first it tastes lighter then Id like, but by finish time, a nice sweetness pulls through. Very enjoyable brew!","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 20, 2002"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Okay, this is my first try at Fuller's attempt at a porter, having already sampled their 1845 and ESB.  It had a wonderful very dark ruby red color.  It created a wonderful dark tan head, but it failed to hold, but that may have been due to the temperature I had it chilled at.  The taste is good, with elements of chocolate, coffee and perhaps toffee.  The finish is good, it a little lighter than I like for this style.  Also applys to the body of it, while good, really not as heavy as I like porters to be.","Wildman","Jun 04, 2002"
4.62,10.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours dark ruby with a nice thin beige head that retains nicely.  One of the best smelling porters I've come across.  Nutty, roasty and chocolatey.  Very, very nice.  Wow.  What a creamy mouthfeel.  This is really an outstanding porter.  I've had this before but never had this type of experience.  (They were probably old beers in past.)    Great coffee taste and roasted tones.  Vanilla bean and bittersweet chocolate make their presence known.  Full body.  What a treat.  Great way to cap the night.","Bighuge","May 23, 2002"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Almost black in color with tannish colored lace. Great taste and full bodied. Another great brew from a great brewery.","Reverand","May 21, 2002"
4.44,6,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Dark ruby brown, almost opaque...nice pillowy head, absorbs drips like a sponge. Pronounced sweet mocha smell, one of the nicest smelling brews I've ever had. Deep, deep roasted to burnt chocolate flavors right off the bat, with a very smooth and consistent fade. Some sense of anise complexity as well. Satisfying richness in the back of the throat. Minimal hops, but they do add in concert with the coffee flavors in mid mouth. Medium body combines with lack of over-carbonation to give a nice mouthfeel without an overbearing impact. Nice Porter to be sure...","ADR","May 10, 2002"
4.08,-2.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"WHEW!  If I'm ever gonna be slapped in the face by anything other than a female, this is the one.  It's a slap you can smile about.  Roasted coffee with a taste that lingers.  Maybe a bit of chocolate tasted after your first breath. Only my second Porter to try...very different than my first, but I like it.  Small head that leaves a lace all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Thumbs up!","BeerAngel","Apr 25, 2002"
4.59,9.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Medium to full bodied with a wonderful balance all around.  This porter is among the very best as far as I'm concerned-- perfect carbonation, chocolate malt flavor, black patent bitterness and exactly the right amount of bittering and flavoring hops.  Just great stuff.","marc77","Mar 07, 2002"
3.9,-6.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Good, but perhaps a bit too thick, not really elegant, but a good porter, very complex, and bitter, goodstuff.","rastaman","Feb 17, 2002"
4.2,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Notes: A more than decent porter ... a great brew during the wet raw days of late fall / early winter. Goes great with imported chocolates also.","Jason","Feb 11, 2002"
4.06,-3.1,5,4,4,4,4,"very dark and full bodied, a stronger taste of licorice? and coffee tones than other Porters. My porter of choice, and as in most English brews very smooth. Best in winter. I'm having second thoughts on this being my Porter of choice. The last two times I had this I wasn't sure I liked the very strong finishing taste. I think I might prefer the more mellow tones of the Anchor and Anderson Valley porters.  Still this is a great beer!","Mark","Feb 11, 2002"
4.46,6.4,5,4,5,4,4,"An exceptional, classic London porter. With it's simple complexity you know exactly what you're getting and won't be dissappointed. A treat on tap.","John","Jan 04, 2002"
4.76,13.6,5,4,5,5,5,"Fuller's London Porter in the bottle.  Ruby black in color. Sweet malty aroma with a lot of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate.  Strong hops with dark roast coffee and dark chocolate taste.  A very good bitter mocha aftertaste.  This is my first porter and in my opinion it is an excellent beer.  I hope to find this one on tap one day.","ThreePistols","Nov 20, 2001"
4.76,13.6,5,4,5,5,5,"A typically fine product from Fullers.  Pours with a big tan head that leaves a nice lace on the side of the glass as you drink.   Very smooth, with hints of coffee and chocolate.  A creamy, almost buttery mouthfeel that leads to a fairly dry finish.","BKotch","Oct 23, 2001"
4.06,-3.1,5,4,4,4,4,"The first time i had this was with a slice of birthday cake and they actually went great together. I woudlnt say this is my favourite porter but it's close.","xXTequila","Oct 02, 2001"
4.76,13.6,5,4,5,5,5,"A great porter.  Lots of depth of flavor, with dark coffee and a hint of dark chocolate.  If it were any more substantial, it would be a stout.","Brent","Jun 20, 2001"
