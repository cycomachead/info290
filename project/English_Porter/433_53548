At 4,8% ABV it's very light. Wish it could be around 6 or 7 ABV. But if you are in a bar and wanna try a dark ale and this is the only option, why not give it a try.","kevofficiel","Aug 14, 2014"

From what I've tasted so far, the Rickards line is far superior to its macrobrewed brethren in every single aspect. Rickards Dark is no exception: It offers a beautiful glassful of goodness that is incredibly sessionable(like any good porter should be). Do yourself a favor now and pick up a Rickards taster pack (like I did) and I am willing to bet that you won't be disappointing with a majority of the Rickards line.","PorterPro125","Jul 14, 2014"
