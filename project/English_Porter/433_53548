From what I've tasted so far, the Rickards line is far superior to its macrobrewed brethren in every single aspect. Rickards Dark is no exception: It offers a beautiful glassful of goodness that is incredibly sessionable(like any good porter should be). Do yourself a favor now and pick up a Rickards taster pack (like I did) and I am willing to bet that you won't be disappointing with a majority of the Rickards line.","PorterPro125","Jul 26, 2014"

3.43,11.7,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Fetched a bottle from a Rickards mixed pack along with a Blonde. I used to drink a fair quantity of Rickards and this was probably my favorite of the brood, a brew that satisfied my craving for dark beers long before I really knew anything about dark beers. Returning to it now was prompted by a semi-sober quaff at a Halloween party and my managing to recall that there were some mellow pleasant caramel flavors lurking in there. Pours a dark reddish brown that sorta evokes a porter, but really not much else about this beer does. Its a dark mild or brown ale. Evaluation solely on the basis of style guidelines is therefore unfair, although one can fault Molson for marketing the beer as something its not. Blonde at least lands in the German pilsener ballpark. Dark is pretty foamy, probably around three inches of light tan head, and has a thinnish watery body that clashes with one's expectations. Aroma is mild, I get roasted malt, light toffee, maybe a little fruit like baked apple. I do not smell or taste much in the way of maple, which is probably just as well. Palate is light caramel/toffee, along with dry nuts and a roasted bitterness like weak cold coffee and what I swear is a light fruity note, almost citrus in character. Hmmm. Could be hops. Has the malty tang that one gets from brown ales and yes, porters. I also get a little cardboard or some other papery notes, a signature Rickards off-flavor along with metal. Make no mistake, though, the whole package is downplayed and falls well short of robust. The pleasant lingering caramel that I recalled from the aforementioned party was indeed present again and is a redeeming feature. If you shed your expectations and view this as a mild or brown rather than a porter its not too bad, if a little unsophisticated.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 07, 2013"

3.58,16.6,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Almost a clear filtered deep mahogany brown hue with a big khaki tan head, big bubbles form thick. Mild hints of coffee they mentioned a touch of maple syrup added in here, mild cocoa very pleasant mass produced porter. Flavors meld nicely a hint of cherry or other dark fruits, mild cocoa, hints of maple syrup without coming off too sweet. A bit watery maybe, I wish there were more substantial flavors but for something from Rickard's aka Molson it's pretty enjoyable and effortless to drink. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied range, with even carbonation nothing cloying on the palate a hint of roasted malt bitterness hangs around between sips. Overall I'm glad my cousin shared his sampler of the Rickard's 12 pack he got coming back from Canada. He happened to drink all of the Rickard's Blonde, happy to try the White and Dark and revisit the Red.","WVbeergeek","Oct 09, 2013"

Probably because a Porter is more marketable then a Mild Dark? I dunno, either way as a Mild Dark, just about every category would have received a .5 bump from me, which would have pushed this beer around the 4.0+ area. I like to think the Brewer intended it as such, and not as a Porter, but I suppose this should be a lesson in knowing what you are selling.

Aroma consists of light roasted malt with no bitterness and lightly sweet adjunct dominated malt profile. Taste is also a mix between some light caramel with faint roasted malt. Body is way too thin for style with medium carbonation. Pointless.","Phyl21ca","0"

3.36,9.4,4,3,3,3,4.5,"Rickards Dark poured black, like other porters, and had almost no head. There wasnt much of a smell, and the taste was the same. It was very light, and tasted watered down. Even though it was a porter it was very light, and needed much more flavor. Not a bad beer, but not a good beer either.","vette2006c5r","Apr 16, 2010"
3.06,-0.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Overall, not the worst accompaniment to a 5-napkin resto-burger, when you're not trying too hard to think about it. Another side-step from their Red Ale 'template'? Yup. Average brown ale? Sure. English porter? Hell to the no.","biboergosum","Mar 29, 2010"

3,-2.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Like most 'above average' macros, Rickard's Dark would be a good fallback beer in mainstream establishments. Certainly one of Molson's best beers, and comparable to the White, but that's not saying much. Acceptable in moments of desperation, forgettable if you want something interesting.","cratez","Jan 21, 2010"
3,-2.3,3,3,3,3,3,"473 ml can- Deep cola pour has reddish hues when held to light, pours a frothy mocha cap with good lace. Nose of roast, some burnt sugar, honey, some coffee. Tastes sweet, of brown sugar, honey, roasted malts, a bit of bitter hops. Creamy sweet finish. Good.","mrmanning","Jan 17, 2010"
3.18,3.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"If this was on tap vs. Kokanee or Canadian, then it is certainly more drinkable. Might be a decent brew to offer newbies who are 'afraid' or 'don't like' dark beers.","Shadman","Jan 08, 2010"

2.53,-17.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Like the rest of the Rickards this is a pretty bland brew. Doesn't have the presence of a proper porter. Weak kneed across the board in its aroma and flavour. Thin bodied. Just uninteresting, but not unpalatable. Meh.","TerryW","Nov 27, 2009"

2.36,-23.1,3,2,2.5,2,2.5,"This is so far from a porter, very much a "safe" beer. Non offensive, but does have some very nice maply syrup tasting notes. Dark brown in colour and not a lot of aroma but aroma is sweet with maple. Taste is again maple syrup with some malt. Beer is an easy drinking macro with really nothing of note or notable characteristics.","cfrancis","Beers"
