3.86,2.9,3.25,4,4,3.5,3.75,"Pours dark red-brown, almost black.  Only intense light permeates.  Extremely short-lived creamy-tan head.  Aroma is entirely malty.  Tastes much more like a hearty nut brown ale than other porters I've had.  Lacks the bitterness usually associated with porters and stouts (light bitterness usually achieved with coffee or cocoa nibs.)  Hop flavors almost absent.  Carbonation is mild, making for mellow sipping.  Very enjoyable.","HawbakerBrewery","Jan 11, 2015"
