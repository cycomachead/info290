4.2,9.9,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Strong aroma is malty and smoky with a firm undertone of apple and hints of molasses (should I say treacle?) and licorice. Pours a warm opaque sable that lets in a bit of light at the bottom and has a fairly thick wheat head. Mouth-filling flavor has notes of roast malt, coffee, treacle and licorice. Smooth texture has good, firm body and a fair amount of fizz, not as heavy as a stout but certainly pleasing. Let this one growl for you!","Cyberkedi","Jul 24, 2014"

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into pint glass, L1125 bottle code. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, fig, cocoa, brown bread, molasses, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, cocoa, molasses, raisin, fig, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, brown bread, cocoa, raisin, fig, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy and slightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English porter style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 10, 2013"
