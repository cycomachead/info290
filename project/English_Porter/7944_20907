2.89,-14.7,2.75,2.5,3,3.25,3,"Pours a dark brown and lets a little light through along the edges. Head is fizzy and leaves quickly, leaving decent lacing. Aroma is very light but malty. Taste is really light, really too light to be called a porter IMO. Flavors are there, just subdued and slightly watery. Mouthfeel is decent but does not have that thickness and mouth coat of a porter.","hophugger","Jan 02, 2015"
