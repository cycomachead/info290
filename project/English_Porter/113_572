Everything I look for in a Porter, just more subtle and lighter. I do not dispute the high marks given by others as this is the benchmark brew, but for those with my disposition a fair warning about subtlety.","MisterGone","Mar 31, 2015"

4.11,-1.7,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4,"550 ml bottle poured into a mug. At long last I am trying this classic. Dark chalky brown, near-black, with a moderate amount of rich creamy tan head rather like sponge toffee. Rich nose of semi-sweet chocolate, freshly turned soil, brown sugar, treacle, and a faint whiff of red berries perhaps.  Complex but not overbearing aroma notably in its earthy features. Palate is similarly earthy and vaguely sour, like cacao mixed with fruity molasses. Caramel develops on both nose and palate over the course of a few sips. Little in the way of caustic or rough bitterness despite the earthiness, which I'm thinking is hop-derived in part. Some cola-like brown spice. Smooth creamy mouth feel and moderate to thick bodied, with more of that odd chalky sourness in the semi-dry finish. Lingering caramel and raisin sweetness. Diacetyl from those those open square fermenters. Some of the written descriptions of this beer I've encountered may overstate this brew's "smoky sour" character but certainly this feature is present. I also get considerable sweetness of both dark and fruity varieties. Classic brew indeed and somehow light and mellow enough to enjoy in reasonable quantity.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 18, 2014"

I think that's due to the heavy focus on the earthen flavors, which threaten to overpower the malt at times.","UrbanCaveman","Oct 17, 2014"

Maybe a little lighter than I prefer, but hey, I'm an American spoiled on American beers. The flavors and aromas were balanced quite nicely however, and as my pallet has progressed, I've come to appreciate balance more. Not to offend anyone, but the dark fruit notes soley, remind me of Yuengling porter but turned up a few notches. The unsweetened bakers chocolate balances those notes well. This makes me want to give Fullers another try as I wasn't quite fond of it a while back. Maybe I have a soft spot for English beers after all. Only time will tell. For the meantime, this was another enjoyable offering from what is so far my favorite English brewery. Cheers!","Bone53","Jul 07, 2014"

This is a remarkably well-made beer, and although it lacks the unusual flavours or intensity of many American porter interpretations, there's always going to be room for the classics in my fridge. I still like Fuller's LP more, but this is a good replacement that no stout/porter fan should neglect to try.","thehyperduck","Apr 27, 2014"

Pours a very dark red with khaki head with some retention. Fairly mild nose but plenty of chocolate, raisin, smoke, coffee and molasses. Taste follows suit with the perfect amount of sweetness, bitter chocolate, hops and roasted notes. Not heavy and overbearing like a lot of stouts and porters, but very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Overall, terrific beer... my new baseline for what a porter should be.","Samuel906","Jun 18, 2013"

The most incredible smells fill my nostrils as a breathe in the intoxicating aroma. Toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, roasted coffee bean, hazelnut, and light biscuit notes are present. The nose on this literally resembles a fine dessert. For the flavor, that toffee aspect dominates, but yet again with Samuel Smith's, we get a fantastic level of complexity for a low ABV beer. I can pick up some bittersweet hops, dark fruits, and smokiness along with the flavors previously detected in the aroma. The mouth feel is light to medium, and the finish is dry and pleasant.

Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toast, molasses, brown bread, raisin, light roasted malt, earth, and light herbal hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; fairly light on strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, light coffee, brown bread, raisin, light nuttiness, earth, and herbal hops. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, roasted malt, light coffee, brown bread, raisin, earth, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of nicely robust flavors with good complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English porter. Very nice robustness and balance of flavors; and extremely smooth to drink.

4.7,12.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown (almost black) with a tall creamy brown head. The head actually hangs around for a while, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The nose is filled with aromas of dark roasted malt and chocolate. I picked up a hint of toffee in the smell as well. The taste absolutely follows the nose. The dark roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee flavors blend well and coat the mouth. I have to say I catch some coffee notes as well. It's not too sweet, so it's just right to make this balanced. The body is medium with a creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. The finish is pretty clean and smooth. The drinkability is very high. This is a most excellent beer.","acevenom","Sep 27, 2012"

Smell is of roasted malt, slight cocoa and coffee, and some dark fruit and port wine aromas. Taste is mildly tart and is of roasted malt, cocoa powder, caramel/toffee, and some slight dark fruit flavors. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is easy to drink but I enjoy the smell more than the taste.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 25, 2012"

Very dry and roasted in flavor with hints of chocolate, coffee, nuts, and vanilla. Bitter acidic taste in the middle. Again reminds me of bakers chocolate. The flavors are subtle but blend real well for perfect balance. The dry finish and mouthfeel is what makes this beer stand out above other outstanding porters.

Nose has some cocoa, some Sam Smith hard water/metallic notes, a creamy sweetness with even a hint of tartness. Taste has some copper, some dark fruit notes and a bit of milk chocolate and again, a shade of some tartness. Mouthfeel is medium light, with a bit of roast in the finish. Low carbonation. A nice porter, but I can't seem to get past these copper notes - it's like sucking on a penny. I've experienced this to differing degrees in Sam Smith beers, but this one (or at least this bottle) seems to have it in substantial amounts.","liamt07","Dec 30, 2011"

I'll be honest: I didn't feel that this lived up to the billing it seems to have received as one of the premiere brews of it's style. It's not a bad beer by any means, certainly enjoyable, but I didn't feel that it was the life changing end all be all of porters that it seems to have been attributed as being. Check it out.

Something about the fruit notes smell very banana like to me. The taste is creamy, has a sweet taste, almost like coffee and cream. Slightly tangy on the other side, with more of sour taste then bitter per say. Mouthfeel is solid, good carbonation, starts creamy, less so as it warms up. Overall I really like this beer, but I can't say it's something I want to drink on a normal basis. The smell and taste is a very interesting profile, and not what I was expecting.

Taste is smooth with a bit of a bitter/dry tone. Not exactly watery but the taste feels very light on the taste buds. A nice slow drinking pub kind of beer that drinks great. Very easy to see why it's called The Famous Taddy Porter.","Lemke10","Nov 10, 2011"

Not as as sturdy or robust as Fuller's London Porter this is nevertheless an excellent beer. The lack of the smokiness of this beer, which Fuller's has makes this a lighter and easier to drink but perhaps slightly less memorable British Porter. Still, this is a fine beer and quite enjoyable.","fx20736","Oct 29, 2011"

4.09,-2.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"M- The mouthfeel of this beer is long-lived. It begins with a sharp carbonation and mouthfeel quickly changes to a lingering dryness, which mimics that of a merlot or shiraz wine. The slight burnt flavor and dryness both likely arise from the roasted malts which go into this beer.","silver7447","Oct 08, 2011"

3.9,-6.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours black with an inch and a half of cream/tan colored head, really nice lacing and solid retention. Smells like creamy roasted malt, dry woodiness, faint dark fruit, dark chocolate, with some cherry and vanilla extract coming to the surface as it warms. Taste is mostly restrained roasted malt, finishing dry and slightly minerally. Light carbonation and medium-light body. Overall, this is a pretty good porter, quite drinkable but perhaps a bit one dimensional on the taste. I don't like my porters super roasty porters, and this one manages to be restrained enough to be drinkable.","pmarlowe","Sep 27, 2011"

The smell of the beer had plenty of roasted dark malts aromas and some light earthy hops aromas too. The taste of the beer was a little metallic at first buy faded nicely as the beer warmed up. The flavored of chocolate and sweet malts were dominant in this brew. The mouthfeel of the beer was creamy and rich with a good carbonation level.

4.03,-3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: My first English Porter, it reminds me a lot of a cross between an American Nut Brown and an American Porter; dark malt, chocolate and coffee mixed with more caramel, toffee, wood and nuttiness.

As the cap slowly recedes, it leaves a sheet of lacing cascading down the pint glass. The aroma has a strong chocolate presence, with some roasted malt behind. The flavor continues with a tasty chocolate character, with a hint of coffee, and a nice bready, malty finish. A really tasty beverage. I can't believe I haven't had this before. The chocolate component is perhaps a bit heavy, but overall, the flavor is pleasant. Not too sweet. I could throw back a few pints of this. I bet this is fantastic on cask.","Huhzubendah","Sep 06, 2011"

4.03,-3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Well-balanced, but not huge in the palate; there are some breweries that could learn a thing or two from old Sammy Smith. I don’t always want an extreme, flavor-fisting, palate-raping meltdown of 10%+ ABV when I’m drinking a dark beer.

4.06,-2.9,5,4,4,4,4,"My pour created just better than a finger of light-brown head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with ruby/garnet/mahogany highlights. Nose was chocolaty with a slight underlying tang. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a smoky chocolatiness to it on the tongue. Finish was quite smoky, charcoal-like in its intensity, very dry. Wow! This is probably the exemplary beer for its style, but I had forgotten its intensity as compared to a lot of the American versions. I would definitely drink it again, but not on a hot summer's day after weeding the backyard.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2011"
4.07,-2.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours black, brown on the edges, and is somewhat translucent. There is a chunky tan froth atop the brew initially, which recedes to an encircling wisp in short order. The nose is roasty and nutty with faint hints of smoke and soy sauce. There is also a plum-like dark fruitiness. The flavor delivers on the advertising of the aroma; hints of smoke are subtle yet especially impactful. Fruity notes are more subdued, nutty impressions are stronger and toastier, and there is a hint of alcohol on the finish which adds to the robust character. The feel is silky and creamy, and just what I like from the style. Overall this is a very nice brew, and a solid example of the style. Given the brewer, I'd expect nothing less.","ktrillionaire","Jun 20, 2011"

3.83,-8.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the creamy mouthfeel, helped along by the deep mocha head. As a whole this seemed to be characteristic of an “English Porter”. The slight bitterness and sourness was indicative of the style, and more specifically, something coming out of the UK. What detracted a bit for us was the overwhelming carbonation which, while it lent to the head and mouthfeel, became bothersome by the end.","TheBrewo","Apr 27, 2011"

I have yet to come across a Samuel Smith's beer that has dissapointed me. Could definitely session this. Not the best porter, wouldn't say it should be called famous, but I'd definitely call it good.","haazer","Apr 25, 2011"

4.07,-2.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"When you put "famous" on your beer's label, it better be darn good. This beer is. It's varied, well-balanced, and just really tasty (though it could do with a touch less sweetness). And with the low ABV, it's a very sessionable porter.","zeledonia","Apr 11, 2011"
4.38,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - Taddy packs a wallop of flavor without the necessity of pesky heavy alcohol our American versions have. Highly drinkable, it's a session porter if there ever was one. God bless the English brews.","BeerFMAndy","Apr 11, 2011"
3.91,-6.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O- A super easy drinking porter. If the price wasn't so high compared to many of the other great porters (about 2x oz for oz compared to Anchor Porter, SN Porter, etc.) it would be a regular purchase. Not as good as some make it out to be, but I can dig it.","jsprain1","Apr 10, 2011"
4.5,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with just enough carbonation, and the drinkability is quite good, even if it drinks like a stronger brew than 5.0% ABV. This was another great dark brew from Sam Smith.","shand","Apr 04, 2011"
4.95,18.4,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours out near black in color with a foamy brown head and a opaque blackness that is mesmerizing. It has an aroma of roasted malts, chocalate, and medicinal hops. Very nice. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, grassy grains, and medicinal hops. Mouthfeel is thick and coating and wetting. Overall this is a gorgeous beer and a best in class porter.","bigrzman","Apr 04, 2011"
5,19.6,5,5,5,5,5,"This porter has it all. "The Famous" Taddy Porter is right. This beer is creamy, smooth, tastey and down right delicious. Compared to other porters the biggest difference in this one is the mouthfeel - at times this can be a little ambiguous with beer but when this fills your mouth you will appreciate this category. The smell and taste are the perfect Goldilocks - 3 bears blend of just right. Not too much, not enough - just right.","SisuPride","Apr 03, 2011"
3.9,-6.7,4.5,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a great beer and feels brighter and lighter on the tongue than the color suggests; however, the dark brew yummy flavors are still hidden in there, so you are not "skimped"of flavor.

Tangy in the flavor, a nice balance of sweet, bitter, and slight roasty notes in the middle, finishes dry with hints of chocolate.

Slight fruity approach mixture of hops in there to balance out the semi smoked deep roasted malts that provide chocolate and some coffee tones very nice.Definitely an acquired bitterness with a pleasant array of rolling sharp sweet tones blended with the coffee and chocolate available along with a sharp ale yeast driven fruitiness. a bit thin and needs some texture","Anthony1","Mar 10, 2011"
3.93,-6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Appearance is dark brown with big off-white head. Taddy Porter smells like roasted malts, nuts and dark chocolate; very low-key.

Not much lacing left on the glass either. Coffee scents are nice but a bit weak. It's the taste where this beer stands out.

Aroma of dark fruits, plum, fig, roasted malt, slight coffee / licorice type aroma. Taste is roast and barley, with dark fruits, and some candied apple. I feel like it is hard to characterize this one with normal beer vocabulary. It's an excellent porter, which distinguishes itself from others with a unique, rich, and complex aroma / flavor.

An easy two inch, full tan/cream colored head formed after pouring into the glass and persisted for a few minutes. The aroma was fleeting, with wafts of toffee and caramel. Great, full bodied flavor I expect from a porter and makes for an easy drink as the robust flavor quickly leaves the senses, making the drinker wanting sip after sip.

Great aroma of chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, and molasses. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, toffee, licorice, caramel, molasses, butter, and spice rum.

Poured into stemmed glasses. Dark brown color. Nice white head with good lacing. The nose was a nice combination of chocolate and milky coffee. Taste was excellent. Really rich malt flavor up front, with a bittersweet chocolate flavor on the palate. Mouthfeel was also memorable, as it had a sturdy body to it, but was smooth and the abv was low enough to not be a factor. A very drinkable beer overall. This porter may not be the most flavorful beer I have ever tried, but it really seems to be one of the most authentic versions of a porter on the market.

I poured this in to a standard English pint glass. Color is chestnut brown, with a tall white head to cap things off. Deep chocolate and dark fruit dominate the smell, with some charcoal thrown in to the mix as well. Taste is full of chocolate, and more dark fruit, It also gets a bit metallic at times, which strangely enough really works for this beer. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, and drinks as easily as any beer I have ever come across. This beer reminds me of why I first fell in love with traditional English Porters. I think sometimes English Ales get a bad rap for being too mild, but this brew proves that notion wrong. Indeed, this beer could stand up to any American Porter or Baltic Porter easily.

Tasted some faint bitter chocolate and malt but the coffee was what really stood out to me with this guy. This was very sweet i thought, balanced and some dark fruit. It was alot lighter than i guess i figured it would be which is usually the case, i could drink motor oil sludge and still think its too light haha. Very drinkable/tastey straight forward porter though and if i was a coffee drinker which im not, id much rather have one of these in the morning with breakfast for sure, and with only a good 5% ABV it certainly wouldnt be a problem.","BeerMasterD","Jan 29, 2010"

4.45,6.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"A simple, excellent porter with a delightfully sudsy feel. This beer pours a very dark ruby with a big sudsy head that sticks around and coats the glass well. The smell is sweet with sugary malt and doesn't reach the same fullness found in the taste. The taste is restrained but complex. There is nice hop bitterness around the edges of a healthy malt backbone. There is a good deal of the earthy, musty flavor that marks porters, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it. The feel is almost exactly what I want out of a porter; suds build at the slightest movements. It is an immensely drinkable beer and I can certainly imagine spending a long evening drinking glasses of it in an English pub. I've been avoiding this beer for a little while as I'm not the biggest fan of porters or Sam Smith's beers, but the Taddy Porter has me changing my tune for the better.","popery","Nov 24, 2008"

The nose was really interesting as the first thing that hit me was soy sauce, which brought to mind the Pardubický Porter, however there were also light coffee hints and eventually something which brought to mind the kelp beds on the beaches back at home, which I am assuming was from the seaweed finings used in production. The pre-dominant flavour though was of caramelised bananas, one of my favourite desserts, as well as dark chocolate and a light coffee taste.","velkyal","Nov 12, 2008"

The taste is so very smooth and mellow but is probably the most complex thing I've ever had. It would take several sessions to sort out all the flavors, but there's a malty spine of roasted Things that is incredibly attractive. It's rather filling; I had half the bottle one evening, sealed the remainder with a vacu-vin and finished it the next night.

This does makes sense to me though, the historical porter was originally a blend of three beers, a stale one, a mild and, a pale. Seems to me like there was a good chance the final product would have very little carbonation due to the stale, not to mention these were all real ales and cask conditioned to mention meaning they would have less carbonation to begin with. I believe that the mouthfeel on this engineered porter is just about perfect, seems to be very accurate according to descriptions. This is one drinkable beer, great to session. Prolly the best English porter I've ever had, well at least to date. Real impressed with this one, I will be coming back to it.

The flavors are subtle but noticeable, with chocolate, a bit of caramel, and a hint of mocha present. Smooth and with just the right amount of carbonation, Taddy Porter is easy on the palate, while accosting the taste buds with a multitude of flavors.

Mighty thick, in a good way. And so smooooth. Velvetly almost. Finally, the taste was rich and strong; the actual coffee taste is somewhat stronger than the smell.

Very well balanced, slightly malty and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, velvety, light carbonation.

There's also some intense caramel and light fruitiness floating about. The taste is bitter-sweet, nutty, and roasted, with only the barest hints of coffee floating about. Ok, some chocolate too, but I didn't notice at first. The earthiness here is probably from some very nice hopping. A bit of acid too, and some butteriness.

By letting it sit for a while, I can get some roasted caramel flavors and some hops but I can't totally get the skunkiness out of my nose. Taste is roasted and nutty with some coffee and chocolate notes as well, and if I could keep the skunkiness out of my nose would be spectacular. Finish is smokey and dry. Slightly slick mouthfeel.

Tastes mild actually, good flavor, lightly roasted, sweet and caramelly to match, not at all harsh, with a lingering finish that is hop and malt balanced. Yet just slightly stale and not quite fresh tasting for some reason. It may in fact have been on the shelves a while. Mouthfeel is where this is lacking. Carbonation seems very artificial and a seperate part here like a soda, not in quantity but quality of its feel on the tounge, and it is also watery, which may be a factor. Overall this beer is the reason why I gave porters a chance and look foward to a good porter more than any other style. If it were priced better, I'd drink one a day. I'll stick with anchor for special drinking or something lighter for refreshment (which this in fact acomplishes well, surprisingly) but this is an excellent beer.","Liquids","Jul 14, 2006"

But the taste is where this porter shines. By far one of the best porters I've had, this really combines all the different facets of a porter to make one of the best porters around.

The taste was dominated by malt & fruit derived sweetness. Smoked and burnt wood flavors add depth to the beer, but also seem out-of-place in that they don't work with the other flavors.

There is some toffee and burnt malt flavors that are nice, but nothing really stands out and makes things interesting. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent porter. At 5% ABV it could make for a very sessionable beer if it had something flavor wise to entertain.

The aftertaste is of smoked malt, black patent and drying english hops. The uncommon charred flavor seems off-balance especially for the english version of porter and tastes more like a milk/sweet stout!

Huge toasted malts giving a hefty wallop of bittersweet chocolate, followed then by toffee, oak and molasses. It really turns sweet as it heads toward the finish. The finish is quite long, and while the big malt flavor linger to the end theyre accompanied by a light citrus bitterness that add balance, crispness and closure.

Taste is also less robust than I would have imagined - malty up front, not so much in the roasted coffee or dark chocolate I would expect from a "porter", more on the milky sweet side, and finishing with apple skins and cider. Not much of a hop presence, but enough to balance and prevent it from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, if not a little on the thin side, but drinkability is way up there - definitely session material.

It is fairly bitter on the palate from both the hops and roasted malts, and there are notes of apples, raisins, coffee, chocolate, anise, dark fruits, green hops and a malty sweetness.

Each sip leaves a chunky stratum of lace. Beer is a sheen of mahogany blackness with merlot-colored highlights. Luxurious aromas of fudgy chocolate brownies, heady dark caramel creams, chocolate chip cheesecake, and puff pastries flaking apart in drawn butter are interwoven by vinous, sweet sherry tones in a dank, moist, and cakey nosefeel. Big sweet tastes of brown sugar-tinged molasses roll into the midpalate, developing body of dark chocolate and huge crystals of toffee and butter. Second half of the palate rounds out into bitter almonds, pipe tobacco, and a finish of old, dry leather. A slight acidity at the sides of the mouth is the only thing keeping this from being a "5." It's that close. Lightly dextrinous mouthfeel as of melted chocolate bars arcs across the tongue in a parabola of sweet, soft and bitter. Drinkable? I mean, come on...

Aromas are very muted and tough to pick out, even when warmed to near room temperature. Whiffs of chocolate, caramel, vanilla?, and even some smoked dark fruit are noted. Flavor is not a robust as I'd expected. Perhaps I am unfairly judging this style (the first "English Porter" I've sampled), but it just didn't strike me as that tasty. There's the usual suspects of choclate, some cocoa powder, a dash of bittering hops, and some caramel, but nothing astounding. Mouthfeel was on the thinner side as well.

4.12,-1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark mollasses brown and black, with a great deal of thick, reddish brown head and stringy sticky lacing. The aroma is very rich, with many nuances. It is somewhat similar to Samuel Smith's other beer Oatmeal Stout, both in aroma and taste: the difference is that Oatmeal Stout is much sweeter. Coffee, chocolate, subtle fruits, vanilla, cream, raisins, and even slight spicy notes greet the nose. The aroma even carries some smells more common in fruit brandies . The smell, to me, is the outstanding characteristic of this beer. The taste is balanced well, sweet yet dry. Initially it has a crisp sweet syrup flavour, but gives way to a coffee-like dryness in the finish; and the middle is where you taste the medium alcohol presence. There seems to be a slight oak taste on the front of the tongue; yes, definite wood flavours slowly reveal themselves upon subsequent sips. I sense a strong graininess on the palate, almost as if there are coffee grains in the beer, and it adds delightfully to the character of the brew. The taste lingers on the mouth for quite some while, which makes this a highly drinkable and sociable beer: relax after dinner with one, slowly sipping and savouring. As a classic, this is not meant to be consumed rapidly.","Cwrw","Mar 12, 2004"

But the taste was where this beer really shined. Toasted burnt malts, dark espresso and buttery toffee. Especially the nutty, buttery toffee flavors. Amazing. Very well balanced with the hops. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised in a while. Something about that toffee flavor just got me, I was in love. And I rarely drink Porters.

Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, carbonation just barely adequate. Taste was much like the nose, but with some interesting twists that made for one of the best tasting dark beers I've ever tried. There's definitely a hint of cherries in this, and the twang of those funky English hops. I can't decide if it's licorice or cinamon, or some other bittersweet spice, but there's something here that melds perfectly with the chocolately malts, cherry fruitiness, and buttery walnut to produce an exceptional flavor profile. Just enough bittering hops to balance the many other flavors going on in this fine porter. Finishes smooth, and goes down so fine. High drinkability with the low abv.

The aromas that came from the glass were fairly simple, which is nice, smells of coffees, chocolate and some rich dark malt. Classic. The tastes that I experienced were of coffee and hints of chocolate in the beginning, then slowly caramel notes came forth, then dark malts, then as it finished more combo of coffee , chocolate, and hints of dark fruits as it ended. The aftertaste was on the dry side, with combined flavors of malt and coffee. The body was medium. This is a classic beer, well represents its style.

Wow - the aroma would fare well against my favorite dark Belgians. Sure, the dark chocolate is there in good balance with roasted coffee beans, but the great parts are the esters and the hops. The dark cherries meld perfectly with the earthy hops. Unfortunately I find the flavor to be a let-down after such an aroma. It is rather bland roasted malts with a slight acidic twinge and butteriness at the end. Not bad, but not anything special. The carbonation feels a little rough on the tongue, and the body is thin. I think I pick up some higher/fusel alcohols. I have a feeling this beer would be devastatingly good on cask, but as far as out of a bottle, it is just above average.","waughbrew","Jan 25, 2004"
3.58,-14.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick tan head. The aroma is decent, but a bit on the dark side. It is full of roasted and black malts; a hearty porter. The taste is good. It has an elevated abv. taste with black malt flavor and a creamy finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent porter; definately not my favorite. I just can't get into these super black porters.","WesWes","Jan 20, 2004"

The smell of roasted malts is what first filled the nose and was very pleasant. The taste was a creamy delight with the flavor of roasted barley malts and a nice balance of simi sweet chocolate on the finish. Overall, this porter was full in body and packed with flavor. Intense, dry tangy character of roasted barley and chocolate.","BeerManDan","Jan 14, 2004"
4.4,5.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This one was instantly one of my favourites. I love this style and this one in particular was no exception. Poured quite dark, somewhere between coffee and old motor oil. Brown head dissolves quickly. Smells almost like it tastes. Smoothness due in part to the lack of carbonation as there is almost none to speak of. Taste is very pronounced coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Quite malty indeed. I detect a bit of nutiness, perhaps an almond like flavour as well. The only reason I gave drinkability 4,0 as oppossed to 4,5 is because this is a bit heavy, and I can easily see where after 3 of these (keep in mind I'm drinking the ,550 litre size) one would certainly have his or her fill of this wonderful brew, at least for a while. Nevertheless, this is marvelous stuff.","SilentSabre","Jan 12, 2004"

In addition to the expected coffee aromas, it presented a bit of a winey smell that was surprising but not unpleasant. The taste is a thoroughly enjoyable mix of coffee, hints of chocolate, and just a bit of hop bitterness. Drinkability? This is an all-day beer.","mickeymac","Jan 11, 2004"

I didnt pick up as much sweetness in the taste this time around, but I got some good (albeit light) brown sugar and a twang of rising yeast. Its definitely a solid medium in the body and was a little too clumsy to be called a session brew.

It actually taste alot like a whete beer or lager, where the malts, whetes and a little hops are more present. The malted grains prevail the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it becomes less noticible and as you continue to drink it the substance becomes more evident. The carbonation is perfect.","FranklinPCombs","Dec 30, 2003"

The aroma is a combination: first, of a garden in early fall, after the harvest, when the dirt has been uprooted, mixed with burning maples in the air. The taste is smooth, smooth, smooth, and there's a balanced floral/coffee/chocolate maltiness. This ale has a silky mouthfeel, which is just a tad (pardon the pun) thin.

Dark brown/black with a tan head. Not a very strong nose. Smells lightly of buttery coffee and chocolate. Flavor is rather flat, and not what I expected. Coffee and slightly acidic, although it has a fairly smooth mouthfeel. Call me crazy, but I just didn't care for this too much.","Admiraldinty","Oct 22, 2003"

The pour produced a light brown fluffy head that slowly shrank to a thin layer covering the top of the beer and the sides of the glass. The smell is mostly of roasted grains. The beer feels light and bubbly as it rolls accross my tongue. The taste is nothing extraordinary, smooth roasted malts on the way down, a very slight coffee kind of aftertaste on the back of the throat.

The just nearly black liquid looked somewhat clear, though there was no alteration in color as I drank, or held it to different light. Aroma was almost nil, just a slight smoked peat smell. Taste followed up on the smokey note with a mouth full of darkened and dry malts. A nice rich flavor that would beat single malt any day.

Aroma is strong of english hops, almost a bit like tea, and caramel malt. This is a pretty tasty beer, although it's hard to put my finger on any one flavor. There is definitely a burnt roastyness. The hops kind of balance this out so it's not too heavy in taste. There is also a very slight plum taste in there, really all sorts of very delicate fruits. The kicker for me is the finish, which is smooth & buttery like most sammy smith ales. Good carbonation, but it kind of detracts from what would be a velvety mouthfeel.

Espresso comes in slightly but then backs out. Chocolate takes control shows itself in a powerful way. Hops and an acidic quality are there just before the finish.

The flavor reflects the nose with mildly sweet caramel; fruit that's a touch winey with red grape, raisins, and berries; milk chocolate; and some rounding buttery diacetyl backed by a solid bitterness.

There was a bit of a head to it, but it died down to a thin laceing. The smell was that of a roasted coffee.

At palate entry, cedary and fruity (almost citrus) hops, followed by roasted malt sweetness and an oakey earthiness. A nice, creamy mouthfeel throughout. The finish is tart and dry. A very smooth and characterful porter from one of the world's great breweries.","Riggo","Jan 28, 2003"

Mouthfeel is velvety and covers toung like a flanel blanket. Flavors are dry and complex with tart dark roasted esspresso and malt balls. It has an earthy body that really fills your mouth with it's robust flavors.

Smooth, well-rounded, a porter full of character, that will remain on the top of my list until the end of time. Absolutely perfect. Light enough in alcohol to stand in as a session beer (but too expensive to actually work that way), and with plenty of body and bite.","feloniousmonk","Jan 04, 2003"

Just alot of roasted malt goodness, the usual chocolate/caramel/coffee tones that I seem to pick out of every non hop dominated beer I ever drink.

4.4,5.3,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Taste is exceedingly smooth with a lightly roasted/toasted malty taste, like the nose, hints of chocolate, coffee and slate. Probably the brewing method (slate lined boxes thing they do) or real hard water contributes to mineral or flinty quality I find in all Sam Smiths wonderful beers. It works especially well with the Taddy Porter as I felt this "hardness" of the water balanced the roasted malt quality really well. It cut through it like a knife and made the porter very smooth and nicely drinkable. The finish was rich and clean with some dryness and earth. Great silky mouthfeel, is one of the best characteristics of this porter.","bmills1608","Nov 18, 2002"

A solid porter in every way!","frank4sail","Nov 06, 2002"

4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Though not my personal favorite, this porter definitely has its merits.  Pouring a deep dark brown with a prominent creamy tan head, this brew possesses the trademark Samuel Smith's aroma with just a hint of dark malts.  The smooth medium-plus body supports a malty flavor with a noticeable smoky chocolate overtone.  The grassy hop finish is a nice contrast to the smoky dark malts.  Quite tasty.","beernut7","Oct 11, 2002"

It's exactly what the style brings to mind.","Suds","Sep 20, 2002"
4.27,2.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a creamy tan head. The color yields some reddish tints when held to the light. The lacing is impressive. The nose is of roasted malt, coffee and licorice. The taste is more of the roasted goodness and a bit of hazelnut lurks beneath. There are also hints of dark chocolate, but they are very subdued. The mouthfeel is smooth, albeit a tad (no pun intended) bit thin for my preference. Drinkability is good, as this is a pretty easy-drinking porter. A choice offering from Sammy Smith.","Jon","Sep 11, 2002"

The malt is firm on the palate. Light caramel notes, thick roasted malt flavor, followed by a rich coffee bitterness.  I detected a faint taste of grapes and plums. Finish is slightly chocolately, leading to a long, bitter, malty, coffee aftertaste. I found this beer to be slightly flat and dangerously close to being thin.
