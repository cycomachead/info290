4.19,0.2,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"I really liked this one. A little too drinkable to me. A bit thin in the flavor arena (my New World bias and San Diego upbringing clouding my judgement?). Everything I look for in a Porter, just more subtle and lighter. I do not dispute the high marks given by others as this is the benchmark brew, but for those with my disposition a fair warning about subtlety.","MisterGone","Mar 23, 2015"

It begins with a blended flavor that is tart and separates into light notes of roast and coffee and just a hint of chocolate.  The middle introduces a slight sweetness underneath.  As the sweetness fades, dark fruit is present.","tillmac62","Mar 19, 2015"
