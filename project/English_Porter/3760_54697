It looks great, smells like vanilla extract, and has a robust roasted malt backbone. The aroma is a bit too sweet for my liking, but it manages to complement the porter in an odd way. The mouthfeel is  delightful, but the overall experience is a bit off.","Bunman3","Feb 21, 2015"

At first, I thought that the flower on the can was a banana, but on second glance I realized that I was wrong.  I drank this porter wearing pyjamas, so I would have loved to have bananas in pyjamas. My dream was crushed upon drinking this brew. I did not take into account my fantasy in my review and rating of this brew.","bendythumb","Jan 25, 2015"

3.99,11.8,4.5,3,4.25,4.5,4.25,"O: [4.25] I have had Mill Streets Cobblestone Irish Stout.  This tastes very similar but with a nice infusion of vanilla.  This would go really well with desserts - and maybe even with ice cream right in it.  The body is so smooth and the beer goes down really easily.  Other than a synthetic smell on the nose this beer hits on all cylinders.  I really like it as a approachable low abv beer.","fscottkey","Dec 22, 2014"

3.46,-3.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,"I was expecting more carbonation, this beer seems to be a little flat for me.  I am comparing it to of course one of my favorite drinks, vanilla coke, and so I was a little disappointed.  I would not order another one of these, but it does the trick for the time being and I have had alot worst.  It has a nice head to it, and pours smoothe.  You can down it pretty easily but it doesn't really have a nice smell ( a little overwhelming.)  In my opinion the BA score was a little high but I guess they have their reasons.","Jonathan33373","Dec 08, 2014"
