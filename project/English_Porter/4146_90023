3.38,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.25,"Peanut Butter Cup Porter is not what I thought it would be. A peanut butter porter would have been fine; sweet, somewhat nutty, easy to drink. Actually, the beer does meet these prerequisites. However, the fruity ester note from the aroma is the first thing I get from the beer's taste. Melded together, the flavor is okay, and it does retain an easy drinking behavior, but whether it's tap lines or the beer itself, my sample was not what I was expeting.","DoubleJ","Dec 16, 2014"
