I get all the dark toast and caramel notes from the nose plus a light roasted almond like nutty taste. It’s palate feels smooth, a little slick but it’s light enough to keep from being cloying.","generallee","Mar 25, 2014"

Not a bad marketing plan, because you will find one or more of their products you will want badly.","timfelix","Sep 18, 2013"
