4.34,7.2,4,4.25,4.5,3.75,4.5,"About as close to a session barrel-aged dark beer as you can get. Really impressive how they can cram in a ton of flavor to a lower abv porter. Of course, it's not as thick or bourbon forward as a lot of big BA stouts and porters, but that's not what it's trying to be at all. For what it's trying to be, it's damn near perfect.","GreesyFizeek",
