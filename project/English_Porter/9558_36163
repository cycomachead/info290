Of course, it's not as thick or bourbon forward as a lot of big BA stouts and porters, but that's not what it's trying to be at all. For what it's trying to be, it's damn near perfect.","GreesyFizeek","Aug 07, 2013"

Body is medium and smooth. Caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, whisky and hint of hops combine on the palate. Finish is long and semi-dry. Interesting tasty porter.","mikeg67","Nov 27, 2012"

4.08,0.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The body is medium, and the highly alcoholic aspect manages to stop short of astringency, which can be a problem with aging a beer in a barrel of something like whiskey. It's just crisp enough and flows just smoothly enough to make for easy sipping.","Brenden","Sep 10, 2011"
3.86,-4.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Got this as an extra from a trading partner. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. This brew pours a 95% opaque black two finger head, thanks to a SDTM pour. The bourbon's faintly noticeable, but there's a decent amount of coffee in the nose. The taste isn't domintated by the bourbon, but it's there, and it's a nice addition. There's a lot of coffee, vanilla, and toasted malt in the flavor. Really a good mix. The mouthfeel is a bit on the astringent side, but it's not overbearing. Finishes off smooth, leaving the bourbon behind. Very decent beer. Would have again.","Retail1LO","Aug 24, 2011"
3.85,-4.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"D - Surprisingly solid beer. It'd be hard to drink a bomber of this on your own, even though it's fairly low in ABV. Still, it was plenty enjoyable for 8-12oz.","MasterSki","Aug 13, 2011"
3.76,-7.2,4,3,4,4,4,"Light whiskey notes over modestly roasted malts, with a lingering sweetness that never gets overpowering, really tasty.

4.62,14.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked up a growler while visiting family. This is one of my favorite beers, by far. Poured in a pint glass, the beer is an extremely dark brown coloring, almost black in the deepest points. The brew starts with a thick, chunky, airy head that starts around three inches and quickly settles into a thin film. Good level of bubbles throughout the brew, and there is a decent lacing on the glass. Nose is extremely robust and round, with a strong mocha chocolate backbone, a hint of coffee bitter, and a good overtone of rich vanilla from the barrel aging. Flavor is coffee initially, with a rich, creamy vanilla and whiskey hue, and a touch of bittersweet chocolate. Body stays rich and creamy throughout, with a great feel for the flavors. The aftertaste is roasted coffee and chocolate, and the finish is creamy and slick. Tremendous brew!","GarthDanielson","0"

3.99,-1.5,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Overall, this might be the closest thing to a barrel aged session beer I've ever encountered. The short time spent in barrels here added just a little extra dimension to a pretty good tasting base beer. This isn't even in the same neighborhood as the more gigantic barrel bombs I'm familiar with. A nice diversion, especially if Brown's wanted to bulk up the body just a bit.","EricCioe","Apr 12, 2011"

4.04,-0.2,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: A very drinkable BA-ed porter. It succeeds at both being a decent porter and at integrating the barrel flavors without white-washing the beer. Not an "extreme" barrel-aged brew, but a nice one for sure.","SFLpunk","Jan 16, 2011"

3.33,-17.8,4.5,4,2.5,4,3.5,"Pours a nice deep dark almost black colored brown with a small yet ample off white head. Really had a nice porter look to it. There is also a big whiskey barrel aroma, some scotch like vanilla characters in it that make this really inviting for the winter and colder months. Big maple roasted malts also. The flavor is a little off and tastes a bit of infection because of a sour cherry component it gets. Really nice on the palate as it's light bodied but off balanced and disjointed on the flavors. I get a little bit of whiskey and porter like qualities, but the cherry flavor puts this off. Tangy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice as this is perfectly low carbonated as should be a porter. I would like to revisit this, especially in troy at the brew pub fresh and on draft. Nice beer but not doing it like I thought it would.","Augustiner719","Jun 21, 2010"

The aroma was surprisingly subtle, roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of whiskey barrel wood. The flavors were damn tasty, full or roasted malt, chocolate malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, whiskey, wood and hints of vanilla. The sweeter notes lead me to believe the whiskey used was bourbon and the bite of the bourbon really came through.

Aroma is sweet and boozy. Taste is a quick whiskey character to start along with ample dark sweetness, dark fruitiness in the middle, and closes with a lightly boozy tartness. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with the tart prickles, and drinkability is good. Very interesting brew, I'd like it better without the tart, but there it is.","ppoitras","0"
