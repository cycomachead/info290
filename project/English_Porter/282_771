Aroma and Taste is of dark roasted chocolate malt, caramel, dark fruit esters, even some dark berry notes mixed in as well, yeast and mild bitterness on the end from the dark roasted malt. A smooth medium body with mild carbonation. The finish is sweet dark roasted chocolate malt, caramel, dark fruit and berries with mild dry bitter roasted ending with lingering chocolate and caramel flavors. Overall a very delightful, tasty and enjoyable English Porter. very nice.","Samp01","Apr 27, 2014"

The aroma and flavour are pleasant - dominated by roasted grain and fruity malt. Intriguingly the aroma is rather muted. Body is alright. A well-crafted porter but a tad underwhelming. Perhaps this bottle is just too old? I'll try and re-review at some point. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Jun 30, 2013"
