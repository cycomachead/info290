4.17,9.2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Twelve ounce bottle. Clear dark brown with a light n brown head. Good lacing. Nose has molasses, dark brown bread. Fruity yeast. Taste is rich with malt and molasses. Fruity yeast flows into mild hoppiness. A bit of mineral, no alcohol anywhere.  Smooth full carbonation with moderate weight. One of my my favorite porters.","scootny","Mar 02, 2015"

4.18,9.4,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"This is a fairly strong, dark porter with a nice, rugged brownish head and good lacing.  I liked the maltiness and full body.  Not a bad choice, served on tap for Valentine's Day (and on Presidents' Day weekend).  I would definitely get it again.","Doctor_Bogenbroom",
