Taste is rich in chocolate and coffee, nice balance between the two. Mouthfeel is excellent, chewy, chocolatey with the right amount of carbonation..One of the better beers I have had from this brewery !","hophugger","Oct 30, 2014"

The nose is similarly off, reminding me more of sour milk than dark ale. I'm willing to try another one at some point, but this was one I poured out.","fountainofyouth","Jan 24, 2014"
