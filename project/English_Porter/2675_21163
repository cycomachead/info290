The backbone of the flavour is a pleasant combination of hot chocolate powder and malt, with hints of raisin popping up. It finishes nicely - dry and lingering, without being too sweet. Phillips is a wonderful brewery and this is certainly one of their flagship beers.","Bunman3","Dec 23, 2014"

3.91,3.7,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"Pours a nice rich dark brown with a mousse like tan head that sticks to the glass. Rich chocolate and vanilla nose with much the same coming out on the tongue. It a mildly thick mouth-feel with very little carbonation. A nice sipping beer.","Svingjo","Dec 13, 2014"
