3.83,4.4,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a jet black coloring with hazelnut highlights, and a frothy, low profile, light tan head. Nose of cocoa nibs, roasted coffee, and subtle cream highlights. Flavors are roasted and bitter cocoa nib forward, with a bitter coffee undertone. Thin, dry body, with a bittersweet aftertaste. The finish is heavily roasted, lingering on a dry, smooth feel. Solid representation of the Porter style.","GarthDanielson","Jun 13, 2014"

3.32,-9.5,3.75,3.5,3.25,3,3.25,"Atmosphere is okay. Fair head, and some light lacing. Nose is characteristic of the style... coffee and chocolate most notably. Roasted malt, with some unusual fruity sweetness and a bit of unwelcome pungency. Overall, this is an okay quaff.","bmwats",
