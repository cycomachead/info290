Taste is not pleasant, not going to be able to finish my portion of the bottle.  Feel is what you would expect based off the look.  Overall not good.","tim007007","Jan 10, 2015"

4.55,20.4,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"This is a highly underrated beer in my opinion.  Pours a dark brown, with some brownish red hues coming through the glass when held up to the light.  I do notpickup a lot of coffee in the smell, more of the roasted malt.  The taste however is where I was blown away.  The coffee was present, but did not dominate.  At first, I tasted a nice burnt caramel that blended into a malty seetness.  Towards the end of the glass, I noticed a nice biscuity/toasty flavor.  I was very impressed with this beer, and will pick it up again.","gibgink","Dec 16, 2014"
3.77,-0.3,4.25,3.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Great stuff from Meantime here, a very nice coffee porter that was full of flavour from the start with a lots of coffee present throughout, you wouldn't really expect anything else though given the name. The beer proved an easy one to finish with a nice touch of bitterness right at the end to see things out.","flyingpig","Dec 15, 2014"
