3.56,-7.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown with some ruby on the bottom, little lacing.  Smells of chocolate, toffee and faint coffee.  Taste is initially herbal bitterness upfront then followed by dark malt, some chocolate and slight coffee notes. More carbonation than expected for a porter.  Overall bottle description accurate but more bitterness than other english style porters that I had.","KM_Seahawk","Feb 26, 2015"
3.42,-11.2,4,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Dark almost black but ruby highlights at the bottom.. Tan head with spotty lace.. A/T typical porter.. Dark roasted malt, slight chocolate, bitter roast, kinda watery with a metallic veggie finish.. Will finish the six pack with no problem but problay won't get it again.","DrewsBrews450","Feb 26, 2015"
3.77,-2.1,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"This is a quality beer and the description is just about 100% accurate. Carbonation seems a little high, head fades but comes back quickly with a little swirl. I would like to give this beer a chance to get to room temperature next time, I think the flavors would mellow together. Sweetness is different, English style toffee. Well worth a try or a 6 pack.","hotpauko","Feb 26, 2015"
