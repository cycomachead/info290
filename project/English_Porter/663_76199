3.24,0.6,3.5,3.25,3.25,3,3.25,"The nose is quite remarkable albeit it inappropriate at times. Chocolate syrup, molasses, maple, dry barley, plums and soy sauce. The flavor has a very dry chocolate malt, burnt coffee, charred embers, barley grain and a strange sweetness I can't identify. Not bad for the price but not great as well.","KYGunner","Mar 04, 2015"

Aroma of light chocolate and roasted malt notes is enjoyable. Taste is a mix of chocolate malt with some roasted malt notes with some light dry finish. Body is light with good carbonation. A bit short on complexity but well drinkable.","Phyl21ca","Jan 01, 2015"

3.27,1.6,3.25,3,3.25,4,3.25,"Deep, chocolate brown color with average head and decent lacing. Aroma is light, with malt sweetness being the dominant smell. Taste surprised me a bit, was expecting a little bolder flavor, but got a little less. Ok taste with malt being the highlight, and some roastiness also. Seems to be little weak for a porter. Mouthfeel was good, nice carbonation and such. A little weak and watery for a good strong porter.","hophugger","Nov 17, 2014"
3.18,-1.2,3.75,3.25,3,3.25,3.25,"Cola brown body, 2 finger head (bubbly), average retention with good hanging lacing. Roasted aroma; flavor has a fruit profile to it mixed with coffee which makes it awkard to my taste. Bit of a coal like feel and the body is thin. Overall a less than middle of the road porter.","papat444","Nov 11, 2014"
