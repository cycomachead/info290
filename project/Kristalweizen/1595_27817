3.29,9.7,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall: I actually prefer this version rather than the kristals from Germany, though I think that is due to my hatred of kristals to begin with. At least this one has some taste to it, but I do wish they would classify it as a pilsner or something. quite refreshing and not bad at AU$51 a case (2013).","SmashPants","May 29, 2013"

2.24,-25.3,3.5,2,2,3.5,2,"This is nowhere near a Kristalweisen, more a euro-lager and really not too different to Pure(!). Not good. Methinks Cascade have dropped the standards over the years. Second Cascade tonight which has missed the mark - by a long way...","heygeebee","Aug 16, 2011"

2.66,-11.3,3,2,3,3,2.5,"Very clear light yellow (blond?). Heaps of bubbles in the glass; soft drink-like. Nose has some character, faintly spicy with some aromatics. A bit of a surprise in the mouthâ€¦.more herbally hoppy notes and spice, a little reminisce of a German hefe (but only just). Essentially light bodied but some credit must to the Cascade for the slight deviation from the norm.","Stew41","May 23, 2009"

3.53,17.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A good choice for a hot day and , as it is freely available it should be a more frequent choice","jarmby1711","Oct 17, 2006"
3.55,18.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a light straw color with some bubbly head that fades away fairly quickly. Smells a little yeasty, and slightly flowery. Tastes very clean, some sweetness, a little hoppy bitterness on the backend. The mouthfeel is very bubbly but not harsh,. Finishes a little sour, but not bad. All in all, it's a very nice blonde. I would definitely get it again, especially for a hot day.","Kulrak","Apr 06, 2006"
2.81,-6.3,3,2,3,3.5,3,"It is a very pale straw colour with a moderately lasting frothy head, good lacing. There is little aroma, although some hops detectable. The taste is of citrus hops, with a pleasant but subdued bitterness. Carbonation is well managed. I think of it as being quite a pleasant lager. A nice summer drink.","norwichboy","Jan 13, 2006"
3.88,29.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall a good refreshing beer without a lot to it. No faults and a good balance. I would not classify it as a kristallweizen though, perhaps an american wheat.","goodbyesoberday","Beers"
3.23,7.7,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Drinkability/Overall: Had this on tap at cascade brewery and in a bottle. Both were nice experiences. Definitely not a genuine wheat beer. More like a larger cross wheat beer. Pretty average, but hits the spot on a hot day.","Finite","0"
