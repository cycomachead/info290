2.16,-28,3,2,2.25,2,2,"So I've seen and heard about this beer quite often. I finally tried it and I really wanted to like it. However, this was just a deplorable attempt by Leinenkugal. The appearance is ok with not much of a head and no real lacing but the color may lead you to believe the are some layers of flavor in the glass. The scent is an overwhelming aroma of corn and every other type of cheap filler you can think. Call the smell rancid, skunky or just flat out cheap...it wasn't pleasant. The taste is so disappointing. I can't say it's too horrible as you can drink it...if your Nicholas Cage in "Leaving Las Vegas" and need a "fix" but the corn and grassiness hits you right of the bat and you then quickly get some nasty honey flavor. In my opinion there is balance here and it's all bad! The mouth-feel reminds me of tap beer from rusty pipes in a dive bar. Avoid this one! It's too bad , some of Leinenkugal's stuff isn't bad, but they crashed and burned on this one.","Khad","Nov 15, 2013"

Let's see how things go today: It pours a clear golden-straw topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-buttered biscuit, light wheat, and the lightest kiss of dried honey (which, admittedly, might just be there due to advertising getting the better of me). The taste brings in more of the same, with less of a buttery quality and more of a sweet one. It helps, but it doesn't elevate matters too far. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay beer at best, nothing close to special, but strangely drinkable enough...","TMoney2591","Feb 12, 2013"

2.91,-3,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"12oz bottle out of a summer sampler, pours golden with excellent clarity, bubbly white head with decent retention and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas are muted but sweet with wheat and biscuit, but that's about it. Tastes are sweet honey, biscuity, nutty, wheaty, delicately hopped. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and finishes slightly dry. Overall, I think "Kristalweizen" isn't the proper style category for this one, as I would tend to think Kristalweizen = filtered German Hefeweizen, where this beer has no German influence at all. Kristal American Pale Wheat Ale? Whatever it may be, my values above represent it as an American wheat, and it's a decent beer if you want to think of it that way.","barnzy78","Jun 23, 2012"

Aroma is minimal very muted sharp wheat notes with little to no citrus or honey notes. Thin body easy to sip on but the wheat notes give it some actual nice breadiness, I don't get much in the way of honey on the palate, a bit of hash grainy character in the finish. A touch of fruit, maybe at this point I will call it citrus. Mouthfeel has heavy carbonation but a lighter body, adding to some unnatural effervescence.

This beer tastes of the herbal honey notes along with very little hop bitterness and a sweet malt backbone. This is a bit lighter than the beers I've been drinking lately so it's a very nice thirst quencher and drinks very easily. This is the first and only kellerweis I have tried but it is a pleasant one.

Color was like liquid sunshine in a glass. Beautiful! Deep golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. King Midas would have been envious of the gold. Nose was very malty sweet. As a previous reviewer put it very succinctly - it smelled like being on a tour of the brewery! Dig that! I like brewery tours, BTW. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a wheat beer taste initially, followed by a lingering honey taste on the finish. Man, this was very tasty and a definite CANdidate for the imaginary cooler that I am continually filling for a beach outing. MUCH better than their Summer Shandy, which just begs to be blended with Furthermore's Knot Stock to become a Lemon Pepper Beer.

3.05,1.7,2.5,2.5,3,4,3.5,"This brew poured a white foamy head. There was very little lacing on the sides of my glass. It had a honey aroma to it. There was carbonation rising to the top. There was no bitterness or aftertaste to this brew. This is not a brew that will be at the top of my list of favorite brews.","hotstuff","May 08, 2003"
3.1,3.3,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours to a clear, brilliant straw color with a white head that quickly diminishes. The aroma is semi-sweet, with a touch of honey and a bit of grain. The flavor is light, with a barely noticeable touch of honey. It has a grainy flavor as well. It is light in body, smooth and easy drinking. A good session beer.","BeerBuilder","May 01, 2003"
2.88,-4,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Light golden yellow in color, with a good white head, some what lacey. Smells of grassy hops and grains, somewhat citrusy lemon-like, with just a hint of the honey. Taste is a bit watery with a good hop dryness and a touch of honey and lemon. You could easily drink a ton of these, but why?","tavernjef","Mar 24, 2003"
2.41,-19.7,3.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Carbonation and body are average as is the drinkablility. There are much better beers out there though in this price range.","cretemixer","Feb 24, 2003"
2.46,-18,3,2,2.5,2,3,"Slightly cloudy light yellow in color with virtually no head to speak of. This is unexciting to drink. I taste just a faint honey and it's not natural. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery. This beer is refreshing though. It definitely would be a good tight budget summer session beer. But I'd rather cough up a couple more bucks for something better, like a weiss beer that tastes like a weiss beer.","AudioGilz","Feb 02, 2003"
3.17,5.7,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,"I am not a fan of Leinenkugel's. maybe it's the healthy Minnesota/Wisconsin rivalry. Poured straw yellow, with almost no head. Taste is very sweet. The honey is there, but also a faint fruitiness. Finishes sweet and syrupy. Overall, I had heard bad things about this beer. I did not hate it, in fact it was a nice change of pace. Wouldn't recommend it, but wouldn't turn down a bottle either.","Rifrafboy","Jan 03, 2003"
2.41,-19.7,3,2,2,2.5,3.5,"i'll continue the whipping of this beer............bright yellow color, thin head.  very muted aroma of honey and lemon.  tastes like nothing.  my taste buds are straining to pick up the wheat and honey characteristics..........oh well, it's pretty slammable which gets it a slightly higher drinkability score.  a good summer brew for the masses.   a bad anytime brew for the advocates.","budgood1","Nov 09, 2002"
2.63,-12.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"This brew lacks balance, honey and a sense of direction, which is not indicative of Leinenkugel.","BeerBob","Sep 01, 2002"
3.2,6.7,3,3,3,3,4,"Actually, this beer may have wheat and honey but their distinctive traits have been strategically removed during the brewing process, what is left is a gold beer with a light head, a mild unoffending taste and aroma with a hint of lemon and sweetness.  The beer goes down smooth without offending anyone.  I guess this is a "bier" meant to be drunk when the temperature hits 85 and your cooler is empty of everything else.","brakspear","Aug 07, 2002"
2.85,-5,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"This doesn't hold a candle to Leine's Creamy Dark. Passable wheat beer but there just isn't much under the hood. Faint honey aroma. Straw colored with thin head. Very light flavor with little character.","Dogbrick","Aug 01, 2002"
2.4,-20,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,3,"Surprisingly clear darker yellow color.  Head is sparse after 20 seconds.  A little estery aroma.  Certainly not an overbearing sense of honey (like a Michelob Honey Lager), but then there's not an overbearing sense of any flavor.  Vague maple sweetness, a little hazelnut in the aftertaste but little to no spice or any other Wheat characters.  This beer is pretty dang bad -- like many "Leinies" products, the flavors just aren't there.","ADR","Jul 03, 2002"
2.18,-27.3,3,2.5,2,2,2,"In some odd way...this beer reminds me of Corey Feldman.  I am just not sure why this was/is popular around here.","cokes","Jun 10, 2002"
2.88,-4,3,2.5,3,3,3,"This is a pretty popular beer up around these parts.  Big full head.  Light malt and lager  type aroma.  Clear and yellow-gold.  Can't taste honey or wheat in the flavor.  Really doesn't taste much different than a typical American lager, maybe even light beer.  Occassionally get a hint of wheat, but not much beyond that. Some bitterness to the finish. Medium fullness and carbonation.  Largely a summer thirst quencher.  I'm sure this brewery can make a better beer than this.","garymuchow","Jun 02, 2002"
2.6,-13.3,2,2,3,3,2.5,"Leinie Honey: this is arguably a Weiss beer, but it neither looks nor tastes like one.  It has a sweet aroma, and a nice light taste that you can drink all day.  But it is clear, and is nothing like any Weiss I’ve ever had, seen, or heard of.  Try Sammy’s new Weiss if you want to get close to the style.","jackndan","May 29, 2002"
2.93,-2.3,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Not a bad beer if you want to wash down food or you want to quench your thirst. Not much there in the way of flavor or complexity.","EagleTalon","May 13, 2002"
3.35,11.7,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The flag-ship of their line I believe. At least it's the one everybody in MN goes for first. A good summer ale, sweet, nice light smell. A bit thicker than you'd expect, which is good. Goes well with large grinder sandwiches.","packetknife","Apr 28, 2002"
