Sweet/tangy wheat dominates with enough bubblegum and banana to keep me thinking. As it warms, light, flowery spice and citrus emerge. God I love a good wheat beer. The only negative for was that the carbonation level seemed a bit low. Ramp it up and I would buy this by the case.","DIM","Sep 29, 2014"

3.74,-1.8,,,,,,"Poured  from a 16 oz. can into an Euler stange. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to patchy foam and thin ring around the glass, no lacing. Aroma is sweet wheat, a hint of citrus and an unexpected hint of caramel. Flavor is wheat, light biscuit malt with hints of caramel and toast, light lemon, interesting. Light to medium bodied with peppry carbonation. An interesting take on a weizen. My glass had a faint haze, but certainly not as cloudy as a hefeweizen, don't remember if this is typical of this filtered variety. Although all the weizen characteristic flavors are here, they seem to be melded with a biscuity malt, which is not something I've noticed in a weizen before. This kinda reminded me of a kolsch, albeit a mildely weaty and citrus one. Not quite to style, but I really liked the flavor here, the wheat/malt base is pleasant and more substantial than I expected. Nicely done. I would gladly get this again for a hot summer day.","LiquidAmber","Beers"
