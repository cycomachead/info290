3.49,14.1,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"this is a style that mandates robust carbonation, and this one never gets there, but aside from that obvious mouthfeel dilemma, the beer is pretty nice. clean filtered here type, white wheat malt and a fruity yeast combine for a simple clean and refreshingly quaffable brew. certainly not at the level of some of the best german and austrian examples of the style, but for a small american outfit, its delightful. crispy finish, just a hit of banana and dryness to it, but i could drink ten of these in an afternoon if they were cold. the problem is, it doesnt warm up well, dropping what little carbonation it has, and getting heavy. nothing earth shattering here, but a good local craft brew worth drinking on your next trip to billings. works well as a summer session brew.","StonedTrippin","Jul 31, 2013"

3.2,4.6,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Although Grizzly Wulff Wheat lacks the appearance and aroma of a well crafted beer, it is one of the most thirst quenching beers I have had in a long time. Almost has a lemon soda quality to it that would make it perfect for those lazy, long summer days up around Yellowstone. Too bad it's retired now, or it would make the perfect summer golf, fishing, etc beer up in Montana.","Bockrules","Oct 05, 2007"
2.59,-15.4,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This is an interesting and very off the wall beer. I appreciate it, but I am not enamored by it. Overall this is a strange lemony beer that is reminiscent of a bad stand in elementary school. This is too tart, too sour, and too puckering.","timmlimestone","Jul 29, 2007"
2.23,-27.1,2.5,2,2,3,2.5,"Drinkability: Skip it.","ChainGangGuy","Jul 11, 2007"
3.08,0.7,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"The taste is a bitter-ish one with notes of wheat, barley, and other grains, as well as a bit of sweet caramel after the carbonation subsides. Nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel is smooth and unoffensive, with and uber-light body and a decent finish. This is not a great beer by any stretch of the word, but it is easy to drink and refreshing in the heat of the summer.","wagenvolks","Mar 16, 2007"
3.35,9.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Again I like the label art from this brewery with it's flyfishing theme and the name of the beer which was mentioned in another review.","wcudwight","May 06, 2006"
2.32,-24.2,2.5,3,2,2.5,2,"Grizzly Wulff Wheat is named after the Grizzly Wulff Dry Fly (depicted on the label), which was invented by a man named Lee Wulff. Unfortunately, that's the most exciting thing about the beer. It isn't much of an 'Austrian Kristall Weizen'. Hell, it isn't even much of an American pale wheat. I sure hope the rest of Yellowstone Valley Brewing Company's lineup is more accomplished, because I'm not about to bite on this one again.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 06, 2006"
3.39,10.8,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"D: I think what throws people with this beer is the appearance to it, looks like a miller lite. Maybe I'm a little partial cause this brewery is my regular hangout but, I do enjoy the smell and taste of this beer. Probably my least favorite beer from this brewery, but not a bad beer in my opinion.","loren01","Aug 09, 2005"
2.8,-8.5,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Fore is light and crisp with carbonation. Malty and even slightly bready. Extremely low intensity bannana notes, but overall not a whole lot of flavor which makes the beer quite unmemorable.","Jredner","Jul 02, 2005"
2.25,-26.5,2,2,2,3.5,2.5,"Bottle obtained from a local liquor store and consumed a couple evenings later in August 2005. Pours a two finger white tan head over a cloudy peach yellow/orange liquid (the yeast were dumped into the glass). Smells pine-sol citrusy hops with some apricot and caramel. Tastes potently green apple sour with pineapple, citrus, pine, and a spicy zing. The sour has a perfumy candle character about it. Can't tell if there is any hop bitter or clove because the sour is so potent. Wet sweet with a tart finish. Moderate acrid carbonation forms tiny stingers on my tongue, but the head is completely gone. By appearance, this could be a flat two-day old beer.","mentor","Nov 14, 2004"
3.5,14.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability- Quenched my thirst at the time. I would agree with the American wheat or even the Krisal, but not a true hefe. Worth a try though.","GClarkage","Oct 10, 2004"
3.15,2.9,3,3,3,3.5,3.5," This brew has the faint aroma of Yellowstones other light brews .","beerceller99","Sep 01, 2003"
3.25,6.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Brought back from yellowstone. I will keep this short because there is not a lot to say about this one. This is nothing more than a nice, micro wheat. The taste is a little sharp and tangy, but it is still enjoyable. I like my wheats a little crisper than this one gave out. There was a nice amount of light carbonation off the bottom of the glass. The taste of lemon grass is very evident. Decent beer, but boring when you have a fridge full of other choices.","ALESwhatCURESya","Mar 18, 2003"
2.13,-30.4,3,2.5,2,1.5,2,"Upon my initial sip, the beer felt like it foamed up in my mouth, like how warm soda does. Excessively carbonated, almost bringing tears to your eyes. A very tingly mouthfeel, with a sourness overriding a mild soft wheat maltiness. A dryish finish, without much to the flavor, besides a lemon juice citric acidity. Not very good, and the oxodization doesn't help.","UnionMade","Jan 31, 2003"
3.32,8.5,3,3.5,3,3,4,"This beer pours a hazy golden yellow color with a small white head and a thin mouthfeel. The nose was a sort of "wheaty"(go figure-I've got to work on my descriptors) malt. It tasted of non-descript malt and an even milder unassertive hoppiness. This is a mild non-confrontational easy swilling wheat with little character. I think it might make a decent session beer and you might be able to use is as a transitional beer for the macroswillers.","fattyre","Aug 26, 2002"

4.3,40.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This filtered wheat ale pours a clear golden color with a quickly dissipating head.  The aroma is one of a wheat ale coupled with a hard apple cider.  The light sweet flavor also has a cidery quality to it and a mild yeast presence which makes for quite a refreshing beer.  The finish is light and clean.  Quite enjoyable.","beernut7","0"
3.85,25.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Much to my liking when my mail order beer came on this hot, humid southern day it was a wheat which I especially enjoy on days like this.  After getting it cold and pouring it it had a nice golden color and a nice even head, even though I prefer my wheats unfiltered, it had a good appearance.  The aroma wasn't strong but had a refreshing scent to it. Had a good mothfeel to it and went down way to smooth.  I was kicking myself for not chilling more than one, I recommend this beer its a keeper.....CHEERS","tigerpaws","0"
