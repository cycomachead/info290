3.69,1.1,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall, a very good beer but a bit harsher and less refined than the 2014 version. Still, very tasty!","SD-Alefan","Aug 04, 2014"
3.85,5.5,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall: Beer #1 in the Schell Weizen mixer. The 1984 is pretty tasty but not as intensely flavorful as the 2014 weiss. Could be because of the filtering/style. Touches the usual hefe bases but not as strong. Interesting to try.","Mdog","Aug 01, 2014"
1.98,-45.8,3.5,1.75,2,2,1.75,"Poured this into a August Schell hex-base weisse glass. Clear, golden color, with a huge white head that filled the top of the glass, appropriately. Aroma of banana and clove, yucky wheat malts. In the taste, rotten banana, white bread, bubblegum, clovy spice. Just off-putting overall...I didn't care for it. Medium body, mouthfeel was slick and grainy. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I've definitely had better than this.","Rifugium","Jul 31, 2014"

3.52,-3.6,4,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Overall: Not nearly as flavorful as Schell's modern version. I don't know how much is due to recipe changes vs. simply not filtering the beer any longer. I am happy to have tried this for historical reasons, but otherwise not worth having again.","bsp77","0"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"O-note to self. Drink this one close to 30F. Still flavorful with a better mouthfeel. Like this beer but prefer today's version. Still fun to go back in time when the only beer I was drinking was the warm backwash in dad's returnable stash of Hamms-this is pretty good too.","deebo","Jul 05, 2014"
