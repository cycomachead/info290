4.18,15.2,3.5,4.25,4.25,3.5,4.5,"Overall, this is one of the best Kristals I've ever had--it certainly has more weizen character than the German varieties we get, which seem to be aimed at blandness. This has real yeast character. I hope this becomes a standard item, since because of my gout, I've had to cut back on bottle-conditioned, unfiltered beers. And there are almost no good filtered German-style weizens out there.","allengarvin","Jun 28, 2014"

4.15,14.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Another really enjoyable and subtle hit from Franconia. It is great to have another brewery that creates well made and fresh German styles in the heart of Texas. Well done, and will know doubt be underrated here.","champ103","Jul 04, 2010"
3.62,-0.3,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"a terrible looking beer that cleans up... come out a bit orange and nearly clear with a head of about a half of finger. not think bubbles. nice and hoppy quality and grit wheat malt. not as crisp as same as it seems to have an american hop malt quality. still something good but not as lean as i would like to see it. i would say more so an american crystal wheat with come wheat quality but not light in body. still happy to say something like this coming out of here though. thanks guys keep them coming.","rtepiak","Beers"
3.68,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a clear golden yellow with a white head. The aroma is grain with some citrus and floral hops. The flavor is floral hops with some wheat, biscuit malt and lemons. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","0"
