St. Bernardus Tripel is one of the best examples of its style that I have yet tried, and a much more robust, satisfying brew than their Watou Tripel (also included in this sampler). It's a pleasure to drink, and I'm saddened by the fact that I probably won't be able to procure any more without engaging in a road trip or border crossing. Positively outstanding, and quite possibly my favourite St. Bernardus beer of all.","thehyperduck","Jan 14, 2015"

4.42,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, best before 11/21/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, peach, pineapple, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, honey, candi sugar, bread, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, peach, pineapple, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, peach, pineapple, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible tripel style! All around amazing complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering.","superspak","Nov 22, 2014"

4.5,5.9,,,,,,"The same thing applies to the taste, floral, grassy notes define the first impression. The processed hops aren't particularly bitter, but they do confirm the spices of the brew outstandingly well, adding a lot more character to the beer, than the usual Tripel would allow. Spiciness has a semi-dry note to it, while peppers, cinnamon, ripe banana, pear and apple, as well as burned caramel shine through. Includes also an earthy, herbal coordinate, close to a Saison, which gets detectable during the slightly bitter finish, accompanied by soft, slightly slick yeast.","aleigator","Nov 16, 2014"

Head white, fairly quick dispersal. Taste was, for me, true-to-form tripel with citrus-spice up front and yeasty in finish with very mild aclohol. Mouthfeel was pretty full-bodied with a more aggressive carbonation than it looked like it would give. Citrus lingers on tongue for awhile. Keeper, will buy more.","MisterGone","Jul 27, 2014"

3.77,-11.3,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,"Poured a bottle obtained from a St. Bernardus mixed pack (I wish more Belgian breweries did this) into a goblet. A live pour, although dropping the bottle on the floor first probably didn't help matters, with a ton of white froth that settled out to a more reasonable level. The beer itself presents as a cloudy honey yellow, with an aroma of shortbread, medicinal honey, apples, pears, woody/spicy Belgian yeast a plenty. The taste was more assertive than the smell, with an unusual and interesting butterscotch chip backbone, vanilla brownie, some grape-like lager character, tobacco, candied citrus rind, rosewater, a sweetish nuttiness, and sour green fruit all revealing themselves in a bit of a hodgepodge. Resembles its stablemate Watou Tripel in being on the sweet side for the style, although this one does have more heft in terms of both aromatic alcohol presence and a richer malt character. A touch thicker than other tripels and less fizzy as well. Nevertheless finishes on the dry side despite the initial sweetness, producing a tannic puckering effect on the mouth and thrusting some woody and gooseberry-like hops out there near the end. I like to compare my tasting notes to those of Micheal Jackson whenever possible, both as a reality check and a form of hero worship. In Great Beers of Belgium, he's got this one down as "vanilla, cookies, and sesame seeds, with a tangerine-like finish". I guess I did alright.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 19, 2014"

Smells like a triple should with nothing in particular standing out: yeast esters/tropical fruit and perfectly balanced hops and malt. Tastes like banana kiwi, citrus, slightly more bitter than sweet (which is good!), slightly spicy. It's soft and fuzzy, like a delicious pillow in your mouth (which is also a good thing!). Better than some trapist triples. Overall, a fantastic beverage from a fantastic brewery.","Eisen","Dec 23, 2013"

Brilliant gold colored body with a cloud-like pillow for a head. Bottle was aged for a year, and there was still plenty of carbonation. Smell was yeasty and musty, but in a good way. Taste was crisp for the style, and not as sweet as other tripels I have tried. Mouthfeel goes along with this; very crisp and dry. The abv was well hidden.

Compared to the Westmalle, the smell is much more yeast and banana-forward and a bit sweeter, where the Westmalle has a little more going on. Flavor is typical tripel flavors, but is a much easier drink than the Westmalle, it's not nearly as earthy, bitter or boozy and stays nice, light and fruity. Mouthfeel is interestingly creamy and really nice. Overall, this is a great, perfectly-balanced, refreshing tripel. There isn't as much depth in flavor as the Westmalle, but I find it to be a more enjoyable drinking experience.","starrdogg","Jan 26, 2013"

Overall I was very pleased with this as it develops increasing in temperature the spice character and hops seem to emerge with a a very flavorful quality and well rounded taste in general with strength matching the feel.

4.47,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: This is an incredible example of a triple, the champagne style scent, flavour and mouthfeel is outstanding. Easy to drink and never reveals the 8% ABV.

4.12,-3.1,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"-Overall 4.0: This was a very intriguing triple. I enjoyed this beer at approximately 50 degrees fahrenheit which brought out many, many flavors that I was not expecting. Actually, as the beer warmed up, tastes that I initially perceived as adjuncts (particularly in the finish) changed and became more obviously simply a lighter malt sweetness. You may want to try this if you have the chance to taste this very good triple.","BeerDocT","Dec 26, 2012"

4.97,16.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I must come clean up front, I love St Bernardus beers, and shockingly this beer out of the bottle is darn near as good as draft in Bruge. I purchased a 4 pack at Total Wine (glad to see they are beginning to carry good variety of bottled 4 packs of Belgians) and this Tripel is excellent. The pour is delightful, not overly carbonated, really an almost perfect head. The golden haze is classic for a really good tripel. The initial taste is neither sweet nor too dry, just right, without the lemony aftertaste of most Belgian blondes which have their own category. The smell is as good as it gets for tripels, great balance, hint of banana/caramel, but really a clean and fine flavorful beer and the moderate alcohol makes this Tripel worth a try. I plan to enjoy this particular brew many times in the future, especially now that I don't have to buy the 22 oz expensive model every time. I am occasionally torn about the overall price of Belgian beer and I will be glad when our stateside brewers catch up, which they will. Unfortunately we are a bit short on monks supplying out of the back monastery entrance, but our micros more than hold their own. The St Bernardus range of beers is wonderfully thought out and each has a reason, taste and character for it's existence. So I am happy to include this with their Abt 12/8/6 and Wit.","JimTeal","Nov 13, 2012"

The smell is of apples, banana, and citrus. The alcohol is hidden in the aroma. The aroma is mostly sweet and I do detect bready malt. The flavors are very well balanced. The taste follows the nose, with bready malt, banana, apples, and citrus. The beer is sweet, but not too sweet. There's a mild spiciness in the background. The alcohol isn't detectable at all in the taste. The mouthfeel is medium with plentiful carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent, well-balanced tripel.","acevenom","Jun 28, 2012"

Pouring this beer into a glass creates a huge head, if you are not careful the head will fill the glass in an instant and it will not settle for a long while. The head really is the outstanding feature of this Triple. The body has a peachy color to it, and is translucent with visible sediment floating about. The aroma is there, with hints of champagne and apricots. I was hoping for more of the Belgian yeast and bready aromas to come through, but they were not to be had. OK, on to the flavors. The St. Bernardus Triple stays light on the tongue, with subtle fruit flavors and an undercurrent of, well, beer taste. Hmmm. I guess that is good that a beer tastes like beer, but the fun of Belgian style ales is that they are distinctively so unlike “beer”. Do not get me wrong, this was a wonderful Triple, but I was hoping for a religious experience, and it did not materialize.","iSip","Feb 14, 2012"

3,-29.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Not even going to fully review this beer. It was such a huge disappointment. From a reputable dealer so I know nothing was wrong with it either. It is way too carbonated and fizzy, so plain tasting, and I dare say it tasted like a slightly better Budweiser. Nothing about this beer tasted good or of anything interesting. Now, it's not disgusting or horrible, but it was borderline bad. I'm giving it a 3 because I don't want to rip such an apparent "legend" but it was worse than that.

The aroma smelled of orange and apricots. Very nice. Medium in body, this Tripel was very smooth, highest marks for mouthfeel. A base of toasted malt, strong citrus flavor...lemon and orange, hints of ripe apricots and then moves to a sweet caramel almost candy sugar flavor.

The first smell is heavy apple cider after a little warming it reminds me of canned fruit cocktail. Taste is very fruity. Pineapple, citrus, apple and a few others I can't define.

4.12,-3.1,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Overall: An interesting take on the tripel syle and typically great beer from St. Bernardus. It's not quite my favorite selection of this style, but displays itself as a well balanced, flavorful, and ultimately refreshing beer. Due to it's excessive sweetness, it's not something I'd buy that often. Still, for the low price of 2 euros here in France, it's definitely a bargain unlike anything else. Recommended a try for sure.","magictacosinus","Sep 16, 2011"
4.09,-3.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Medium bodied with excessive carbonation, this beer is a little too drinkable considering its 8% ABV. The body is just right to allow the flavors to operate at full capacity while not being too thick. The carbonation is extremely fizzy at first but does not seem to imprede on the flavors.

Aromas of pale fruity esters (pear, apricot, cherry, banana), yeast, soft flowers, lemon sweetness, and spicy orange rind. The flavor is packed full of spiced fruity esters blanketing a mellow pale maltiness and peppery phenols. Soft, yet full-flavored and very well rounded. Somewhat doughy yeast, citrus rind dryness, apple, and honey. Smooth and creamy...well-carbonated with the slightest burn in the back of the throat. Excellent tripel, as one would expect...","wedge","Jun 25, 2011"

It has a lot of yeast and citrus to it and is mildly sweet. It has a lot of flavor for a tripel and the alcohol is very well hidden.

A tall retentive head, about 1/2 the height of the liquid persists for a couple of minutes before fading. Mild aromas of clear candies, with hints of spice and perhaps some very subtle fruits come off the pour. Similar to the aroma, the taste is creamy, full of the clear candy with hints of spice and fruit--very mild throughout. Not much complexity, which is to be expected for the style; however, compared to the St. Bernardus siblings, I find myself left wanting more. Moderately full in the mouth and smooth through the swallow and finish, leaving a slightly sweet aftertaste. It remains true to the Tripel, but lacks some character, best to stick with the Abt 12 and Prior 8 IMO.","xodin","Feb 25, 2011"

3.64,-14.4,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle, BB date reads 09-25-2012, into tulip. Clear, effervescent golden body is overlain by airy white head that doesn't last and completely dissipates. I'd expect the head to be firmer and creating more lace as subsides. Aroma exhibits light, somewhat bready, toasty malt character with a nice interplay of fruity esters, phenols, sweetness and alcohol. The significant fruity esters are represented by orange, pineapple, mango and peach, followed by moderate spicy and clove-like phenols, evident candy sugar sweetness and restrained soft spicy alcohol. As far as the aroma section is considered, the balance between esters and phenols is leaned towards the former while in the flavor dept the later prevail. Soft malty body embraces dominant peppery phenols and spicy alcohol flavor, subdued citrusy esters of orange, and moderately high bitterness that seems to result especially from the yeast-derived phenols as well as from hoppy bitterness. The relatively high bitterness combines with moderate carbonation to lend a dry finish with spicy aftertaste. The body is medium-light and somewhat creamy from the slightly warming alcohol.","crnipeter","Feb 13, 2011"

The first thing I noticed in the smell was a sour note. There was also some orange peel, but the sour note didn't match this. Some spice and caramel sweetness as well. After further sniffing the off-putting sour faded and the caramel came on more prominently. Pretty sweet initially. Then a fruity note comes through...this part is very good. Orange stands out and banana and bubblegum are pretty faint. The carbonation is a bit biting, but it matched the taste quite nicely. It also seemed to aid in the peppery finish. Alcohol was hardly noticeable. Pretty tasty brew.","alkemy","Nov 20, 2010"

4.13,-2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"11.2 oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Best before end 08 02 13 indicated on the back label. Pours a burnished, golden-orange with a creamy/frothy 2.75 inch head. Clarity is semi-hazy, with tiny bubbles effervescing in solution from the stem to cap. Head exhibits excellent retention, eventually settling into a 3/4 inch cap that is refreshed with a swirl. Delicate strands of lacing are exposed and adhere to the side of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals light citrus fruit (perhaps some apricot), cloves, a spicy/peppery quality and a suggestion of candi sugar and honey. Taste follows nose - a little grassy and the herbal quality is less spicy than suggested by the nose. There's also a slightly stale yeast flavor that comes out towards the back and somewhat quashes the sweetness that presents in the middle. Light fruit is more rounded and less citrus-centric. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a slightly scaly carbonation and a finish that falls a little short of semi-dry. A very nice and well-balanced tripel. This tends to be a hit or miss style for me, but this is definitely a hit in my opinion.","Jwale73","Aug 30, 2010"

Based on appearance alone this brew would receive a standing ovation from me. The smell disappoints a little as it is almost completely ether with only little hidden fruit/citrus. It tastes wonderfully malty and crisp with a nice, dry finish I've come to associate with these incredible Abbey brews. Perfectly balanced mouthfeel, creamy and light at the same time.

4.76,12,5,4,5,5,5,"11.2 oz. slender Belgian bottle with 30/01/09 on the back label; sampled November '08. Pours a gorgeous bright honey color with lots and lots of carbonation, capped with a bone-white fine-bubbled head that deposits loads of lacing on the glass. That's an easy five for appearance. The aroma takes a while to open up, but when it does there's a good dollop of orange, yeast and perhaps a touch of honey. Simple, but delicious. Similar on the palate - a little floral, a little fruity, with orange, spicy yeast, perhaps some honey, sweet and nutty malts, a faint breath of alcohol and a touch of spicy, mildly bitter hops. All of this on top of a lively, full and creamy, yet smooth body that has a lightly chalky yeast dryness. This is an amazing beer. So flavorful, yet delicate; complex and layered, but somehow simple. It's on the low end of the ABV scale for a tripel, but I like it that way because it is so damn drinkable that one small bottle is nowhere near enough to slake my thirst for this brew.","mmmbeer","Nov 30, 2009"

A great orange/citric smell along with tartness and yeast and has hints of figs, berries and sweet malts. A medium-bodied beer that ranges from fluffy sweet and smooth to sharp and sour. Started crisp with a tart fruit taste, like sour orange, but passed smoothly and the sweet caramel malt picks it up and it goes down easy with a sweet backbite. Other flavors include berries and figs and hints of toffee. This is a great beer that I could have all day.","clayrock81","Nov 07, 2009"

There is a bit of an ABV presence in the mid section through to the finish. The beer warms nicely and additional floral flavors on the palate come out. This is one of those incredibly complex Belgian beers that provide something slightly different with each sip, and really whet the taste buds as it warms. There are some sourish notes towards the finish, maybe a little mustiness on top of the apricot and citrus. There is a bit of a throaty ABV burn in the finish so the booziness is not entirely hidden with this beer.

This beer has its share of delicate funky yeast. The flavor is a careful balance of bitterness and earthiness. There are some good sweet malt notes lurking in the background, and I wish that they were a touch stronger or richer or something, but I guess that's not the way of most Belgians.

Incredible lacing on the glass and crazy rockiness to the head as it lowers. The smell is typical of an awesome pale belgian. Hints of apples, apple cider/juice, belgians spices and pepperiness. The flavor is sweet, fruity and peppery.The light peppery hop flavor is no challenge to the malty sweetness. The warmer it gets the maltier it tastes.

Golden, chill-hazed, pineapple yellow. Maybe some light orange color in the middle. Boozy aroma, yeasty, citrus fruity, and slightly sweet. Flavor starts out sweet, hints of apricot and oranges, maybe some pineapple, fruity to say the least. A wheat twang and bready maltiness mix nicely. Middle becomes a little bitter, and then a powdery dry finish. Nice amount of carbonation on this one. Become creamier as it warms. Booze is well-hidden when cold, becomes much more apparent as it warms. A great Tripel, but probably not my favorite. It's definitely worth the money to pick up a single 750 rather than a 4-pack.

A thin film of foam that one expects from mass produced lagers. However, for such a small head, it leaves plenty of lacing. The first smell is that bready, yeast smell. Considering the amount of yeast decanted, it's no surprise. A bit of apricots and oranges, plenty of warming alcohol and a bit of pepper as well. Tastes almost as good as it smells. Lots of malts, bit of fruit, bit of pepper. All well balanced, with one flavour not overpowering the other. Very thick, creamy mouthfeel that coats and gives a pleasant numbness to the throat.

A very nice blend of citrus, spice, malt with a nice little alcohol presence in the flavor. A little tang and tart in the finish and aftertaste which is surely a sign of the alcohol content.

It has a dark heavy appearance in the glass with an initially foamy head. The scent is quite sweet, you can really capture the strong sugar presence. The taste is exquisite- beginning with a malty, yeasty fruit character and finishing with buttery toffee notes. Extremely complicated beer that makes you want to savor every single sip. Perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. As I've said with other St. Bernardus beers, the 8% ABV is well hidden under the delicious textures of the beer.

A bit too sweet for me, but still quite tasty. Mouthfeel is very smooth - nice and light with sufficient carbonation. This is a beer that is very easy to drink.

Another trademark of the monastery are the complex aroma's of there brews. This one has pine, lemon, chocolate, dough, apple, cinnamon, brown sugar, and banana. Very sweet smelling.

Wonderful intertwining smells of Belgian yeast, and candied sugar give way to faint alcohol tones (nowhere near what you'd expect out of a 8% beer). The taste mimicked the nose fairly well, in addition to the sweet malt backbone that trails off into a slightly tart fruity finish. The mouth feel was fairly substantial, and drinking more than a 750 at a time might be a stretch. This beer pairs great with Spanish Manchego, and Port-Salut cheese. As Garrett Oliver suggests, triples go very well with pesto dishes, and this one is no different. Enjoy.","Greenfloyd","Feb 02, 2008"

While it was dry enough, it lacked the pop that's particular to St. Bernardus' beers.

Tastes of oranges, subtle lemons and faint spice with some breadiness mixed in and a very slight bit of syrup left on the lips. Alcohol lurks in the background along with some esters. Both are almost unnoticeable. Is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. I am going out on a limb here and say it's refreshing, which is quite an accomplishment for a beer of this magnitude.

I think this is my ~800th time to drink this beer but first review. St Bernardus might be my favorite brewery, so pardon my homerism if I get carried away. Pours a cloudy yellow with some light orange/gold tints. A massive pure white beautiful head that has some serious retention. Smell is pears, yellow grapes, sugar, candy sugar, citrus. Taste is very smooth, sugar, very bready, biscuit, light citrus and fruit. Mouthfeel is thin, but perfect and creamy. I dont know how they subdue the intrusive phenols (contrary to something like Maredsous which is also a wonderful beer) so well and make such a clean high ABV beers and this is no exception. A masterfully crafted beer. I might not be typical but I can session these. This is one damn fine beer and perhaps the finest commercial example of the style. YUM!

Pours a light yellow-orange color, crystal clear, with two fingers of frothy white head on top. Leaves great lacing as it drains. Surprisingly clear, although the later pours were a little foggier. Nose is tons of spice, bread, cotton candy, light lemon as well. Mostly sweet, spicy malt. Great nose. Flavor is great as well, and improves drastically as the beer warms. Refreshing citrus. Not even a hint of alcohol. Tons of lemon, with some breadiness. Candy sweetness. Carbonation is good and bubbly, spicy and refreshing - it might actually hide a touch of the flavor, although it eases as it warms.

There is a craminess to it, some slightly carmelized malt that amps up the flavors. The belgian spiciness is subdued but definately thre. The finish is dry but doesnt leave a sour note as some do.

Musty honey sweetness, powdery chalk along with pronounced banana esters and lightly tart green apple acetaldehyde in aroma. Clean, nectar like sugar hits the palate at first, then widens into a bready, dough like mellow sweetness. Fruitiness is comprised of mild banana esters and tropical hints of jackfruit. Subdued notes of black pepper alcohol, clove phenol and bubblegum esters add underlying herbal spice. Moderate in body and quite dextrinous, with carbonation lower than the norm helping lend a smooth mouthfeel. Residual sweetness is left relatively unhindered by the paltry hop bitterness. Finishes expectedly sweet, but slightly minerally, with a hint of must as well. A delicious tripel, with overall balanced skewed towards sweetness.

Clean, grassy hops and funky sour yeast flavor through the finish, which, all things considered, is surprisingly dry. Pineapple juice/peach nectar burps.

4.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"I was surprised on pouring the beer by how tame (and disappointing at first) were both its initial aroma and head. The first estery/phenolic whiff of fruits and spices was plesant but subtle and short-lived. Rather than a thick rocky head, the beer produced large bubbles that supported only a thin layer. But its effervescence never died down, and that thin head proved to be long lasting and left behind a modest collection of Belgian lace. The first wave of flavor is likewise a bit underwhelming, if only because the tart (not astringent) tingling of carbonation dominates. But as the bubbles settle down in the mouth, they leave behind wave after wave of harmonious flavors--none of which are unfamiliar in a Belgian but nor does any single note dominate.","petemorris","Mar 19, 2006"

My only complaint is a lot of the complexity in the nose is not apparent in the flavor which comes across lighter than the rich smell. Mouthfeel is great, light to medium bodied.

Mild and balanced, the flavours meld together very well. Malty up front, with some caramel and toffee hiding behind the doughy bread character. Alcohol is mild and warming throughout. Faint spices come through, some nutmeg, along with a bit of vanilla. Truly exceptional. Creamy, milky texture coats the palate, but isn't overbearing.

Chalky yeast persists near the bottom of the glass as mild carbonation makes its way to the surface. The nose is slightly tropical and fruity but really quiet tame.

The first thing that jumped out to me about the bouquet of the beer was a faint hint of banana balanced with yeasts. The taste first revealed what I had already smelled, but then began to come alive as it warmed, giving hints of candy sugar, hops and more complex fruit flavors. There was just enough carbonation to balance the creamy taste and mouthfeel. I was extremely impressed with the complexity of taste and feel on the palate. Most certainly one of the best Tripels Ive had in recent memory.","sinistrsam","Oct 23, 2005"

Lots of bready malt in the nose, along with some spice, a touch of alcohol, and a hint of fruit. Taste begins very smooth and tame, but then bursts into complexity. Similar to the nose, dry yeasty malt dominates, but there is also a good dose of spiciness that excites the taste buds. Subdued tropical fruit (pineapple and something else) are present, as well as an herbal, earthy, very slightly citrous hops presence. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, only a slight warming feeling is noticed. All in all a good tripel, definitely a must try, but I wouldn't rank it #1 in the style.","BeerFink","May 01, 2005"

The caramel-like sweetness is backed up by some noticable hop flavors (straw/grass-like) and with a hint of the vanilla that was in the aroma. Just a bit of alcohol is noticable towards the end. Fades into a pleasant finish that is sweet and at the same time a little dry. Effervescent with a somewhat chewy body. This beer is one of the best balanced tripels I have had to date.

Nice aroma, sweetish and fruity with unripe mellon, breadfruit, citrus and yeast all chiming in. Mouthfeel is lively -- seeming in style. An interesting take on a Tripel, lots of complex sweet maltiness more common in other styles -- fruits and dark earthiness, but a decent hop balance. The spritzy cartbonation combines to make this one fairly unusual. Estery finish.

The smell was sour lemon and fruity which were primarily of apricots. The taste grows on you because it is light and fruity, again with the apricot hints, but it has a definite malt breadiness.

Bready, cookie dough-like, and even slightly toasted malt appears in the nose; accented by notes of yeast, vanilla, fruit (cherry, pineapple), flowers, and delicate spice. It's zesty on the tongue with a very fine-bubbled effervescent carbonation that warms to become somewhat creamy; although the medium-full body might have something to do with that as well! The flavor mirrors the aroma with the addition of some leafy hops and a stiff, balancing bitterness.

The beer almost seemed to fizz like a soda, regenerating the head. The smell is like a bouquet of flowers with some citrusy aromas. The taste is not quite as harsh as the quadrupel ABT12, and the mouthfeel revealed all kinds of complex fruity and floral flavors. The ABV is also quite lower thus allowing for a greater drinkability. On second thought, maybe I do like this better than the ABT12.

Total yeasty spicy bready smell. Very "Belgian". Sweet light malts. Taste is fabulous. Much as the smell suggests, which is good. Yeasty sweetened esters up front with a freshly baked bread follow up. I think the merry monk on the label and I would be great pals. Great floral grassy notes to this beer, although not particularly "hoppy" in the American sense. A totally different interpretation of hops and malt here. And a tiny tad of bitterness at the end. Just enough to get your attention. Subtle is the word. But not wussy. Definately not. Very abundant flavor. Complex. Extremely cake-like. Very smooth and very light floaty mouthfeel.

Poured a hazy orange with a nice fluffy 2 finger head into my gulden draak tulip. Aroma is pleasantly yeasty and spicy with orange-like notes providing highlights. First taste and I am positive that this is the best tripel that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. Slightly sweet taste contrasts well against a mild spicy background. Reminds me a little of a nice yellow cake mix with some earthy spice added. A hint of brown sugar is present in the finish which i found surprising. Excellent brew. St. Bernardus has yet to let me down.","soper2000","Dec 05, 2004"

After a few minutes, the head starts to look like a damn snocone. Beautiful appearance. Aroma hits home with some bready yeastiness, mint, candy, lemon pepper, must and earthy hops. On to the flavor, which can be summed up best as "subtlety to perfection." Cookie dough yeastiness, bready tones, mint leaves, soft candy tones, pepper, lemon, grass and yellow cakiness. This beer melts in the mouth like mother fucking cotton candy. Effin beautiful. And drinkable. Nothing alcoholic at all about this bitch. This one is a dandy. One of the best tripels I've had.

It was amazingly clear for a beer. Great candy aroma with just a hint of fruit (apples and pears I believe). Delicate sweet character; almost wine in nature. This beer reminded me more of a Riesling, not a tripel. Silky light mouth feel very drinkable. Tripels are not my favorite style. I think they tend to bee too sweet, but this beer defies the trend and delivers a very pleasant experience.","carln26","Nov 14, 2004"
4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Top of the cork cage reads "2008" but the rest of the writing has been rubbed away. A rich, mucilaginous head the color of whipped egg whites, half an inch deep, starts to evaporate the moment I stop pouring. Noooo! Come back! No use... dies to a spotty eighth of what it once was. Roaring, endless carbonation; hundreds of tiny bubbles tessellate at the surface of the liquid. The goblet in my hand glows schoolbus orange with cadmium yellow highlights. Aromas are uninhibitedly sweet, vaunting honey, angel food cake, white grape juice, and rosewater. Talcum-powder nosefeel just barely keeps the sweetness from careening over the edge, with a starchiness to pull it in the direction of lemon pudding and, deeper down, graham crackers. Occasional whiffs of alcohol float around. The taste is a delicious marbling of pale candied fruit: gala apples, white grapes, pineapple, green cherries. In the finish can be found duck sauce, hop cotton candy, and some form of incidental spice (cinnamon?). A welcome crabapple sourness emerges with warmth. Strongly carbonated mouthfeel fades to impossibly soft, albeit with a light residual sweetness. A small addition of yeast lends some body that may stand up to the sugar for the better. As it is I'm not blown away... it needs... something. Delicate bitterness or rough alcohol or... something to lend it a self-contained idiosyncracy. But it's good. Damn good.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Oct 31, 2004"

This is a very good beer that I would gladly drink again and again, but to be honest, there are a few other Tripels that I prefer (and I do prefer tripels!!!).","Dukeofearl","Oct 07, 2004"

Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed 2" of dense, creamy, slightly off-white head over the light golden-honey hued brew. Head shows great staying power, and lacing is amazingly hearty and plentiful. Aroma is a bit spicy, in that expected Belgian way, with yeasty, slightly malty undercurrents. Taste is upfront delicately fruity, following with hearty malt character, and only the slightest hint of the alcohol we know all tripels have. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are both excellent. A must find for the Belgian aficianados.","ppoitras","Sep 30, 2004"

Cappuchino-like frothy head and a few darker colored yeast and protein coagulation chunks left in suspension. Nose is mostly of sweeter, bready malts, yeast and a complex fruitiness ranging from apples to tropical fruits. Initially malty and doughy sweet on the palate with lively effervesence, then turning yeasty and fruity and finishing dry and estery. Warming alcohol effect on the esophagus and stomach. Pretty unique and unconventional style of a tripel even though this is a classic whose recipe has not been tampered with. So I take back "unconventional".","crookedhalo","Sep 07, 2004"

The lacing on the sides of the goblet is quite nice too. The aroma is flowery and tropical with saffron, banana, coconut, and mango on the nose. The Taste is quite sweet with the fruity flavors mentioned above and alcohol warmth that reminds me of a mixed drink made with some rum. The finish is pungent and dry with slightly puckering hop bitterness and a peppery spiciness. A very well done Tripel that is now easily acquired in Georgia. In my opinion, sets the bar for the style.","rajendra82","Jul 03, 2004"

Great fruits of dulled down orange and lemon with some pineapple and banana. Super fine creamyness and fullness. Mild as all hell yeast and spice just barely make an entrance peeking even more interest within the flavors. Maintains a strangely interesting finish of chocolate and caramel malty thickness which covers over the fruits later on, quite amazing! Far and away one of the best Triples I've enjoyed!

There is the definite barley malt and hops flavors. This one is a little hoppier than a lot of tripels, but there is an unusual undertone of spice that seems to be cardamom or something else exotic.

4.6,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours with a dense meringue like three inch head. A cloudy deep gold color. Lightly sweet but dry at the same time. A bit of orange crosses my tongue. Smells Belgian in its complexity (imagine that), a fruitiness and a mustiness is here in the nose. A sharpness in the taste is present from the carbonation (this beer is well carbonated). There is some spiciness in the nose too. Very well put together triple, there is a certain softness/ roundness from the malt that ties this beer together very well. Definite alcohol notes if you look for it, but definitely not in your face. Displays the classic Belgian lacing as you work your way through your glass. One of the best, if not the best, examples of the Tripel style of beer.","Gueuzedude","Oct 27, 2003"

The liquid is slightly hazy, deep orange/gold and is saturated with hyperactive carbonation. Hm. Nose is just a touch fishy. Lots of alcohol and Belgian spice. Just a little dust. Wow. Major butter in the spicy, tangy front. The malty, thick middle adds generous fruit to the butter. Finish is fresh, dry, with alcohol and apples. This is one fantastic, fruity, buttery beer. Wow.","kbub6f","Oct 10, 2003"
4,-5.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Corked 75cl bottle. The cork on this one as with the Abt12 bottle I had recently, shot out like a rocket after I removed the wire cage. I tried not to disturb the thick layer of sediment as I poured the first couple glasses. Fairly clear golden ale with an orange hue. Sizable white head settles down to a creamy layer of foam. Aroma is sweet and fruity and like most Tripels I've had. Flavor has a distinct citrus character, lemon and orange come to mind. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel that goes down real smooth. Alcohol is well hidden. The last glass I poured inevitably contained some yeast sediment. This glass was really cloudy and the overall flavor was less enjoyable. I'd recommend trying to leave the sediment in the bottle. This is a great Tripel that seems to be widely available.","BierReise","Sep 06, 2003"

A little sweeter than I expected or would have preferred, but it is what it is. All-in-all a very tasty tripel.","Admiraldinty","Aug 29, 2003"

The bouquet of yeast, spices, fruity esters, hops and must is most pleasing. The flavors are quite diverse, as well. Notes of yeast, sweet malt, mild citrus, spicy hops, minor alcohol and apricot are detected. This is a very tasty brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation. This beer possesses a great drinkability and is very well crafted. It's easy to see why the monk on the label is so jubilant --- this is a hedonistic brew!","Jon","Jul 13, 2003"
4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy orange beer poured with a huge, fluffy off white head. Head retention is amazing. Little trails of carbonation can be seen tracing up the sides of my goblet. The aroma is a powerful fruity mix of bananas and orange, with clove accents. Bready malt and yeast notes are also present along with some peppery hops. The taste is really nice as well, with complex malt and hop flavors intermingling, with dashes of alcohol and yeast. A decent citrus note steps in ocassionally. Very bitter finish that is also extremely dry. Not much sweetness at all in this one, actually. Dry up front and a dry finish. Maybe a slight fruity sweetness in the mid taste. I was expecting to savor this beer for a while, but it goes down very easily. Nice solid mouthfeel is a little spritzy from the very fine carbonation. The only thing holding back the drinkability is the ABV, as it is slightly noticeable on the palate. This is a very fine triple that I especially like because it leans toward the dry side and doesn't get too sweet. More like an Abbey IPA.","aaronh","Jul 11, 2003"

There is no lacing on this one. The smell is a sweet citrus aroma, lemon and orange. A little bit of spice to the smell also. The taste is very sweet with more fruit coming out, and a hint of cinnamon. A light touch of yeast and alcohol in there as well. The mouthfeel is very full and just dances all over the tongue. For 7.5%, this is one is very drinkable tripel as well.","SheepNutz","Jul 09, 2003"

Nose is sweet and ultra-fruity, of the tropical variety with some slight bubblegum/banana esters wafting around too. Taste is lightly spicy/peppery...and quite fruity, like fruit punch fruity!

Flavor is very gently spiced and very smoothly balanced. Bits of orange, maybe some banana in the finish. Well-carbonated with a light mouthfeel and a dry finish. Still, this beer seems a bit "heavy" to me. The mouthfeel is perhaps a bit too creamy, and this could stand to be balanced by some additional tartness, or some extra kick in the hop department. Decent, but I couldn't drink several of these in a row.","mzwolinski","Mar 04, 2003"

4.97,16.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"An golden/orange-yellow hued haze of a liquid with a very nice white head that stays quite well without any help. Amazing aroma! In-your-face sweet and spicy with a doughy yeast background. Banana esters, juicy strawberries, and am I crazy, or do I detect some mango in there as well? Slight spicy alcohol tones as well. Great complexity. And now into my mouth it goes... The first thought that hits me with this beer is the amazingly thick and chewy mouthfeel. Not many beers have this, and for me, it's a highly sought-after quality. Like the aroma, very sweet doughy flavor from the yeast and malt, like a mix between cookie and bread dough. This is perfect with the mouthfeel the way it is. Clove shows up in the spice department, a welcome addition to the other flavors. There is a bit of fruitiness, mostly banana, but it's much more subdued than in the nose. Hop bitterness plays a slight role, balancing everything out well. Alcohol warms all the way through. More targeted hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, a wonderful, wonderful beer. This one goes on the "must buy in massive quantities" list. My favorite tripel, even above Unibroue 10 and New Belgium's "Trippel".","hyuga","Jan 27, 2003"

4.35,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Turbid dark golden hue. Covered by a fluffy, dense and well retained porcelain white head. Musty honey sweetness, powdery chalk along with pronounced banana esters and lightly tart green apple acetaldehyde in aroma. Clean, nectar like sugar hits the palate at first, then widens into a bready, dough like mellow sweetness. Fruitiness is comprised of mild banana esters and tropical hints of jackfruit. Subdued notes of black pepper alcohol, clove phenol and bubblegum esters add underlying herbal spice. Moderate in body and quite dextrinous, with carbonation lower than the norm helping lend a smooth mouthfeel. Residual sweetness is left relatively unhindered by the paltry hop bitterness. Finishes expectedly sweet, but slightly minerally, with a hint of must as well. A delicious tripel, with overall balanced skewed towards sweetness. St. Bernardus is soft on the palate and quite a mellow example of the style.","marc77","Jan 01, 2003"

Nose is yeast laden, malt, hints of lemon peel, with and underlying sweetness. Front is ambrosial, the top middling in feel, the finish is devilishly carbonated, divinely hopped droughty long lasting aftertaste. This bottle borders on being 2 years old, the high ABV is quite evident in the Belly Warming, and the deep malt body adds much to this beer.
