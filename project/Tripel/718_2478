Aroma of bready malt, apple and pear juice, cloves. Flavor is light stone fruit and pear, semi-sweet bready, lightly caramel malt, clove and coriander; finishes with light spice bitterness. Medium bodied with a  nice mouth feel. A classically flavored Belgian tripel, perhaps a bit on the sweeter side, but not out of style. Nice fruit and spicing.

Pours very hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apple, pear, apricot, grape, honey, bread, herbal, floral, candi sugar, earthiness, and lightly spicy yeast esters; some slight cardboard but its not too noticeable. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/malty notes. Taste of apple, pear, apricot, honey, grape, bread, herbal, floral, candi sugar, earthiness, and lightly spicy yeast esters. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, honey, herbal, grass, candi sugar, earthiness, and light spicy yeast esters on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/malty notes; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

4.03,8.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"OK, I did not plan to review this rather odd Petrus offering, but the unusual reviews from others dragged me into the discussion. This is an extremely fine mediocre Belgian. True it is nothing special, but Total Wine offered a four pack special and the price justified giving Gulden Tripel a try, it is well worth the discounted price. I hesitate to judge a brew by the price, but I always fall back on Anchor Steam or Sierra Nevada for precisely that reason, fine beer and justified price. Now, as what to expect, nice clean taste and appearance, decent head with average carbonation. I detect a touch of citrus closing out a very acceptable alcohol level, no bitterness and about half way through the clean finish actually begins to please the tastebuds. I will not stock up cases for aging, but I will be more than happy to run out of Total Wine with another four pack.","JimTeal","Oct 22, 2012"

In spite of my gentle pour, I still got a finger of fizzy bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and both Midas and Croesus were licking their lips while Greg Koch again called me out as a "wussy". Just more for me, Greg! Nose had a duality of up-front malty sweetness underlain by a yeasty mustiness on the back side. The two melded nicely to produce a Juicyfruit-like sweetness with rich esters. Mouthfeel was medium and boy, was this sucker dry! Man, I felt like I had just sprinkled alum on my tongue. Shazam! Three beers later and I have finally hit upon a winner. Warming, I began to get hints of black pepper, probably from the yeast. The finish was literally breath-taking in its dryness. Much, much better than the previous two clinkers.

This is not a very complex or tasty Tripel (maybe because the yeast-explosion has clouded everything) overall, but somehow my taste-buds agree with the consistent, mildly spicy & bitter feature endowed by the omnipresent yeasts.

This is a beer that I'd drink again, although, I'm not sure how I'd compare it to other tripels I've drank, I mean this one is still up in the air for me...I think a horizontal is in order for this one. Not one that I'm necessarily drawn to drink again, but then again I'd like to do a horizontal with it with some of the better/best tripels I've drank thus far.

4.03,8.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Bavik produces a very basic, but clean and well-brewed tripel under the Petrus brand name. It pours a clear yellow-gold body beneath a creamy head of bright-white foam that seems to hold forever. The lacing is pretty incredible as well, with high walls of bubbly but solid froth. The nose is limited to some yeastiness with an edge of fruitiness over a lightly sweet and wheatish graininess. In the mouth it's medium-light bodied and gently effervescent with a somewhat elevated, natural carbonation. The flavor is as the aroma suggests without much more: yeast enters at the front, followed by some slightly tart but mild red fruit; and then some mildly sweet hay-like malt appears before it finishes with a flourish of yeasty acidity (with a spritz of lemon), a flick of flinty bitterness, and a smear of leafy and spicy hops that linger along with some mild alcohol.

I like what I see so far. Odor is very lambic like, with hints of peaches, sweet malt and some floral notes. Taste is nearly exactly the same as the smell. Flavors of sweet fruit, mild hops and malt, with a touch of sour-bitterness on the finish. Some weak pepper notes. Good mouthfeel was lighter than expected, but nonetheless nice. Higher level of drinkability, I would imagine new comers to the Tripel style would find this pleasing. I would drink this again, but i've got to say that if value was a category, this would get a 2.

The mouthfeel is thick and prickly. This is quite a dry interpretation of the style. It could be a little more complex.","CAMRAhardliner","Oct 12, 2004"
3.55,-4.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"A bit creamy, but little douginess and yeastiness for a triple. a prominent metallic wateriness that didn't prevent drinking but left an unsatisfying aftertaste.

3.97,7.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Petrus Triple is a fine beer and is a more than respectable version of the style. Since the bottom of this rather dainty 8.4 oz. bottle came too quickly, I'll have to find another or three.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 03, 2004"

Sweet spicy smells to it...not as much citrus as tart pears or apricots. Starts very tart and zesty like a pilsner but hen the nicely layered malt body is revealed to the tongue....finishes dry....very much like Duvel....is it a clone? No it has its own distinct taste.","pootz","May 21, 2004"
1.8,-51.4,2,2,2,2,1,"I would like to start by saying that I love tripel beers, and have been trying them at every opportunity. And I was really disappointed by this tripel. Poured a light yellow, pale and weak with chunks of white yeast floating around. Unlike any other tripel I have ever seen. Medium sized head dies off quickly to a thin covering. Aroma is very sour, I am unable to smell anything else. Flavor is off, earthy, yeasty, not good. I would think the bottle had turned if the color wasn't so strange as well. Makes me think that this beer is brewed on some other way than most tripels. I could not finish this beer.","Dukeofearl","Apr 26, 2004"

4.15,12.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"An interesting tripple. The bitterness is a touch more than I prefer, there is a rotten fruity character which I don't like in my triples, the mouthfeel is explosive, and the acidity is uncharacteristic for the style.

3.85,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4," Carbonation is strong, but not overpowering, just enough to give you a little bite. The flavor has a nice sweet character as well as a bit of tartness from citrus. There is a bit more bread and yeast flavor to balance. The body is medium, but it is on the heavier side. Alcohol is well hidden, but you will know of its presence at times. It is a pretty good drinker as well. This is a pretty good one. It is really nothing out of this world, but it is a quality brew.","ElGuapo","Oct 11, 2003"
3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,"Dusky pale golden hue. Steadfast, porcelain white head with soft peaks yields sparse, rounded lace. Notes of musty, raw honey and mild phenol upfront in aroma. Hints of a citric, lemon like acidity and peppery ethanol are secondary. White bread sweetness initially in flavor yields to a drying combination of hop bitterness somewhat above the norm and black licorice. Mellow, lemon drop like fruitiness persists. Lightly bodied overall, with a passably dextrinous, albeit slightly chalky mouthfeel. Gentle notes of clove surface late and couple with residual sugar to lend an herbaceous sweetness. Finishes a touch oxidized with hints of marzipan and paper, but otherwise lightly sweet and clean. A no frills tripel, with all the required elements, but no outstanding qualities. Harmless, soft on the palate and very drinkable. Enough with the 8 ounce bottles already.","marc77","Sep 26, 2003"

Tastes lightly sweet, with a slightly peachy flavor, followed by a cheesy after taste. Fairly light bodied, which is on style for a tripel. Some astringency that finishes the beer off. I am not sure that this was the freshest sample, but I sort of liked the cheddar notes that I found in this beer, it added a bit of character that I found lacking in some of their other brews.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

4.4,18.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Pours a hazy mid-amber/orange color. The thick, beautiful white head clings to the sides of the glass and shows excellent retention. The aroma is very malty, with subtle hints of yeast and coriander. Maybe a hint of orange peel in there as well. Wow, what a great aroma. The taste is defninitely a triple, with a good spiciness, alcohol and malt sweetness, and a smooth, slightly bitter finish. Lingering spice on the aftertaste is nice. But there's also a subtle and unusual citrus/sour component that really cuts the sweetness of this beer. The mouthfeel is very nice, with a very fine carbonation bouying the solid malt backbone on the tongue. The drinkability is very good, from the flavor to the finish, mouthfeel to ABV. Possibly one of the more drinkable triples I've had, as it isn't going to last much longer than the time it takes to write this review. I can see why the monk on the bottle is so happy. This is simply a terrific beer. I must make some space for this one on a regular basis.","aaronh","May 09, 2003"

Anyway this beer appears a vibrant glowing gold with an orange tint to it, along with a bright white foaming head. Aroma is huge malty sweetness with great carmel tones, and definite touch of alcohol in the aroma. The taste is full of ester fruit tones that are trademarks of Belgium tirppel ales, but this one is not overly sweet or to overempowering in any way a beautifully balanced beer. Nicely carbonated with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel what an extraordinary beer. Yes, it is way too drinkable I could chill with this beer anytime, awesome.","WVbeergeek","Jan 26, 2003"

It has a nice refreshing citrus smell with a hint of peach or apricot. The flavor is somewhat light for a tripel, but it's thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. In addition to a flavor a little on the light side for the style, the mouthfeel was just slightly on the thin side. However, it's a very drinkable tripel.

Unlike most triples, you can actually taste the dry, hay-like malt. Usually yeast byproduct flavors overwhelm the malt. The finish is dry and short.

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a super well-carbonated beer. Even poured slowly, you'll get a big, frothy white head. Color is medium-gold and only slightly hazy. Aroma is yeasty at first, but this soon gives was to a very tart, acidic, citrusy smell. A bit shocking at first -- not at all what I was expecting for the style -- but pleasant, and a nice contrast to the flavor of the beer, which is rather mellow in comparison. Citrusy notes are still there, but the taste is more sweet than tart. Hops are noticeable but there are a lot of spices trying to make themselves notice in this beer. Somehow, they all add up to a fairly pleasant, dry finish. Effervescent and light-feeling in the mouth, with a somewhat yeasty aftertaste. A good beer. Not what I expected from a triple, but a nice surprise.","mzwolinski","Jun 26, 2002"

Crisp, dry, and refreshing finisher. Great beer to have with lunch, I like to match it with an oven roasted turkey and cheese. One of my all-time favorite beers.
