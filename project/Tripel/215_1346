There is something in the flavor profile that throws me off, and may just be my own senses.  It is not bad, just not my favorite.  An excellent beer, just not quite right for my palate.","infinitebruner","Apr 01, 2015"

This bottle was aged at least 2 years and so perhaps it was not as fresh as it should be enjoyed, so my assessment is a slight disappointment as I recall this being better the last few times I drank it. Will try it again for sure with a newer bottle and give this classic it’s due which may drive up the overall score.","CHickman","Feb 18, 2015"

So after 1500 reviews it may be best to simply say that compared to other Tripels, this one is a bit muted, more subtle, more easy drinking. Each of the expected profiles that we see from the likes of Westmalle or St. Bernardus are indeed present, just in a less intense manner. Could be a nice "intro" Tripel.","MisterGone","Feb 02, 2015"

Smell: bready, grassy and spicy, muddled fruity sweetness...like a peach flavored juice blend that's really mostly grape and apple. Taste: wheat bread, dried apricot, quite grassy and herbal, booze and pepper in the finish. Hefty carbonation really cuts through and ends the sip too early. Definitely not one of my favorite interpretations of the style.","babaracas","Nov 19, 2014"

4.36,5.6,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 6/24/2012. Pours fairly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Large amount of earthy/peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly dry finish that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible tripel! All around outstanding complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 23, 2014"

Good aroma of hefeweissen-esque banana and lemon in the smoke upon opening, although aroma was somewhat weaker upon pouring.  Crude stab at mouthfeel - medium body?  Taste - initially dominated by boozy, peppery bitterness; upon acclimation picked up the aforementioned hefeweissen-esque banana notes as well as the soft sweetness of mango.  I liked this beer because it is elegant in its simplicity - like well-sourced meat or vegetables that let subtle natural tastes do the talking.","jjmclell","Jul 02, 2014"

Tasting it, I get more of that light honey sweetness, some earthy hops, black pepper, banana, and a slight hop bitterness on the end.

AROMA: brilliant banana and allspice; light citric scents of orange and coriander; tart and punchy--promising...PALATE: signature Chimay body--drinkable and quenching; 8% ABV never tasted so agreeable...TASTE: banana, spices--pepper?--with some citric kick--orange?--and pear/apple---a round, fulfilling taste... OVERALL: a joy to revisit an old venerated ale; this beer strikes the quintessential balance of finesse and strength, the holy aspect of brewing that blesses and breaks in equal sips...","dacrza1","Feb 21, 2014"

The dryness is maybe abit over the top and the taste on the mouth ends abruptly, I feel this is a two edged sword because while it retracts from the flavor, it makes you want to immediately take another swig to get the flavors again.","Manzier","Feb 18, 2014"

4.1,-0.7,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a Chimay goblet. Chimay's tripel is a golden sparkly amber color, just shy of light orange, with ample off-white head that retains its shape well (like its stablemates). Aroma quite sweet and spicy, pale malts that evoke shortbread or sweet dough, fruit notes like green apple and white grapes, citrus fruits, tobacco, yellow flowers, and spicy phenols. Palate is that of a classic tripel. Rather crisp and dry, and amazingly smooth with considerable carbonation that lifts the sweet and spicy flavors up without obscuring them. Would be among the most drinkable of Trappist ales were it not so hot and spicy! Ample clove and medicinal phenol character, hot aromatic alcohol, a fruity sourness like cranberry, a fruity sweetness like apricots (I get little dark fruit character and this makes it stand apart from its maltier cousins), vague hints of banana, and a residual candi sugar sweetness that you can detect in the finish amidst the potent spice and bittersweet floral notes (think marigold or dandelion) and dry walnut bitterness. This beer changes with age and I wonder if an older example would be less pungent, although according to Micheal Jackson (the beer critic) the clove flavors actually develop with age. Fantastically good beer that stands out in the smoothness department.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 24, 2013"

4.27,3.4,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Chimay's Tripel (aka "Cinq Cents") pours a russet sort of hue, which is just right for the style. A billowy, off-white head appears after a strong pour, and then recedes to about a quarter-inch or less. There is some carbonation visibly apparent. The aroma consists of bright fruits, caramel, walnut, and an earthy, or mossy type of scent. When evaluating the smell of the older bottle, (1998) the fruit esters seemed to make me imagine darker fruits, like figs and raisins, molasses instead of caramel, and Burgundy wine. The flavor of Chimay has that nice cranberry/dark fruit flavor with an woody/earthy facade. When fresh there's the tiniest hinto of hops in the taste. The finish lingers and there is a medium mouth feel. The alcohol is masked extremely well. Overall, as I previously stated, this is a must-have Tripel, especially if you or a friend are just getting into the style. If you age or have the chance to try an older bottle that was properly stored, you'll find that it mellows out into something much softer.","Neorebel","Oct 16, 2013"

It pours well, and smells great, but the aftertaste didn't really leave me excited for the next time I got the chance to have one. Very good, and I certainly would never turn one down, but I think I paid at least $11 for this one, and for that price, I want my socks knocked off. The bottle said to serve chilled, and I did, but I actually enjoyed this beer more as it warmed up a little.","GeorgeH","Sep 22, 2013"

You taste ZERO of the 8% ABV, which is a good and bad thing. Not one to knock back if you have to fly the helicopter home, but one to enjoy by the fire on a cold winter night...or in your shorts on a hot August night in Georgia, like I just did.

It pours a lightly-cloudy amber-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises bread, Belgian yeast, light clove, and a hint of orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with more clove and black pepper and a bit of banana peel for good measure. The breadiness is also toned down a bit here, helping the spices shine through. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a nice tripel, but not quite the paragon of the style I used to consider it being. The yeast comes across too bready and dominant to allow for much nuance to surface, but at least it's a tasty yeast effect...","TMoney2591","Apr 04, 2013"

The aroma emanates pears and apples, with very slight background tones of bread/caramel. The taste is powerful: the hops are very present in this full bodied, creamy, and well-carbonated beer. A slight acidity can be noticed in the background, superbly balance with the hop bitterness. The aftertaste is long and hoppy, and leaves a beautiful Belgian lace in your glass. This is a refreshing, and (as it should be) potent Tripel - but delicate at the same time. Go figure... This beer is excellent.","HabiMendes","Feb 19, 2013"

Appearance was a light orange, golden color with VERY slight (almost nonexistent) creamy head that was likely due more to the college pour from the bartender than the beer itself. Caught a surprising whiff of bananas, cloves, and dried fruit. Reminded me of a weird heffy, but in a good way. Taste was awesome... white grape fruitiness at first with a dry, peppery bite to it on the back end. I also tasted a bit of booziness that lingered well after sipping. Very carbonated, but it goes well with the style. Really enjoyed this beer, though it could be more nostalgia driving this review as Chimay was what got me into craft beer.","ClarkHimself","Nov 30, 2012"

Smells of pepper and light sweet sugar with hints of orange marmalade. Tons of yeast and fruity esters with little to no hop presence. The flavor is filled with sweet sugary maltiness with honey and light sugars being in the forefront. Sweet light fruit flavors of orange and tangerine with a light sweet cherry flavor. Lots of pepper and yeasty phenols round this out quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet prickly mouthfeel.

I had read the alcohol content on the label but WOW-was not expecting such a strong alcohol taste. I feel it is a shame, as the high alcohol detracts from the beer taste and aroma. Almost felt as if I were drinking whiskey. I know the beer snobs out there will poo-poo this but I drink beer for taste more than for alcohol.","gwalbroehl","Oct 06, 2012"

Mouthfeel was world class- very smooth and creamy. Full bodied, this Tripel had a foundation of malted grain, fruit melody of apple and pear, honey, yeasty and strong flavor of alcohol.

3.71,-10.2,4,3,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours like peach juice and piss or ice tea, a very dark brownish orange, but it has an almost ruby pink tinge to it with a nice creamy white head that dissipates at an average pace and leaves a thick sloppy lacing that forms mountain peaks and clouds on the sides of the glass... It smells banana-like with nice bready undertones from the yeast, and an almost lemon-like smell can be found there too. If you take a quick whiff you might also detect a slight trace of wet dog, which is not the most appealing thing to smell in a beer, but that is not overly present in the smell. The smell is actually quite weak for what I was hoping for, nothing is really prominent, but I suppose I’ll let it pass since this isn’t really a floral beer… It tastes like tart bananas. There’s also some nice slight spicing that gives it a little zest. There is almost a hops bitterness to the mouthfeel, though the beer is very crisp and thicker. It seems very cool and refreshing for a summer’s day, but sits a little heavy in the stomach (as most Belgians seem to for me…). In the second gulp I could almost swear I detected hints of peach in the flavor, but that may be because I said it looked like peach juice at the beginning of this review... The fruitiness of the beer is definitely present however, and leaves a nice sweet feeling on the sides of the tongue, with plenty of saliva frothing on the tongues top. Overall, this seems like a decent tripel, I haven’t really had enough beer in the style to pass actual judgment on it, but I found it palatable and tasty. I’m not a huge fan of the Belgians, but I would drink this again if I was offered it.","Maxwell","Jun 30, 2012"
3.75,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Golden pour, thin white head, fine lacing. Typical Trippel smell, though nothing too prominent. Taste is underwhelming compared to all I've heard about this being an excellent brew. Notes of banana, clove, wheat, and a touch of spice. Tastes like a slightly weaker and more bitter St. Bernardus Tripel. Head was not as creamy or large as St. bernardus either. I'm willing to give this the benefit of the doubt though and blame it on an old keg or dirty lines, but overall I was disappointed compared to all I've heard about this Trappist brew.","srv33","Jun 29, 2012"

There is some sweetness from the candied sugar and the fruity and yeast flavors really come thruogh and reflect the smells. There is some mild spiciness as well. It's very complex and flavorful. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is very lively. It's creamy and smooth. Overall, this is an excellent example of the tripel style. It's a quality beer and the general availability of Chimay beer makes this one easy to find. Anyone curious about this style cannot go wrong with this beer.","acevenom","Apr 28, 2012"

It was time for me to sample one of the standards, the Chimay. The Chimay has the appropriate copper color, which is pretty clear until the bottom of the bottle when the sediment gets stirred up. A good sized head forms on top, which I consider key for a tripel. The aroma is big on the wonderful Belgian yeast that makes this brew possible. Smooth throughout, the Chimay has good malt flavors accented with the aromatic yeast. Lots of yeasty and bready as it should be. No exotic flavors coming through. This is the working man’s tripel, if there is such a thing!","iSip","Apr 16, 2012"

4.21,1.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a somewhat cloudy orange amber with a thick white head, nice carbonation and lacing. Light fruit and Belgian yeast aroma. Creamy with light fruit, some lemon and banana components. Forwardly bitter, but the bitterness combines nicely with the other flavors. Bitter, yeasty and light fruit finish. This is the ale that helped me understand and won me over to tripels, a style I really like now. Complex enough to produce a nice sequence of flavors. Excellent.","LiquidAmber","Mar 29, 2012"

4.41,6.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, dark gold coloring with a foamy, dense, frothy white head of about a half an inch. Aromas are lightly toasted grains and biscuit, with a hint of banana and lemon zest and only a slight spicing. Flavors are crisp and clean, on a smooth body, with the clove and pepper spicing becoming more forward and strong to accent the palate. Bready and fruit highlighted backbone provide stabiltiy for the highlight characteristics, and the beer has an overall lightness to it. Great, solid lacing left along the glass. The aftertaste is a blend of the spicing and lemony sweetness, leading to a clean, slightly dry finish. This is a great beer!","GarthDanielson","Mar 27, 2012"

Overall a better beer than you'd find most other places, but it doesn't even hold an umbrella for the Chimay red, or other Trappist beers such as Rochefort 6, 10, Westmalle or st Bernardus.

There are so many complex flavors to this brew without being overly obvious. This is a beer that took me a while to decipher given its subtle characteristics and surreptitious craftsmanship. Lots going on here, but almost to the point where it becomes hard to pin-point. This is a good thing. And it seems every ingredient added deserves its place. Once again, I am left amazed by another astounding beer licensed under the 'Authentic Trappist Product' legacy. A true classic.","Agent1","Dec 11, 2011"

But after having quite a few great Belgians and trying some of the more creative American styles, this tripel just leaves a bit to be desired. The carbonation is a bit out of control, and the slight metallic flavor towards the end is a turn off as well. At this point there are a few readily available tripels I would rather have.","KickInTheChalice","Dec 10, 2011"

The Duvel tulip, in which it sits, handsomely showcases the beer. The aroma is an inviting mixture of hops and yeast. The fresh hops clear the passages and allow the imbiber a full experience. This tripel has a deceptively light body as it washes the mouth. Yeast and fruit on the palate give way to bitter, spicy hops. Raisins and apples mix wonderfully with the grains. Every sip reveals a slight different take on its complexity. Fruit, sweet malt, yeast, spice and bitterness are all in harmony. At the end the palate is left dry and bitter, but I for one, wouldn't have it any other way.","BeardedBoffin","Oct 29, 2011"

This beer is good, but there two other Chimays that ar better. The Grande Reserve is a world class beer, and the Dubbel is really excellent as well.

Very fruity nose, with apple, banana, peach, and raisin coming through and some caramel and brown sugar notes. Fruit hits the palate first too, with grape and apple skin, banana, and raisin. Vanilla, brown sugar, and caramel play a big role in the flavor too. Effervescent and light bodied, which combined with the pleasant flavor makes this one dangerously drinkable. Not at all what I expected. Excellent. Truly unique.","MrHurmateeowish","Jul 06, 2011"

About half way through you get a big bitter hop bite, it is earthy in tone. The bitterness carries you through the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated.

The lemon rind flavor hits first, immediately followed by hops that frame the fruity flavor and an overlying alcohol taste that binds it all together.

4.27,3.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Anyhow--huh, not really sure how to review this, now. It was very well brewed, at any rate, regardless of style. It started off with nodes of honey and caramel, which become spicier in the middle before finally getting washed away by a pleasantly aggressive Belgian yeast that was a combination of sour and spice nodes.","mynie","May 30, 2011"

Later after it warmed I could smell a hint of spice too but not the banana some have claimed but maybe that's just how my sample turned out. Taste has malt, and salt. There's a medium richness indicating a tripel but I've had richer. Finish is a moderate length. So all in all a good tripel from a world class place but not the king of tripels.","MoreThanWine","May 29, 2011"

No lacing. Aroma of malt and yeast dominate with floral and hoppy notes and very light hints of fruit. Malt flavor up front with a hints of baked bread in the middle. Finishes with a bit of bitter lemon zest. Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation up front. Dry finish. Fairly high drinkability for a beer with an ABV of 8%.

A bubbly white fluffy head a little more than a thumbnail resides but doesn't stick around for the party. Smells of floral alcohol and fruit. The taste is spicy, with a nice burst of white flesh fruit, and classic Belgian character. A hint of alcohol melds well with everything and brings out more apple as I delve further towards the bottom of the bottle. Very drinkable, the 8% is nearly invisible. The mouth feel is like having my tongue wrapped in billowing silk, think malls cabbage if you've ever had it, it has that soft characteristic to it. This is dangerous.

Fruit is up front followed by the yeast bringing on to a dry and refreshing finish of both. This one pulls no punches, it's a triple in every sense of the word. Body is bold and a big medium.

While it looked fantastic, with insane gripping lace, and had a traditional aroma, there was an inclusion of bitter citrus. This could have come in portion, from the hops, but it is different, and more bitterly fruity than hoppy. While many triples will have hints of orange or lemon, this brew took it to a whole new level, with an interesting bitterness that actually helped make the beer more drinkable, rather than what could have been overly sweet and bready.","TheBrewo","Dec 27, 2010"

Then the nose fades to a spicy clove finish. Taste is sweet and has a dominant clove spiciness. Again there is a yeasty bready character in the middle. It then goes into a clean hops finish. The mouthfeel on this beer is excellent. Well carbonated but very smooth and creamy. It sits very well on the palate. This is some good stuff right here. Very enjoyable.

Something to sip slowly after a turkey ruben, or anything else, for that matter, while waiting for the evening to cool off enough for a walk back to the hotel.

I deliberately saved the last bit and the yeast, swirled well and then poured it into the glass at the end for drinking. What I now have in the bottom of the glass is a very cloudy half inch of beer well permeated with yeast. Not surprisingly, this has changed the flavors in that much of the complexity is now hidden by the yeast.

I get some bayberry and oats, wheat germ and vague peach. More complex than I picked up with my nose and very nice overall.

This is a damn good tripel but not quite up there with the best of 'em, although the more I drink of it and the warmer it gets the more I like it.

Tons of fruity esters and powdery yeast come through followed by a nice dose of herbal, earthy hops and a healthy bitterness. The hop character is quick a bit stronger than I expected, but I really think it works well in the beer. The alcohol is fairly well hidden.

The nose had that beautiful Belgian yeastiness with banana, clover, citrus, coriander. The taste is everything the nose promises with a good carbonation balance, very crisp and light. The mouthfeel is outstanding. This beer is all about balance, not overly sweet or sour. On an unseasonably warm spring day, I could drink plenty of these. This was one of the first truly world class beers I ever had, well before my 21st birthday.

Head retention is decent, but not much lace to speak of, even in my spotlessly clean goblet. Aroma is spicy and tangy with plenty of character. Less clove than other triples, I get a lot of pepper and coriander off of this, and some fruity sourness as well. Flavor is wonderfully complex and well balanced. Plenty of coriander and white pepper with some grainy yet pleasant astringency. Also picking up some floral hops, a wonderful fruitiness and just a touch of alcoholic warmth. The warmer this get's, the more sweet and fruity it becomes with apple and pear notes. Yum. This beer is quite dry with a medium body. The carbonation is a bit spiky, but it works with the dryness to leave a wonderful, quenching finish behind after every tasty sip. I find this to be quite drinkable for a triple.

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Effervescent ,mostly clear honeyish golden-orange fluid topped with rich white head that retreats until a firm thick lacy coating is left. The scent is a composite of peppery phenolics, aromas of peach /apricot, refined sugar and quite evident spicy alcohol. Somewhat yeasty with peppery phenolics and flavors of peach /apricott incorporated into the malty body balanced by some hops and subdued spicy alcohol. High carbonation is leading into dry finish with prominent bitter aftertaste that seemingly lasts forever. Although the beer seems hoppier in character than most trappist ales, hoppiness is quite shy until the aftertaste phase when reveals itself as an everlasting bitterness. This beer is a shirk which escapes my attempts to evaluate it: aromas and flavors are somehow hard to take hold of. The apparent absence of citrusy esters so typical of a triple and the pronounced dryness remind me more of a golden strong ale than a triple. Sharp-edged,prickly on the palate and rather dry Chimay White is my least favorite of the three brothers.","crnipeter","Jan 04, 2010"

The taste was a tiny bit more subdued than the nose, with the fruit hitting hard first, then dissolving to yeast and herbs, and then finishing on a spicy/bitter note. Very good, but I've had some better tripels. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and moderately spritzy. It could've benefitted from more carbonation, but in retrospect I was surprised that the flavor wasn't more intense given the low level of carbonation.

4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a chalice, appears a golden-honey color, cloudy and turbid, with a huge off-white head having little retention. Aroma was huge. Yeast and bready malt were most apparent, then caramel malt and fruit notes including banana. Very sweet with a hint of alcohol. Each swirl of the glass provided another aromatic thrill. Very inviting. Taste was very sweet and bready up front and the sweetness lingered into the finish ultimately giving way to a hint of bitterness and noticeable warming. It was almost like drinking hawaiian bread. Mouthfeel was light, but smooth and became even smoother as it warmed. High carbonation tickles the tongue. Overall, a very tasty and warming triple. Would definitely have again, but not more than one at a time as this seems to pack more of a punch than even the 8% ABV would suggest.","slk22","Sep 11, 2009"

Balanced with a wonderful citrus nose with bready undertones and a bit of belgian funk makes for a truly unique and wonderful smell. Taste is balanced as well with more of the same but with a green apple almost celery/fennel undertone. Absolutely a wonderful mouthfeel perfectly carbonated hiding its abv very well.

Everyone should try it at least once, if only to get an idea what a solid tripel tastes like.

Nose is a mixture of spicy phenols, cloves, a bit peppery and some fruitiness. The taste is very similar to the nose but more potent and the alcohol is readily obvious in a solventy way. Decent flavor on the front end, but I've had much better disguised alcohol on the back end. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with a velvety, thick carbonation and dry finish.

Curacao orange in the nose with a complex spice aroma (juniper, coriander, ginger), minimal hop aromatic presence. Sweetish taste (not as sweet as Westmalle), but not so much candi sugar, more citrusy orange, lemony and esters, and one of the most complex spice flavor profiles I've ever encountered, with clove and coriander predominant. Very dry finish. Pretty drinkable for the ABV. Not an everyday beer, but certain one every BA should experience at least once.","jdense","Jul 11, 2009"

The aromas coming off of this beer are bready yeast, spice, floral hop and fruit. Initial taste is bready, malty, yeasty with some spice (coriander/cinnamon) and a sweet fruitiness. Then there is a bitterness that kicks in along with an earthy, floral hop flavor. The beer finishes rather dry with a warm alcohol and lingering bitterness from the hops and tingle from the carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy during and dry and tingly after. Lots going on, very nice. This is a great beer. I like the hop presence, but maybe not the elevated bitterness. For me the bitterness takes away some of the character introduced from the other flavors and overpowers them. Of course the bitterness does mask the high alcohol...All in all it is very delicious and well crafted.","Kromes","Jul 09, 2009"

The only other tripel I have to compare it to is la fin du monde which is more intense and overwhelming in flavor which makes it an epic brew but for some would be too much. This is more of a balanced grown up la fin du monde which makes it more of relaxed an subtle experience. I wouldn't say I prefer either over the other but they're slightly different. Chimay is more subtle and solid while la fin du monde is in your face. Chimay is more delicate. Back to drinkability though rather easy to drink for what it is, BMC, adjunct or american beer style lovers beware this beer has flavor and complexity.","MaxBrews","Jul 09, 2009"

I make out grapes, raisins, yeasts, malts, some hops, a bit of candy sweetness (laughy-taffy) and some biscuity goodness. Carbonation is active and big according to the style.

I figured I'd start of with the Triple, it being the lightest weighing in at 8% ABV. It poured into the goblet with a nice foamy head. The head disappeared quickly, leaving a line of bubbles along the inside rim of the glass. The scent was the scent was musky like a farm house ale but faint. Fortunately what it lacked in aroma it made up for in flavor. This is a bold triple, with a good bit of bitterness. It is a heavenly mix of both fruit and spice, with a smooth finish that doesn't vanish right away. It's funny though; a triple reminds me somewhat of a pinot grigio, not that I would ever admit to drinking one. It isn't a deep dark ale, but is complex and light on the palate all at the same time. There was a good bit of sediment in the bottle, which I made didn't end up going into the goblet. CHIMAY is an awesome Belgium beer, and I would recommend them to anyone.

Pours with a nice fizzy head, and with a sunset yellow color. Smells like a classic tripel, with notes of spice and hay on the nose. Tastewise, it's quite good, one of the classic examples of the style. The only thing that I think it needs is that added "oomph"' that some tripels hit you with on the palate. But I must admit, there are a lot more adventurous tripels out there when compared to Chimay White. Otherwise, this is a great choice now that you can find Chimay in more and more bars.

The head eventually dropped to 1/4 inch but never faded totally. The beer is a highly-carbonated bright amber orange, and it's quite attractive. (Food should please the eyes as well as the palate.) The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with a underlying sweet malt and hints of fruit. The aromas are precursors to the flavor palette. A complex blend of hoppy, fruity and yeasty. There are a range of spices lingering in there as well; pepper, cinnamon are noted. A faint candy sweetness waits in the background. The aftertaste has some drying bitterness with peachy fruitiness in the end. I found the alcohol to be very well-masked.","davidt","Feb 19, 2008"

Taste similar to nose with the addition of the faint presence of apples, (but much less pronounced) followed by a crisp, citrusy-tart finish. Tingly mouthfeel, not surprising given the abundant head.

4.27,3.4,4.5,5,4,4,4," Drinkability is partly there- at 8% it's not something that you'll die from splitting a six-pack from, but I'm not sure if this is something you would want to. It's a beer that once you start drinking (and really, if you're not reviewing a beer, who is going to take 2-3 minutes to analyze the aromas of the beer, giving it time to warm and release flavors) I can see it becoming a beer that you might actually become a little bored with, and at the same time, since it is such a subtle, one-dimension beer, a beer that you could really start to drink quickly as your consumption increases. Jesus I don't know. I feel like this beer misses somewhere, or maybe I missed somewhere. Maybe I just didn't feel it with this beer. Maybe I had a bad bottle. Maybe my palate was shot.

At $5.49 a bottle, definitely overpriced and Im certainly glad I only purchased one. My first and last Chimaygone. I am not going to slam this but this certainly ranks among the least favorite tripels Ive had. Too bad as I was expecting much more.

There are more flavors present, but these are the most pronounced. Medium and slightly harsh mouthfeel. Not as smooth as expected, but not terrible. Good flavor makes for a drinkable tripel, but the higher abv. keeps this from being a sessionable ale. Overall, not a bad tripel.

A bit boozy to the tongue, perhaps because the mild flavors can't quite cover up the alcohol. The slightly bitter dry finish is pulled off, but the whole thing feels off.

Before i drink it you can see the sediment start to settle on the bottom of the glass, but still tons of carbonation. tastes good, but not great, not 10 dollars a bottle good either, floral notes are in the beer, with a warm alcohol presence, unfortunately it tastes a bit more watery than it should. at 8% i could still down a few of these so the drinkability is high, even though its higher than average ABV. its a good beer, i heard GREAT things from it, if it were cheaper i'd probably be a bigger fan but 10 bucks for 25.4 onces is kinda high.

I believe I enjoyed the smell a little more than the taste it presented. The alchohol definitely makes itself known behind the increasing hops toward the end as it warms.

The aroma was a nice mix of spices, light fruit flavors and a peppery property; this is a nice aromatic brew. The taste is excellent with highlights similar to what was noticed in the nose along with a good amount of carbonation. As the brew warmed I noticed different properties of flavors as the alcohol come out more along with what I think is a more pronounced yeast like flavor, could be wrong on this taste though.

The taste was slightly sweet at first, with a good hop balance which was present more in the finish. I also picked up some clove/pepper towards the end. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a body that seemed lighter than the bottled version (which I would call medium bodied) and somewhat more carbonated.

As I was drinking this I could not come up with a way to describe the taste or smell. Yes my palate is inexperienced, but this was also my first Trippel. It was definitely sweet, but I had a hard time picking out individual flavors. The appearance is a fairly clear gold with a huge fluffy white head, whether you try to pour for the head or not, it's still going to be huge. The taste as I can describe it is only sweet. But you could tell there is the faintest of hops at the very back end which may be Saaz? but really I'm not sure. This bottle was loaded with yeast, and since I had to pour about half the bottle, and then wait to pour the rest, the yeast was stirred up and towards the end what I had was a very cloudy beer with tons of yeast in suspension. That definitely seemed to change the flavor to give it more of a "twang" but it was still good. This was still very enjoyable especially at 8% alcohol you definitely aren't going to be complaining.","MiScusi","Jul 09, 2006"

3.9,-5.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Same 330ml bottle as the blue and red. White label with "Tripel" on it. Tasted at cellar temperature in my chalice glass. Aggressive carbonation right from the cap-popping, this poured loudly into the glass forming a thick off-white head that receded fairly quickly. The beer's colour is amazing: deep nectarine-juice and light orange with the softest hue of caramel-brown. The head is consistent at a thin layer though the tightness seems a little lacking. Good sheets of bubbly lacing. Aroma of white sugar and plenty of phenols. Actually the beer smells very much like the yeast-strain of Unibroue's beers. Sourish malts, green apple, and candy sugar. Dusty malts, with lots of yeasty notes. Some woody, resinous and almost faintly smoky smells in there as well. The aroma is very sugary, but also very salty. A delightful smell, just not as complex as I imagined it would be, and it's a little too high on the sugar notes. The initial smell when the head is full is very good though: kind of like the warming, nearly alcoholic smell of fresh rising bread or even fermenting grapes. The taste is quite extraordinarily bitter from beginning to end. Seriously, the hopping is quite predominant at least in mouthfeel and it leaves a dry but sugary/salty aftertaste. One of the bitterest tripels I have had. Excellent fresh hopping. The malts are supportive, but add only little flavouring. Again, the saccharine sweetness feels just too assertive for this tripel. It becomes a little cloying, and it's all I can seem to feel in the mouth after a while. Some fruity notes come though, such as pear and green grapes. Again, this is tasty, but hardly outstanding as far as Belgian tripels go. Fairly high carbonation and a full body. Drinkable, but the sugar in this beer really does distract from its character. Thank goodness we have the blue and red. For a tripel, this was just a tad disappointing from such a great Trappist brewery, even if they are the biggest and most commercial.","Cwrw","May 26, 2006"

The taste is sweet with pilsener malt and wheat, belgian phenols like bananas and medicine, and a yeasty background. Dry aftertaste, spicy cloves and candi sugar alcohol burn, and faint goldings hop notes. Medium-full body and medium carbonation. A smooth, dry and tart mouthfeel, and flambouyant example of the style. The high sweetness is balanced by the alcoholic bite and solid hop bitterness that presents itself in the finish to combat residual sweetness.

It came highly recomended from the assistant manager, and I must say that I agree in its quality. The bottle appearance is classy with its champaigne style cork closure and the Trappist seal to ensure its quality. The beer smells of cofee and muted bananas with a sweet spice similar to cloves. Phenols are evident but not overpowering. The strain of yeast isolated by "Father Theodore" is definately at the heart of this beer, and provides at taste and aroma that set the standard for this category of beer. The taste is similar to the smell with coffee, muted banana, chocolate, clove and alcohol flavors. The alcohol is muted, and only manifests itself if the brew is allowed to rest too long on the palate. Lingering bitter on the edges of the tounge. Medium to heavy mouthfeel but not syrupy. Medium heavy carbonation and lingering lacing, creamy tan durable head stays with you till the end of the glass.

The first sip is alive with a texture of flavors, including malty sweetness at the tip of the tongue and balancing bitter tastes at the sides and back of the mouth. Along with these dominant sensations are hints of spices. Mouthfeel is pleasantly creamy for a beer that seems so light. The more sips I take, the more flavors seem to come out, and the delicate dance between bitterness and sweetness is decidedly enjoyable, finishing in a very pleasant and lingering bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is fairly high but not overpowering, and warming brings out more subtle flavors. This is the kind of beer one wants to sip slowly and enjoy over a long period of time, which is a good thing as it is also deceptively strong.","Gattopardo","Mar 29, 2006"

This beer pours a hazy orange/gold color that is very appealing to the eye. The aromas wafting from my Duvel chalice are of sweet malts and citrusy/resiny hops. The taste is sweet at first, but then I can detect a little bit of sourness also. There is a slight alcohol taste, but otherwise this beer is very drinkable.

The tart hops were in effect and once I poured the yeast into the mix it helped things out a but but oveall a bland yet drinkable beer. Worth the price? no.

Very bold and interesting, but not on par with the best tripels in terms of complexity. Taste is bitter upfront, lots of spicy hops and coriander. Apple, buttery tones, and a bit of breadiness make an appearance in the middle before the alcohol becomes apparent in the finish. Very dry. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with good carbonation.

Citrus and yeast also contributed by the mid. There was a slightly rough alcohol flavour and burn at the end, followed by a peppery finish with lingering hops. As it warmed to room temperature, this roughness disappeared. The high carbonation seemed to add some acidity. Light bodied with a bit of slickness and aggressive alcohol warmth overall.

Prior to the abyss, a nice balance resides with smooth lightly toasty malts, nice melange of fruits and spice, and a tiny bit of hops.

The beer boasted a big 1 1/2", chunky head that dissipated a few minutes after being served. The aroma was overall excellent with some excellent fruit tones and a layer of spiciness. The flavor began with a fruity tartness that ends with a very well balanced hoppiness. The finish also leaves a hint of the alcohol flavor there too, but it's not as apparent as an 8.0 ABV beer could be. The mouthfeel was of a medium body, which doesn't hinder or help the drinkability of the beer, which is on the higher side because of the tastiness and excellent aroma of the beer.

Upfront I taste fruit bitterness followed closely by spices and the intensity of the spices mixing with the carbonation.

Nice flavors, but not quite as full and complex as some other great tripels I've had. Medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation, and a nice creamy mouthfeel.

The taste is very complex and begins with a spiced (again, nutmeg, corriander, and clove) and medicinal character upfront and follows with a fruity, yeasty character with hints of lemon rind and granny smith apples, and then a mild hop-tea like hops to balance out the malt. Very interesting, complex and well constructed but overall not a standout. I think the spice gives way to phenolic flavors too easily and the beer suffers.

Light alcohol touch provides a rather heating character, very herbal, moderately hoppy, grassy. Decent honeyish malt base on the tongue though it fades into an extremely dry finish. This wants to be westmalle tripel a bit too much for its own good, but it doesnt even come close in the mouthfeel department where this one seems a bit overcarbonated, bubbly even and medium bodied at most. It certainly has an irony quality to it, or at least very mineralic, which I sometimes appreciate, but it didnt seem to fit with the alcohol in here. Finish is hoppy, salty. Decent take on the style.","Rastacouere","Nov 08, 2004"

The aroma is very sweet and fruity, almost like a maple syrup or a molasses, with some slight tart notes. The flavor was a bit subdued over the bottle. Very dry mouthfeel, almost astringent, and the tastes tend to linger for a while. The end result is a pleasant tripel, and a very drinkable one at that.

There are some nice tropical and white fruits (pineapple, peach), as well as some coriander and pepper spiciness making a brief appearance in a long, lingering, bitter aftertaste.

While there was elegance, and refined tastes in a beer that has roots in a deep and deservedly respected tradition; it seems that Chimay Wit pales in comparison to the intense, poetic, and wild triples I have pursued. Certainly, the golden ale looks lovely beneath fingers of foam. The hints of banana and clove are pleasant, but cloying. The flavor is nice, but it lacks a sense of adventure. There's nothing to drive me wild, or entrance me with the style as I've found in CBC's triple threat or in Epluche Cullotte. I want stark, mad poetry of flavor.","AllThingsNinja","Aug 08, 2004"

Its a cloudy yellow-orange colored liquid with an initially enormous head (that quickly settles into an ever-present thin layer). The aroma is yeasty and phenolic. Theres a touch of fruit (apple and berries?), and just a little alcohol. As you taste it, at first the beer seems soft and subtle, but quickly becomes peppery and crisp, with a bitter backbone. Theres a hint of alcohol in the taste, and a solid yeast taste. Moderate carbonation (maybe less than usual for a Belgian). Sweetness is restrained.

Aroma of flowers and citrus and candi sugar from a foot away. Belgian yeast smell is present, but not dominant, with a slight earthiness. Mostly fruit and sweet, maybe a bit like walking through an herb garden. Flavor: malti-goodness, crisp, and a little earthy that ends in moderate tartness. Bitter ending. The flavor has a nice beginning and middle, but ending leaves an off-flavor tongue coating that is not enjoyable. Too much earthiness and mustiness. I will admit, though, that this improves as one works one's way through the bottle. Mouthfeel is decent, but that tongue coating is not pleasant.

The hue was almost similar to oak, a mix of oranges and browns. Somewhat sedimenty and a quick foamy top. Aroma is sweet and applesque. Taste is very round, a well built malt body with pales and bisquits, and a slight, minimal fruity yeast taste. The taste was surprisingly mellow when compared to a local triple, though much more refined and much better balanced. Drank nicely and would have made a great dinner compliment, though 12oz is just about the ideal serving.","freed","Sep 22, 2003"

This beer has a slightly sweet and fruity smell and that is followed up by the taste of malt and caramel and spice. The taste of the spices and slight yeast and sweetness were very well balanced together. While this is a very good beer in its own right I prefer the Red and Blue.

The spice starts off the flavor, too, in a really lovely way  strong but not at all overpowering. It seems right at place throughout the whole sip.

The taste is a start of malt and then a wash of the yeast flavors. There was a slight hint of fruit in the taste. A smooth drinking brew but watch out, there is alcohol in there and it will creep up on you. There is a nice dry finish with this beer.

Large, somewhat carbonated head, which lasts throughout. Alcohol not noticed in the taste, but definitely in the buzz. Somewhat yeasty, but quite appealing (I wish I had one more glass tonight!).

This brew has a very light amber color with some particles floating around in it. It also has a very mild aroma that is hard to notice. It reminded me of nothing in particular. The carbonation rolled off my tongue yet the taste was mostly of that carbonation with a mild fore and after taste. I liked the taste though. This is a beer I could get drunk on. Lets see if it has the stomach upsetting qualities that some of the other Chimayan ales have had. Time will tell. GF gave it a 4.1 rating. She said she could drink it all night long.

Plenty spicy palate, peppery then tart balanced with an array of sweetness  honey-like mainly. The tartness reemerges to mix with a sugary-acidity. Gorgeous carbonation allows a fulfilling and enjoyable mouthfeel to develop.

Taste was grainy, slightly citrus like flavors. Alcohol and faded yeasty combinations mellow. Overall a slightly hot, harsh grainy taste. Some sweet malted flavors come back and forth. Medium bodied, hard to have more than a sip at time. I have heard the bigger bottles with the cork and cage taste better, I might try it in those bottles, but this was such a dissapointment it will be hard to pull the trigger on the big bottle.

The aroma and taste are very hard to pin down. You can smell this beer from quite a distance.It seems to be yeasty,fruity, and little floral. The taste starts with a little malt sweetness,a flowery hop flavor, and nice bitter finish, but as it warms,the fizzines of the carbonation subsides to give you a more creamy, toasted malt flavor with a long nice earthy bitterness in the finish.

Relatively mild aroma with hints of bananas and cloves. Very nice taste, not at all overwhelming though. I was struck by the sweet malts, with an understated taste of yeast.

If you are planning on trying different styles of beers at the same time - either cleanse your palate with some water or drink this one 1st.

Spicy and almost rind-like bitterness hits the front of the tongue first with pepper in tow. The hops are very apparent in this one, which is kind of unusual for Belgian beers in my experience. A bit of yeast in the middle. Fruity as well, a bit like grapefruit. Grain-like maltiness is present underneath all of this at all times, but it's a different kind of grainy than with most beers that have this characteristic. Combines uniquely with the hops. Complexities are hard to pick out, the nose suggested more than are present. Smooth and creamy yet sharp and tingly mouthfeel. Although I find the hops a little out of place, this is a great tripel and a great beer overall. Not the most drinkable, but still above average in that department.

4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very nice aroma that I could not identify single smells in.  Every time I thought I smelled something, a new odor would come out.  Gold in color with a nice white head.  Slightly sweet and slightly bitter but overall very spicy and zesty.  Very enjoyable indeed.","jreitman","Aug 24, 2002"
4.45,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pale with a touch of orange and a nice thick pale sheen on the brew.  Strong alcohol/yeast/slightly sweet nose.  Very smooth mouth with the taste of white pepper, and a touch of lemon.  As it warms it becomes more hoppy/fruity.  This is the classic belgian white....","frank4sail","Aug 15, 2002"
4.87,17.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Hazy but w/out the large sediment normally found in the bottled version. Peachy in color w/ a fine creamy head that slowly dies to a 1/16", but leaves an excellent lace throughout the goblet. The aroma is somewhat chameleon-like in it's changing nature. In many ways, this defines the entire beer.The aroma is loaded w/ yeast, spice, sugary hints, light fruit and fresh hop. Coming & going are light aromas of raisin, orange, apricot, peach, honey, wild flowers, citrus, coriander, and pepper. The body is medium & the mouthfeel is creamy soft -almost cottony- due to the fine (but high level) of carbonation. Very lively but not sharp. The flavor wanders much like the aroma, varying it's intensity between sweetness, yeastiness, spiciness, acidity and bitter qualities. The flavors starts gently spicy and zesty w/ some hop bite, and an occasional flash of lightly sour acidity, eventually softening as it warms and loses carbonation, allowing more alcohol, sweetness and yeastiness to dominate. As you go through the glass these characteristics interact in different ways, giving it complexity. The finish is generally spicy and hoppy, w/ a quenching acidity and lingering yeastiness - although some more sweetness and fruit appears to linger towards the end of the serving. Firm, dry & hoppy w/ complexity. Not challenging, but interesting. The draft version clearly appears fresher, almost w/ a brighter taste, and is missing some of the mustiness of the bottles.","NeroFiddled","Aug 12, 2002"
4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer has a hint of apples and bananas. The balance of fruit, alcohol and bitterness is well balanced and complex. So far this is one of the best belgium beers I've tasted so far!","BeerManDan","Aug 06, 2002"
4.28,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A rather yeasty, estery nose leads to a rather spicy, fruity start - apple, coriander, bitter orange, hints of banana... Very nicely complex. As the sip goes on the alcohol & bitterness come to the forefront and round things out a bit. It finishes spicy, warming, with undertones of the aforementioned fruits.  A rather "tingly" mouthfeel is the only distraction.   As the brew warms, this dissipates and the bitterness in the brew increases.  Very enjoyable sipping brew.","sponberg","Aug 01, 2002"

4.47,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The appearance is a slight a cloudy orange color almost glowing. The head is super smooth, slightly sticky but leaves a perfect sheet of lace. On the nose there are aromas of orange peels, pepper, and a slight citrus aroma. More and the same on the palate, fruity, orange peels, coriander, peppery, nicely sweet, slightly tart as well, just well rounded and balanced! Excellent brew!","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 22, 2002"
4.09,-1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Spicy and peppery are the key words here. An interesting brew, something quite out of the ordinary - but given the choice, I would most definitely still prefer the Chimay Blue.","Sigmund","May 29, 2002"

4.67,13.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This bottle had a date on the cork of 03-2000, yeast sediment still seemed a bit unsettled. Hazed golden straw with a very active carbonation that holds the firm white lace together. Ripe apple skin and medicinal aroma with some pale grainy malt and earthy yeast. Richly textured with the ultra smooth and highly crisp mouth feel, carbonation is high though it is the perfect fixture and helps a bit in drinkability. Hop bitterness is quick but somewhat potent which is followed by an earthy yeast that has a soft powdery quality to it. Big fruitiness, with bold yet suitable alcoholic esters that don’t get too flamboyant. Alcohol is a bit illusory, you know its there but not at the 8.0% level. Grainy maltiness with hints of raw orange blossom honey and a good dose of medicinal phenols. Touch of sweetness upfront but eternally dry in the finish. This bottle has peaked and I am glad I had it now and not later down the road.","Jason","Apr 21, 2002"
3.92,-5.1,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"A good triple, slightly on the dry side, must be poured very slowly - serious carbonation, head never dissipates completely.  Very complex beer with slightly hoppy finish.","jdhilt","Apr 14, 2002"
4.3,4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Chimay sets the standard for Belgian tripel. A nicy foamy head leaves lace all the way down the glass. Light fruit aroma and flavor becomes more pronounced as it sits in the glass. It's also very drinkable. Nice work, boys. In hindsight, I haven't come back to his beer as often as I though I would.","mickeymac","Apr 14, 2002"
4.59,11.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The head is very dense and persistent, and leaves a true Belgian lace down the tulip glass.  The aroma is superlative and complex. Acetaldehyde (green apple) and unripe pear notes hits the nose at first, a pronounced clean fructose - like sweetness follows, finishing with a estery lemony tartness and trace phenol and fusel alcohol.  The meager hop nose is lost amongst the complex estery aroma.  A honey - like sweetness bathes the tip of the tongue, but more complex caramelized sugars and light acidity round everything out.  Mild toasty malt is noticeable and adds to the complexity of this brew.  Subdued biscuity notes can be discerned as well, adding yet another layer of flavors.  Hop bitterness and flavor is paltry and would've gotten in the way of other flavors.  Cinq Cents is medium in body and very smooth in mouthfeel, yet retains a crispness that lends excellent drinkability.   It finishes with a very pleasant alcohol warmth and yeasty mustiness.  Complex, yet soft.  Delicious!  The alcohol strength is superbly hidden.  The 750 ml and 11 oz. bottles can be very different... I'm updating my review after tasting a 750.  Although fairly young (bottled 10/01) the overall balance is superb.  The real deal.","marc77","Apr 06, 2002"
4.47,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Anyway what can I say about this beer that hasn't already been better said below?  I tried the 33cl size bottle.  Pours with a large white head, well carbonated.  Clear dark golden yellow color.  Smells very yeasty/fruity.  Medium body.  A fairly sweet beer to start but finishes dry and slightly bitter.  The alcohol seems more pronounced in the finish as well, you notice it but it's not over powering.","htomsirveaux","Mar 26, 2002"
4.58,10.9,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Wow.  I think that the Monks at this abbey have apparently gotten very close with god.  How else are their beers so consistently amazing?  This brew pours a clear golden with a frothy thick head that maintains all the way down.  A slight bitterness, with alcohol and fruity flavors coming in.  Very crisp and highly drinkable.","Murph","Feb 17, 2002"
4.73,14.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"An exceptional brew from Chimay. Hazy, golden appearance with a dense off white head. Fruity aroma and a fine, prickly carbonation level, but considerably smoother than other trippels that are too champagne like. Peppery yeast spiciness pricks at the taste buds. Malt sweetness and fruitiness (subtle grape and apricot?) in the middle. Alcohol warming sensation is pleasant and not overwhelming. Delicious.","John","Jan 28, 2002"
