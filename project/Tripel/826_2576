4.99,20.5,4.75,5,5,5,5,"Pours hazy gold with a thick, pillowy 2’ or more thick white foam cap that perches above the rim of the glass and produces intricate Belgian lace with each sip. The palate features yeast driven esters and phenolics – light spicy fruit – suspended in a airy yet creamy malty emulsion. The body is light for a beer this size and delightfully creamy. Slightly sweet but very well balanced and not cloying. The 9% alcohol is smooth and deceptive with a gentle warming the only warning of its presence. A 750 ml bottle is the perfect accompaniment for an evening when you do not need to go anywhere.","pat61","Jan 25, 2015"

Smell is of malt, grain, honey, fruit, spice, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice honey and fruit aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 22, 2013"

Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, grape, apple, pear, pepper, herbal, clove, banana, honey, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance. Taste of big lemon, pear, banana, pepper, clove, herbal, candi sugar, bread, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance; with no cloying flavors at all as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick, foamy, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden for 9%, with pretty much no warming on the finish at all. Overall this is an outstanding Tripel! Fantastic flavor complexity with great balance; and very smooth to sip on.

Significant amount of clingy lace all around the glass. Sweet aroma riddled with spice like clove and fruit similar to pears and apples. Some alcohol thrown into the aroma as well to mix it up. Taste is sweet upfront tasting like pear/apple and clove. Tiny bit of hop bitterness keeping the sweetness in check. Somewhat dry finish that is quite warming. Medium to light feel and highly carbed.

Overall this beer had a nice, clean scent and taste with a fairly smooth body. But it wasn't very complex or bold, or unique in any way.

Smooth, creamy, light to medium bodied and with great carbonation almost has a white wine/champagne feel. Taste and body are almost chewey with some sweet malts balanced with pear, citric and apple fruit notes with a crisp, sharp finish thanks to some herbal hop bitterness. This tripel is both fruity and sweet and dry and sour at the same time - they really pull off a balancing act.

The taste is semi-sweet, with a Belgian yeast flavor and lots of pale malt. There's also a warming that borders on hotness, and isn't really well placed.

Apples, pears, and grape flavors are noted. Some earthiness is tasted as the ale warms and opens up. Is not overly sweet and finishes neutral. Alcohol is very well hiddened.

Taste is pretty sweet, with just a touch of hop bitterness that doesn't do enough to balance things out. There's a creaminess to the mouthfeel that combines with the sweetness of the palate to make things unpleasantly sweet.

Despite this, I tried to decant as best as I could. The beer pours a translucent gold with lots of chunks floating around. It is topped with a creamy, 1 finger head that leaves huge patches of lace and retains an 1/8 inch blanket of foam. Smell is sweet with spices (pepper, cloves), lots of fruits (banana, lemon, grapes, some tropical), and powdery yeast. Flavors include lots of piney hops and yeast up front with banana, lemon, and a bit of grape following behind. It finishes with a subtle hop bitterness.

Very easy going, light and airy in the mouth with a light astringency in the finish that really strips the tongue. Very good, but there are too many others I prefer. This beer begs to be paired with something, and seems to wobble a bit by itself.","jlervine","Jul 05, 2004"

3.92,-5.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Golden in colour, very lively - the head looks like an ice cream cone even after careful pouring, and it was emerging from the bottle the moment the cap was removed. Cloudy in the glass due to the internal turbulence when the bottle was opened. Mellow fruity aroma, hints of spices too. The predominately malty flavour is assisted by hints of candi sugar, not overwhelming but pleasant. Not as much aftertaste as I would have liked. Nice enough but nothing truly special.","Imbiber","Mar 11, 2004"
3.98,-3.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"the carbonation is crisply effervescant and active in the mouth. it's body is thinner (and cleaner) than what i expected, perhaps even a tad watery but this serves this beer uniquely well. the drinkability rating also seems to prosper from the lighter body as it never seems too much.","pio","Mar 06, 2004"
4.45,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sampled from a 750ml bottle. Pours a hazy medium-golden color with a tall and frothy bright white head that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving behind a thick and rocky lace. Nose is Belgian spice and fruit with additional notes of honey and perfume. Medium in body with a strong active carbonation that at first makes it seem that it is lighter than it actually is. Taste begins sweet with lots of fruit (mango, tangerine, apple, pear, kiwi, and honeydew) followed by some spicy notes of clove, coriander, and white pepper as well as some dry yeast. Somewhat mild bitter hops with some acidic citrusy notes appear toward the end along with a trace amount of alcohol (very well hidden for a 9% ABV brew). A very nice Triple here and one that Im quite sure Ill be buying more of in the near future.","Morris729","Feb 06, 2004"

3.93,-5.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Clear, gold/orange/yellow, huge carbonation, cloudy last pour. Big, off-white, dense head leaving thick, sticky, huge, foamy clumps. A nutty, sweetish nose. A sweet, spicy, fruity front... somewhat grassy. Buttery, sweet and thick in the middle; alcoholic and nicely bitter in the creamed-corn finish. This is clean, strong, fruity, spicy. A good, straight-ahead, Belgian ale.","kbub6f","Nov 05, 2003"

4.4,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,5,"This triple from Abbaye du Val-Dieu has a nice a nice orangy gold tint with a fair amount of haze. Head retention isn't great but it had a nice fluffy head. Sweetness is present in the aroma, like smelling hard candy and a swedish fish[?] type of sweetness on the tongue followed by another sweetness closer to anise or black licorice finishing with an earthy dryness. Very nice; I like this triple. It's clear that it has around the average strength of a triple at 9%. Nice carbonation out of the 33 cl bottle.","crookedhalo","Sep 28, 2003"

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I bought a bomber bottle, and it poured a nice gold color with a 1" head in my Chimay glass. The carbonation was strong, and there was a floral yeasty aroma to the beer. The aroma translated into the flavor on the tongue, with a slight bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp, and there was a mellow yeast aftertaste. The alcohol was not overpowering, and this was one of the mildest tripels I have consumed.","Gavage","Sep 21, 2003"

4.35,5.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Am tasting it as I write this. Pours out golden with a small tight head. Smell is malty and fruity, with a little honey overtone. Taste is delightful, honey, malt, citrus and pears. A mesmerizing melange of flavors combine in this beautiful brew. An absolute delight to drink. The mouthfeel is superb and dangerously drinkable for a 9% beer. Marvelous.","euskera","Jul 30, 2003"
4.12,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall I found this beer to be a little disapointing. Still a wonderful triple, it just didn't seem to be well balanced. The hop bitterness dominated a bit too much for me.","taez555","Jul 26, 2003"

3.83,-7.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Golden orange colored body, full of CO2 surging through the beer. Big, thick, dense, creamy, white head. Excellent head retention, lots of lace on the glass. After head settles a bit, begins to look like a float. Smell is sweet and spicy, with a strong grassy/herbal smell. Lots of coriander and orange noticeable. Taste is a bit thinner than expected, but very good. Grassy malt base, with very prominent spices and citrus. Noticeable, but not strong flavor of alcohol present. Mild, but persistent and spicy aftertaste. Moderate-bodied brew, surprisingly smooth considering the huge amount of carbonation. A very good triple, but not one o my favorites.","Viking","May 19, 2003"
4.25,2.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer scared me shitless. I was expecting a little pop from the cork, but upon opening, it sounded like an M-80 went off in the kitchen. The color is orange-ish and golden. A tight, medium-sized head graces the top of the beer. Aromas of fruit -- and, I think, Starfruit gatorade? -- and some spiciness, the kind that gives your nose a little tingle. It's pretty flavorful -- the sometimes overpowering candy sweetness of a tripel is a blended nicely with citrus, mango, pear, and other fruit basket flavors and is finished with a nice, sweeping, spicy-pepper kick at the end that wipes up the tongue. Very easy to drink; I polished mine off quickly.","marburg","May 10, 2003"

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a very slightly hazy golden with a large clingy, creamy, white head that is heavily effervescent. The mouthfeel is moderate to slightly firm with tingly bubbles. The smell is all malt and spice(clovelike?). The taste is slightly earthy sweet malt going to strong alcohol with a very mild hop finish. This is a very nice pale strong assertive triple.","fattyre","Mar 26, 2003"
3.5,-15.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light gold to straw yellow in color. Not much head to speak of other than a slight white outer ring of fine lace. Slightly under carbonated with a few little bubbles. Flatness hurts the mouth but it is a smooth brew on the palate. Not a ton of nose but there is a honey sweetness detected. The taste enforces the honey theme as well as a dry tartness that is left on the tongue. The mouth is left with a film of honey and floral hoppiness. The brew is good but a little too sweet and undercarbonated to truly make me want to come back again and again.","frank4sail","Feb 18, 2003"

As it sets in the Val Dieu glass the body a slightly nebulous golden orange color and its crown a prominent fluffy white head, the lace thick sticky sheets that weld themselves to the glass. Lime like tartness hits you first, crisp and fresh, the malt underlies it, quite appealing to the senses. Malt and somewhat sweet at the start with the top medium in feel and the finish is middling in its carbonation and the hops quite spicy in their bite, dry and tart aftertaste that has a touch of alcohol bitterness, a quite quaffable beer that is worth the effort to find and sample, in my humble opinion that is.","Gusler","Jan 06, 2003"
3.77,-8.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Okay, this baby was worse than champagne when I uncorked it. I thought it would never stop foaming. If formed a cloudy gold color with quite a bit of sediment present and some carbonation, but hard to tell how much through the sediment. A small bubbly white head that didn't hold despite the previous explosion and it left circular lace. An aroma of citrus and fruit with some bread/yeast elements. A flavor of citrus and fruit with some elements of the alcohol present. Others have really liked this Triple, but I find it to be not as special as some of the others I have tried. Maybe it requires a bit of age to mature.","Wildman","Dec 18, 2002"

4.41,6.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beautiful, slightly hazy golden color with a big creamy white head that leaves a great lace all the way down my chalice.  Very spicy aroma with a lot of pepper and clove and some others that I cannot identify.  There is also a sweet candy smell as well as some light fruity esters of  orange zest, light banana and other light fruits.  The extreme spiciness of the aroma is somewhat calmed although still very noticeable in the taste.  Still some nice pepper and light clove.  The sweetness of the candy sugar comes through some more as well as some slightly biscuity malt qualities.  The orangey fruitiness is still present as is a little bit of some other fruity esters.  There is a nice warming alcohol effect as well.  This brew is very smooth and carbonated just perfectly for excellent drinkability.  Damn I love Belgian Tripels and this is a great one.","Murph","Sep 19, 2002"
4.36,5.3,5,4,4,5,5,"Brilliantly clear golden hue when decanted off the sediment. Topped by a densely bubbled expanding head that eventually tames into a seemingly static thick layer.  Intricate, fractal like lace is left.  Honey topped rustic bread, clove, ripe citrus and a hint of heaty fusels in aroma.  Fruity, slightly cidery sweetness initially in flavor, is quickly ensued by pleasantly peppery, spicy alcohol and musty esters.  Sweetness then becomes akin to raw honey and when coupled with the light hop bitterness and tangerine fruitiness, a honey drizzled orange impression is left.  Moderately bodied, with a silky smooth mouthfeel.   Yeast contributions in flavor are light, but subdued clove phenol and trace bubblegum are perceptible.  Hop bitterness is meager, but manages to balance the low residual sweetness because of the high attenuation.  Finishes slightly sweet w/ a light mineral note, but otherwise clean.  Satisifying mellow alcohol warmth coats the throat slowly.  Val Dieu exhibits incredible depth and balance all around.  Perhaps one of the most smooth, refined, and deceivingly drinkable tripels available.  Superb control of overall sweetness.  Absolutely delicious and outstanding.  I'm updating my review.  The 750 ml is far superior to the 11.2 oz bottle.","marc77","Jul 31, 2002"
4.57,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Notes: Incredibly easy to drink and dangerous at that being a triple. Very well balanced with a clean palate even with the esters and phenols running around the taste buds.","Jason","Apr 24, 2002"
