The balance was great, the mouthfeel addictive, and the alcohol was well-hidden.

3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into chalice, 2012 vintage. Pours moderately cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, pear, apple, peach, clove, pepper, honey, bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of big apricot, pear, apple, peach, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, honey, biscuit, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a nice yeast/malt sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice tripel style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

My comments seem critical, and maybe I was expecting this to be better, but the reviews are mixed, so maybe this is one of those that everybody has a different opinion over. I'm just doing this to try to improve my tasting abilities, esp with the belgians. I expected to like it better than MM, but I think MM will still be my standby (not saying there aren't better tripels, but easy access to Weyerbacher products here and they're always reliably excellent). But I'm very close between Black Tulip and MM and wouldn't be the least bit disappointed if I went somewhere that only had BT but not MM. Certainly worth trying and seeing who's review you agree with.","irs","May 30, 2013"

Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, medium bodied, finishes spicy with a sharp tingle on the tongue. Alcohol is undetectable in taste, but is warming. Aftertaste is somewhat odd, yet pleasant, presumably the tulip flavor lingering. It's not off-putting, just different. Overall, I really enjoyed this unique ale. It's seems light and refreshing, yet it's bold with the high ABV. Flavors meld perfectly. I've had other beers brewed with flowers, and never really liked them much as the flower was overwhelming.

This beer didn't have good drinkability, the sweetness and booze made it not that smooth and the flavors just couldn't hold my attention, one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both very true to style and nicely done. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, too sweet and a little bland, pretty rough around the edges. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have Arbor's Phat Abbot, it's cheaper and much better tasting. I was a little let down with this beer, I was expecting a nice Tripel, and that's what I got till I got to the taste, then it went down hill. I had their Beer Hive Tripel and didn't care for it, and this one seemed to follow suit but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Beer Hive. In my opinion Phat Abbot is still the best Michigan made Tripel. New Holland can make some pretty good beers, but when it comes to Tripel's they always fall short, maybe this style just isn't for you guys, better luck next time.","StoutHunter","May 29, 2012"

4.03,3.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This poured a clear dark gold with some white head. It smelled like a typical trippel with dominant sour wild yeast and lemon hops, with light copper and grassy malts. It tasted like sour lemon and metallic copper hops, with surprisingly strong barley and caramel malt and bready yeast. It was moderately thick with some smooth carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this was a nicely enjoyable trippel. It smelled pretty sour, but the taste was much more malty and balanced. That, along with a great silky body and fairly well hidden alcohol, made this very easy to drink. It wasn't very complex or delicate compared to some other pale Belgians, but I really liked it, especially on a summer evening.","Pencible","Jul 08, 2009"

On the nose, I get an aroma of more honey, but it's interlaced with some gingerale, orange and hoppy bitterness. On the palate, this beer is quite rich, sweet and complex. I get honey, butter, orange, maraschino cherry, flowers and some very noticeable hoppy bitterness. The bitterness helps to counter the sweetness in this beer very well, giving some welcome balance to this medium bodied beer. Alcohol is pretty well disguised and drinkability is pretty good (though the somewhat excessive sweetness detracts a bit from this beer's drinkability). There's also something of an odd bitterness in the finish as well and it doesn't seem to be from hops. Nevertheless, this is a solid, interesting to drink beer that I'm glad to have had an opportunity to try.","John_M","Feb 18, 2009"

The color of the pour looked good with a pale golden, hazy body, but the carbonation was pathetic for the style, and formed nearly no head at all. The smell was good with a mix of light perfume and booze. The was good to start off as there was hop bitterness, yeasty earthiness, and some funk, but mid sip the honeydew melon like sweetness took over the taste. The finish was spicy-bitter-earthy, but a little too short lived. The body felt right in terms of viscosity, but the relative lack of carbonation made it feel dull and less full of zest. The brewery gave this a decent effort, but came up just a little short.","rajendra82","Aug 30, 2008"

This beer makes its presence felt: very distinctive aroma and flavor profile. Plenty of ester and resin on the nose with some orchard fruit.

Creamy head looked great from the start but faded quickly, maintaining a presence just around the edges of the glass throughout consumption. Black tulip had a clean nose but with some citrus and tangerine plus flowery hop aromas. First sip: very full, sweet body with citrus and tangerine persisting and some pleasant hops to round it out at the end. These characteristics were pretty much consistent for the whole glass, though the hop presence faded a bit. My main complaint would be that it seemed to lack a bit of complexity and didnt change much as I drank. It did taste good with those buffalo steaks though.","BabaJohn","Sep 11, 2007"

This one is slightly under-carbonated, but the mouth feel is complemented by the complexity achieved with the coriander spice and almost syrupy sweet flavors. Instead of being dry, this one's sweetness lingers some. I like this a lot, but i can say that it's on the edge of style. Hey, drink what's right for you.

The taste does do a pretty good job of covering the alcohol until the very end. It starts out much like the smell, sweet with Belgian sugar and a bit of spice, transitioning to the hop presence and finishes very dry and with a definite strong alcohol bite. After a few drinks into the beer, the alcohol presence isn't as noticeable. The mouthfeel is fairly light in body but it has a dense carbonation that makes the beer feel heavier.

Fruity esters abound in the nose and flavors. Lightly peppery, spicy, and alcoholicly hot, but tempered with pilner malts, fruity sweetness, and a dull hop flavor. Mildly tart and thinning into the finish leaving a dry alcoholic vaporation on the toung.

This beer could be so much more if the flavors were upped and the carbonation was doubled. Mellow mouthfeel was slightly creamy and filling. Good drinkability.

3.45,-11.5,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Appearance: Semi-cloudy golden sunburst hue big bubbly whitehead forms thick leaving bands of lacing down my glass. Aroma: Herbal grassy hop blend along with a great touch of citrus fruit and honey candy sweet malts pleasant blend of cloves and spiciness. Taste: A tart forefront that rolls a little bumpy down my palate, the spices come about with some hop bitterness playing a role on the flavor with some citrus and tropical fruit notes not bad but definitely not straight Belgian trippel style. Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly syrupy nice brew, carbonation is heavy in comparison to a true tripel. Drinkability: Well, I look at this as a creative representatin of a triple so not dead on for the style but it's flavorful and complex but the tartness would nudge me away from drinking this very often.","WVbeergeek","May 24, 2004"
3.75,-3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a small bubbly white head that left trace lace as is subsided. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, malt, clove with a hint of grain. A flavor of malt, clove and banana with a touch of grain present. The finish is a touch soft and astrigent. As far as tripels, it's not bad for an American, but the Belgians shouldn't worry.","Wildman","May 22, 2004"

3.69,-5.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Quite a surprise for a Trippel: tastes different. Ample head, smells like freshly peeled or sliced sugar cane: that blend of sweetness and vegetal overtone? Not as yeasty nor as full-bodied as most Belgian or American trippels, it has a different flavor profile and progression. Starts out with that blend of crispiness and creaminess you look forward to in a trippel but shades into a smoothness piqued by an orange (?) or tangerine (?) hint. Needs a bit more carbonation. Different enough to warrant attention and satisfaction, but value-wise, there are more traditional tasting trippels in the same price range with more complexity.","marcellaproust","May 11, 2004"
3.83,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, a very good beer that's a little lighter than most Trippels but is great for a warm summer evening!","mikes2923","May 10, 2004"
3.85,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours out to a solid, gold color in the glass with a minimal head and lacing. The aroma is that of fresh bread, butter and yeast. The taste reflects a light Beligian yeast profile. Not as strong taste-wise as other trippels I have tasted. However, this is a good thing as its an easy-to-drink version. There is some caramel taste present and a slight bitterness on the swallow. Reminds me of a lighter version of Unibroue's Maudite, albeit much lighter. ABV well hidden.","proc","May 03, 2004"

3.62,-7.2,3.5,4,4,2.5,3,"Mouthfeel is a bit low. The carbonation is sharp and is quite abrasive, not a smooth beer by any means, but it makes up for it in taste and smell. Despite the poor feel to this, I could still see having a couple of these in one sitting.","Skidz","Apr 23, 2004"
3.5,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Deep hazy ruby amber color with a small head of large bubbles that doesn't last, not much lacing, sweet candy and flower aromas. Dry fruity and nutty-vanilla flavors. Medium to full body with a full and creamy mouthfeel, finishes very dry. The alcohol is not really noticeable though I expect to be on the high side.","maxpower","Apr 03, 2004"
4.27,9.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a smaller sized creamy, white head. Smell is strong in yeast and also had a nutty and spicyness to it. The taste was really nice and complex but not overbearing by any means. Went down too easily. A honey sweetness is prevalent then a fruity flavor comes. The base seems wheaty almost bread like. Spicy herbal hops hit towards to end but are not too strong. Belgian yeast is more noticeable the further I go. Dry finish. Very good!","granger10","Mar 21, 2004"

3.62,-7.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium yellow, light carbonation and not much head. Simple but adequate lace. Sweet aromas, a bit of real maple sugar. A little thick to the tongue, mid range sweet in the orange juice realm. A prickly finish helps redeem it as a Trippel, reminds me most strongly of a peppery leaf lettuce. Decent beer, a little more jazzy carbonation and yeasty qualities would have filled out the bill better to me.","ADR","Sep 07, 2003"
2.65,-32.1,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Flavor: It's a little spicy with a some bite, but all in all, for a trippel, it's a bit thin. There are many far better trippels out there in my opinion.","jcalabre","Aug 06, 2003"

This one will get a second look to see if I just got a bad example.","Sixpack595","Jun 09, 2003"
4.52,15.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Comparing the new to the old label, this one tends to have a little less bite and is smoother with minimal sourness, which I miss. I haven't tasted an American brewed trippel quite like this before, and I give props to New Holland BC for being experimental. They have brewed a wonderful trippel here. For not much more $ than a 6'er of Bud, you're getting a hell of a lot more beer. I will be drinking many more of these in the future for sure. Highly impressed!","Mitchster","Jan 17, 2003"
3.33,-14.6,4.5,4,3,3,3,"Bouquet of pancakes smothered in berry syrup, a spring flower arrangement and a touch of basement. Honeyed golden under a tight lacing head. A deep tart and fruity sweetness blankets the buds while spicy hops try to crawl under and snuggle up but eventually smother and die in bitter spite. Well-carbonated yet still coats the mouth. Not bad, but the aftertaste kills it halfway through.","inebrius","Jan 13, 2003"
3.48,-10.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Gold to orange in color.  Chill haze present.  Aroma is of pineapple and orange juice.  Little evidence of maltiness or cloves in araoma.  First sip reveals sweetness with some hops bitterness.  I don't pick up much spiciness that would lend to more complexity. Tastes like drinking pineapple juice with some bitterness.  Not very high in carbonation that I believe is desirable in this style.  Candi sugar is evident.  Beer reveals a little more after allowing to warm.   Still the sweetness seems to mask any spiciness.","mjohn27603","Nov 09, 2002"
