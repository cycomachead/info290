3.99,3.4,4.25,4,3.75,4.75,4,"Put on tap in my home tap.  Cask conditioned so nice and bubbly but has a very creamy nice mouthfeel.  Beautiful cloudy tripel color.  Initial smell is of bananas with a little bit of pear.  Tastes like banana bubble gum.  Very complex flavor and a nicely made beer.  Flavor is clearly driven by the yeast which is appropriate for the style.  Booze is present but not overpowering flavor.  A good domestic tripel but if banana is not your preference for the dominant flavor in a belgian style then pick a different tripel (such as Fin Du Monde)","BigH75","Mar 20, 2015"

3.89,0.8,3.75,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it had just about everything that I look for in the style with no off flavors and the mouthfeel was pretty well done.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's fairly smooth, crisp, a little creamy, well hidden alcohol, not too filling and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, It might start to wear on me a little if I have more than that.  What I like the most about this beer is the mouthfeel and aroma, they are both good and I think they are the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but it was a little rough around the edges.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend giving it a try if your a fan of the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer, for an american brewed Tripel it was good and it seemed to be better than most.  It isn't a favorite beer from this brewery, but I do think it's one of the better American brewed tripels that I've had.  NIce job guys, this was a nice tripel, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 02, 2015"

4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 10/29/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, apricot, banana, pepper, clove, coriander, wheat, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear, apricot, apple, banana, pepper, clove, coriander, candi sugar, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, apricot, banana, pepper, clove, coriander, candi sugar, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is great. A good amount of dryness as well. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

The alcohol is hidden very well and will sneak up on you though so be careful.","WhiteHillsStore","Nov 15, 2014"

No single flavor stands out, or so I felt, but, by and large, it tasted really good. By far the beer's best attribute is its feeling in one's mouth. It feels very creamy, but not too creamy, not too much like cough syrup or something. It drives that fine line between too heavy and too smooth perfectly. The taste is consistently good, with a mellow spiciness. A lot of sweetness. Heartily enjoyed.","ReadingRambler","Aug 13, 2014"

It is certainly very drinkable, with the 9.3% abv well hidden so that after quaffing a few you won’t even notice when you’re dragged to your cell. Although the appearance isn’t great (fizzy disappearing head, no lacing), the aroma, flavor, and palate more than make up. I also like the appearance of both the bottled and best by dates – they are blue against the brown bottle and extremely legible, even with a sweating bottle.","Ozzylizard","Jul 06, 2014"

I am a fan of Weyerbacher and think Merry Monk's is the best of their year-round offerings. For the price (~$11.99, 6-Pack, $8.99 750ml bottle), the quality and attention to style, this is simply one of the best craft brewed Belgian Triples in America. Although I prefer the mouthfeel of Merry Monk's from a 750ml corked & caged bottle, the 12oz format is just as good (and a better value). Being that the brewery boasts an active barrel aging program (Blasphemy, Insanity, Heresy and now Rhumpshaka), I would absolutely love for them to experiment with a Merry Monks aged in whiskey barrels.

As I let it warm just a bit, the banana really came through too strong for me, not changing the rating but still, worth noting it really uses the fruity flavor to mask the abv. It really is complex, if you're on the fence after seeing reviews, I say go for it, you won't regret it even if you don't love it.","wildcat2015","May 05, 2014"

There's a few elements that count definitely be improved upon, namely the slightly imbalanced sweetness in the flavor. I would have liked to see more earthiness shine through to kind of cut down the fruitiness. The coriander and clove spice just didn't do the job fully. Other than that, this is an enjoyable brew that is great for late night, slow-sipping.

Medium body approaching full with a nice slick texture. Very well carbonated from bottle conditioning. More flavorful than most Belgian tripels, although this one is US made, with a nice tartness against a typical Belgian flavor profile with a touch of spice. Finishes nicely with a slight alcohol burn at the back top of the throat. One of the better tripels I've had.","tillmac62","Dec 13, 2013"

However, I found the alcohol flavor and dryness of this beer to be overwhelming. I did not get the sweet finish and, instead, found the alcohol really coming through with every sip. The faint fruit and spice flavors did little to mask it.","scanny24","Nov 18, 2013"

I found myself forcing it down quicker because it definitely started to develop a stronger rotten taste as the beer's temperature rose higher.

Had this one years ago, dont know how it evaded my review list or what my initial impression was to compare to. The flavor wasn't bad, just when i think tripel i think lighter golden body, snappy carbonation, more spiciness, head formation, and sharp drinking experience. As well a little unfiltered floaties are also a welcome gesture. To give you an idea of my preference St. bernardus, watou, and unibroue's la fin du monde all make for fantastic examples. Again not a bad beer, just a bit off base per style to my liking and a bit heavy handed in the malt/body department.","beerthulhu","Aug 29, 2013"

3.73,-3.4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a hazy yellow with an orange tint. The color of blush on an apricot. A finger of foam that fell slowly to a thin skin on top. Good retention and lace. Nose is malt bread, caramel, banana and pear. Some apple, raisin and yeast to round it out. Bubblegum and clove, pepper and faint floral. Malt deepens with a little bread as it warms. Taste is banana, pear, a little acidic, pale malt and honey, a little pepper and spice on the back palate. Clove really comes to the palate as it warms. Body is light and mouthfeel is creamy but a little heavy. A touch of grass brings the hops to the palate in the finish as the alcohol leaves warmth and dryness to offset the juicy fruitiness. It’s a little tart and tangy but the bread is amazing and full which both contribute to it’s heaviness. I thought it was a good tripel. Not quite subtle but well done nonetheless. After all a tripel is for sipping not slurping.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to one finger extremely slowly. Maintained phenomenal pacing throughout the glass. The aroma wad comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, wheat, spice, banana runts, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, wheat, spice, alcohol, and subtle wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The nose on this one was very inviting and quite complex. It had a big sweetness and spiciness going on in it that I really enjoyed. The flavor however was quite hot with alcohol and honestly took me back. Really wish this had not been the case. I would drink this one again in the future but aged quite a bit to let the booze settle out some.","thagr81us","Jan 11, 2013"

3.92,1.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"very good belgian ale here, not totally conventional, but a clever incarnation of the tripel style. this beer pours cloudy and flat in color, somewhere between straw and wheat in terms oc complexion, and there is just an inch of thin white fizz on top. the nose is very fruity, like golden raisins, figs, and candy sugar. the yeast imparts a gentle spice character as well, which is more apparent in the flavor than the smell. it has a sweet flavor, like it should be sugary, but it isnt at all, and is in fact dry as it drinks. the alcohol is well hidden, and the fruity elements blend well with the lighter malt profile. this feels more like a summertime drink to me, but it was plenty sessionable in the middle of december, with its vibrant carbonation and clean finish. i thought the body was a tad too much for the style, it made the beer seem a little heavy, and its delicate essence was trampled on a little bit by its weight, but even with that criticism i thought this was a very enjoyable bottle of beer.","StonedTrippin","Dec 09, 2012"

Aroma is yeasty, the brew smells like cloves, bananas, bready malt, pears and some green grapes. It tastes like bready malt, yeast, cloves, candy sugar, pears, and bananas. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is very carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this easy to drink. I think it's an OK brew, but there really isn't anything about this that would make me want to buy it again. With that being said, I do think it's worth trying.","bluejacket74","Feb 04, 2012"

Tons of fruit, wheat, and light spices hang out but nothing like a tripel should be. Found these strange sour notes here and there and have NEVER found this in this style. If you see it, I would recommend if your looking for a fruit beer but don't go out of your way.","DCon","Jan 29, 2012"

Nose is apple, peach, pear, clove, other spices, and yeast. Very balanced, and nothing really sticks out. The taste is good, but not quite as balanced as the nose. It's almost really good, but not quite. This falls short of the best in style, but it's still top 4 or so American Tripels I've had. It improves as it warms, however... Massively. Feel is a little dry and carbonated for my taste on the style. It's probably the weak point for this brew. All in all, this is a good tripel, and I would have it again. Unfortunately, it's really easy to get world class Belgian tripels around Washington DC... so I don't know when I would pick this up. Definitely check it out if you haven't though- another solid brew from Weyerbacher.","jayhawk73","Oct 02, 2011"

And feels the part. Yeast formation... In palate is most definitely american with fruits that would symbolize harsh esters in other beers like banana... Not particularly spiced to comp that. Still broad but tight... as a triple should be. Belgian sugar cane esters. Light wheat silk feel. Palate doesn't insinuate banana as much. Crisp, mild wheat. Marzipan hints.

Also the deep snifter glass allowed me to agitate and swirl the beer a lot helping the aromas and flavors come out.

3.68,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Merry Monks is one of the best year round releases that Weyerbacher has I think. This beer on it's own can show what the brewery is capable of doing. The beer pours as a bright hazy yellow with a big billowy head on it. The head releases some fresh aromas of Belgian yeast, some citrus fruits, and even a little clove might be in there. The taste is refreshing, it's got some nice citrus bite that mellows out into an earthy brew as it warms up. This beer has a good mouthfeel too. It's on the lighter side but still has enough body to not really feel watered down.","Knapp85","Apr 14, 2011"

The smell reveals what's perhaps its most feature - real potent banana esters, but more like a greasy banana chip as opposed to fresh flesh or peel. And it's quite inviting and truly dominates the aromas and flavors, which both lack pronounced phenol or alcohol presence - meaning, all you have to cope with here is a tasty, moderately malty (in sweetness and body), mildly banana fruity Belgian-style ale.

Bubblegum sweet malts open each sip, followed by a brief blast of intense spiciness, before an overbearing alcoholic heat takes over to finish. As the beer wamrs the boozy quality fades to an acceptable level and yields to the yeast induced spiciness (though it never disappears). Mouthfeel is decent, but the carbonation is a touch on the high side. The harsh alcohol taste at lower serving temperatures slowed me down and left the majority of the beer to be enjoyed warmer (and better). Average it out, and drinkability is alright.

The finish is soft, clean and very dry. It has a very phenolic flavor. It's almost meaty. The fruity tones are not as prominent in the taste as they are in the aroma.

However, I imagine if you prefer your Tripels to be on the dry side then you may really enjoy Merry Monks.

Full-bodied with a fluffy feel, like a mouth full of cotton candy. Which is not far from how it tastes too. Banana, strawberry, peach, apricot, pear, red cherry, pineapple, a veritable fruit cocktail sloshing about. Luckily, there is a bitter kick at the end, almost shocks you awake. Orange, lemon citrus alternates between sweet and sour. Coriander, clove, nutmeg spice, but without much directed role.

The citrus and floral notes are still there, but they are toned down some. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately high carbonation, and a smooth texture.

This is one cloudy bastard, perhaps I was a little too rough on the pour because the particles making it appear cloudy are individually identifiable and some of them are rather dark and large floating around in suspension. Carb level is quite high, mouthfeel pleasantly medium and slightly syrupy in the finish as well as warming.

The head was yellowish-beige, three-fingers in size, retained excellently as a fluffy cap and turned rocky after a while. The lacing was also impressive in sliding sheets. The aroma was of citrusy hops, Belgian yeast, crystal malt, lightly spice and a touch of nuts. The flavors were complex and on-point for a Belgian style Abbey Ale. I tasted, Belgian yeast, toffee, light caramel, floral hops, spicy hops and citrusy hops, alcohol, sweetbreads, a touch of dough and coriander. Semi-sweet and a little tangy. The mouthfeel was creamy, frothy and slightly slick. The body was full and the carbonation lively.

The aroma was lightly citrusy and yeasty with citrus hops, red grapes, burnt malts, and a hint of yeast. There wasn't much going on in the aroma or the taste. The taste was lightly citrusy with a touch of citrus hops, more burnt malts, alcohol, a hint of lemon zest, subtle grapefruit, and a pinch of yeast at the end. Belgian taste? Not really. It was just a beer with little flavor. This was light bodied beer with a faint aftertaste of citrus hops, alcohol, citrus fruits, and a hint of yeast. Not much going on there either. I don't know what to say about this beer. Is it a Belgain style? If it is, then it's on the lower end of the Belgian styles. I sure hope not all of these are like this and I just got a bad bottle.

It poured a light, hazy gold and the sediment hung in the glass without settling to the bottom. Smelled of citrus, spice and hops but not overly strong. Had a nice body in the mouth and went down real smooth. The fruit, spice and hops were well balanced and a slight bitter aftertaste lingered after the swallow.

Light to medium-bodied, this beer has a some sharpness as it hits the tongue but rides out smooth. While no hop kick is really present, as it shouldn't, there is a wonderful fruit burst. The fruit I tasted most for some reason was cherries, but there were tropical fruits suchs as pineapple in there as well.

Appearance has never been all that important to me, which is good, because it's the color of wet straw with little head. Aromas of yeast and sugar leap from the glass. It has a long malty middle with a sweet Belgian-y backtaste, like a sweet version of Duvel. On the finish it segues from sweet to dry, a little champagne-like. It hides the alcohol pretty well (not necessarily a plus, since I like a little alcohol presence).

Typical of the American versions of the tripel. The candi sugar and alcohol heat dominate the palate, this brew could use a bigger malt presence to balance. The feel is moderate and a bit syrupy, finishes with alcohol heat on the back of the tongue.

Picked up some grassy aroma as well. The flavor was a classic tripel. Lots of yeasty flavors, plums, a touch of peach. A lot of bready grains mixed in as well. A touch of alcohol was definatly there and made its presence well known. Great smooth feel due to lots of carbonation. This was actually not as much of a sipper as I would have thought. I was easily able to drink this while walking around no problem. Not saying it would be a session beer, but not a snifter eaither. Overall I was actually fairly impressed with this.

Agitation yields pear fruits, white candi sugar and earthy, subdued hops. Very sweet (with some vanilla flavor) to start off with, along with a green apple fruitiness and fresh dough flavor. Hop bitterness is not nearly developed enough to balance things out. Mouthfeel is poor for the style: very sticky and sweet, with none of that Belgian dryness the style needs. I can't think of a single reason to choose this over a more authentic, actually Belgian tripel. It's way too sweet and thick for the style... and even if you wanna throw style out the window, it's just cloying and untasty.","geexploitation","Apr 27, 2007"

It is not so pronounced that I am sure that it is not just the yeast. Whatever, the tartness actually adds to the complexity and balance of this brew. That same earthy-spiciness that is in the aroma is here in the flavor, but it is actually balanced out quite a bit by the subtle sour notes. Flavors that pop into my head as I contemplate this brew; Notes of lemon, a bit of chalk, some green apple notes, perhaps a touch of celery root (that might be a stretch, but there is something here I am trying to describe), some star fruit, and even a touch of kiwi fruit. The finish has a hint of phenolic notes and hot higher alcohols character that almost serve the same function as hop bitterness. Both of these components are subtle enough to only add to the overall experience. This beer is quite drinkable, and surprisingly dry, I was expecting something much sweeter than this.","Gueuzedude","Sep 03, 2006"

Crisp pilsener and yeast in the aftertaste with a flash of alcohol and mild golding hop bitterness. Tame in every way except the fusel burn.

Other smells that come through are the high alcohol and a candy sweetness. The taste gives you a big blast of sweetness up front. Eventually some yeast spicyness comes through and it finishes with some alcohol burning notes. This is definately a sipper, which fits the style.

But the sweet fruityness saves the day; very nice and aromatic. Medium body here. If I had to make up a word to describe the flavor i would use "wood-berry". Because it tastes woody and has some berry flavor. There is even a hint of snapple tea! Nutty also. The flavors are kinda weird at first and I haven't had a tripel quite like this before but it is probably the most drinkable one I have had.

Hints of candy and sugar coated dried fruit seem to jump out as the beer warms. Despite the high ABV, this drink was very enjoyable and suprisingly smooth.

Alcohol warming is notable. The brew is not very malty, and neither is it yeastyId like to see a little more of these traits in the brew. Light in body for the style.

Expressive yeast on the nose reminds of raw pie crust. Good fruit esters range (melon, banana, mango). Floral and spicy(mint, jasmine) hops somehow manage to leave an impression despite all the other things happening while the aroma is not all that intense. Sweet initial taste, but theres a firm hoppiness developping in a perfumey and herbal way, almost grassy. I dont know why I dont like it more, but the hypothesis is just the huge competition level in this particular style where you need big demarcative aspects (mostly complexity, appearance and balance) to be at the top. This one gives me the impression of a balanced ale with well contained alcohol which makes for a very decent american take on the style despite lousy looks.

Gassy, with robot-fart metal belches replete with ripped, stripped sugars and hot grease nuances. Thin where it counts, hot where it shouldn't be, this is a careless, industrial "craft" beer.

It finishes dry with a short note of candyish malt that's quickly washed over with a slap of drying alcohol. A decent tripel that's quite varied and nice.","NeroFiddled","Oct 31, 2003"
4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I hereby commit the heresy of saying this is better than Allagash's Tripel Reserve. A very lovely beer priced at a bargain rate $2.50 a bottle. I think there'll be a little monastery in my cellar shortly. So long as they keep it down during Matins, I'll be happy.","ManekiNeko","Oct 09, 2003"
2.75,-28.8,4,4,2,3.5,2,"This is not a favorite of mine, and I totally dig the abbey beers. It had a nice look to it, with the rich creamy yellow color and the nice little head. The smell was very complex. It had elements of citrus, alcohol, and other things. The taste was similar, except for the overbearing taste of an old musty house with moth balls. I couldn;t finish it, due to the old person taste. It was very rich as well. Not one I'll have again. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.","JISurfer","Sep 28, 2003"
4.05,4.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Merry Monks seemed to be a typical delicious Belgian Tripel at first glance. Indeed, it is quite good, but after finishing the glass was not quite what I expected. An extremely appetizing beer, it pours a cloudy golden color with a dense white head that retains very well. Great aroma of spices and and lemon. Mouthfeel is rather spritzy and carbonated, as expected. At first this beer shows a nice blend of hops and citrus elements, with a touch of alcohol. It is rather well hidden considering the ABV of over 9%. However, I expected a big spicy kick near the end, which never came. Instead it finished dry with a candy-like sweetness. This wasn't a terrible thing, but not what I expected, and I would have preferred the warming alcohol/spice finish. That's the knock on drinkability. Still a very tasty beer that's worth checking out.","IrishRedRock","Sep 07, 2003"

4.07,5.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Appears as a drop of sunshine gold with a glowing orange haze to it in contrast to a white short lasting layer of foam. Aroma contains Belgian spices, sweet malt tones with maybe a touch of candied sugar, and quite a pleasant citrus tone to the nose. Flavor is sweet and full not lacking in any major areas just a great representation of the style especially to come out of Easton, PA. Taste contains and blends all flavors so nicely with spices, citrus tones, sweet fullness that stands up to most competition. Mouthfeel is a bit undercarbonated for the style but the nice syrup texture adds to the greatness of this brew, very nice texture. Drinkability besides the alcohol this one is a very good tripel not outstanding but very very good, bravo.","WVbeergeek","Aug 13, 2003"
3.8,-1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I will question scoring it as a triple. The others I have had, both on site and in tastings, have been far more attention getting. I really think this is more of a double. Triples, as all baseball fans know, are rare.","RonfromJersey","Jul 03, 2003"

3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a clear gold color that was decently carbonated. For this style I would have thought it would have been cloudy or some haze to it. It produced a foamy white head that sat on top of the glass. It lasted fairly well then dropped to a thin film on top of the liquid. It left behind a decent lace on the sides. The aromas that came from the glass were of fruit (apples, oranges), spices (cloves), bananas, sugar, hops, light malt and yeast, and alcohol. Spicy and fruit comes to mind on the nose. The tastes were fairly similar to the nose, flavors of sweet fruit (oranges), fresh picked hops, cloves, peppercorns, bananas, sugar, malts, some yeast, and alcohol (but not over powering). It left a slight alcohol and a dry spice taste on the tongue. Medium bodied. Fairly clean and decently complex in flavor. Not a bad example of the style, but it seemed to be missing something. But drinkable.","Jarod","Jun 16, 2003"
3.8,-1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This wasn't a terrible Tripel, but it wasn't quite the sweetness that I find I prefer in a quality tripel (such as Allagash). A nice effort, however, and I look forward to seeing if they can improve in the future.","beergeek279","Jun 12, 2003"
3.63,-6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Turbid light amber. Initially thick head settles into a thin, soapy layer that leaves spotty foam trails. Banana esters are prominent in aroma. Mellow bready, musty sweetness and mild green apple. Hint of solventy fusels with a deep inhalation. Very tame aromawise, but relatively clean. Honeyish sweetness upfront in flavor morphs into ripe, lingering banana sweetness. Faint, herbal clove and grassy hop emerges mid palate. Mild hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness mostly unhindered, but tapered enough to prevent it from becoming cloying. Becomes lightly cidery, and candi sugar driven late. Lowly carbonated for style. Sufficient dextrins for a pleasantly soft mouthfeel. Finishes mostly clean, with fleeting hints of clove studded sugar sprinkled bread. A very mellow, somewhat understated Belgian strong golden. A bit shy on yeast derived contrast to malt and/or sugar sweetness. Overly clean, but certainly soft on the palate and highly drinkable overall. Tasty, but not outstanding.","marc77","Jun 05, 2003"

3.85,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a clear, bright golden/copper color with a nice whitish head that sinks down to a thin film with a nice ringing lace. Sweet candy sugar, spicy pepper, orange zest, and other light fruits are present in the aroma. Hudely sweet malt and candy right off the get go on the taste. Peppery alcohol and general fruity flavors with a bit of orange. Slightly medicinal flavors linger on the tongue and are the only thing that detracts from this brews flavor. Extremely smooth with a nice zesty quality that seems to make it dance on my tongue. A very nice brew that I would gladly drink again.","Murph","May 15, 2003"
4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a golden color and formed smooth white head that left a solid layer of lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of hops, banana, citrus and spices. A flavor of hops, spices like coriander and caramel. It had a medium body finish and a touch astrigent. Not a bad belgian style.","Wildman","May 11, 2003"
3.85,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12oz bottle: A bit of a golden hue, with a little cloudiness. Some hints of bread, banana and clove in the nose. Tastes are very similar to the aroma. The taste is pretty much in line with other tripels. A good brew, but just a little lacking in comparison to other Belgian or domestic tripels. Allagash or Golden Monkey are much better. Duvel is still the king!","Boto","May 03, 2003"

4.09,6,3,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a pretty good beer. The nose and taste is fruity. There is a high alcohol content but that doesn't overpower the beer by any means. There is so much taste that you would never guess it comes in at 9.3%abv. The mouthfeel is kind of syrupy with only a little carbonation. There aren't many subtle changes as you move through the beer. The alcohol peeps its head in at the finish.","Maestro","Dec 18, 2002"
4.52,17.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Beautiful, rich, golden beer. Too bad there was no head. That would have made it an amazing sight. It smelled unexpectedly tart, elements of green apple, malt, and slightly cirtusy hops in the nose. This beer was mildly tart and a bit biscuity. The biscuit flavor increased substantially as the beer warmed. The malt was held in absolute perfect check by the restrained bitterness and acidity. At 9.3% ABV there was no foul alcohol taste, only it's warming presence. The viscosity was ideal for this beer, and the carbonation was from bottle contitioning and as a result it was light and perfect. Weyerbacher has a real treasure in this beer.","yen157","Nov 03, 2002"
4.07,5.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a murky orangeish-yellow color, portly and frothy white head, tonnes of lace. Nose is citrus, malts and a bit floral. Front is sweet, malty, the top is moderate in mouthfeel, the finish is, tart, pleasant hop presence, benignly acidic, with a droughty aftertaste. Just a downright good Triple, not a great , just quite drinkable.","Gusler","Oct 25, 2002"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Certainly a treat to try another brewery’s triple, remarkably complex perhaps too complex if that is possible. It seems like most of the flavours are fighting for dominance and no one prevails. If this one was to be laid down for several more months it would have been a bit more melded. A great brew but a little too fresh.","Jason","Sep 12, 2001"
