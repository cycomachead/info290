The smell was hoppy and citrusy but not overwhelming in either area. This was an easy drinking hop in the back of the tongue beer. I loved the alcohol content while being so easy to drink.

In fact, there was a ton of sediment that I didn't care for at all. Looked like rocks in the bottom of my glass! Once I dove in it was a game changer. Great smokey, banana, clove nose despite the lack of head. "Once it hits your lips, it's so good!" Ready for whatever was to come, I was pleased. Slightly warming with the all the Belgian yeasty goodness. A beautifully crafted beer.","LloydDobler","Beers"

3.9,6.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/6/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, orange, golden raisin, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast ester and bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of apricot, orange, golden raisin, pear, apple, light banana, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, golden raisin, pear, apple, light banana, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice tripel style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 12, 2014"

The nose comprises clove, light maple syrup, lemon zest, orange zest, black pepper, light banana, and a touch of toasted caramel in the back. The taste holds notes of heavy clove, black pepper, light banana, toasted caramel, honey, mandarin orange syrup, and a pinch of nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly syrupy feel. Overall, an interesting and solid brew.

While not as pronounced as usual for this style, I am definitely picking up some pear and green apple notes. This is a very mild rendition of a triple, but the flavors work well together and I am very much enjoying drinking this. Medium body with a nice soft mouthfeel that could maybe use a bit more carbonation for style, but is pleasant none the less.

Blasts of sugar and booze, tropical fruit including mango and pineapple. For sure there's a bit of nutty yeast like notes and mild spices. Flavor brings out more tropical fruit content with excellent spicing balance, a bit of alcohol in the finish enough to make it a rough experience slightly fusel. The yeast dough/nut combo is almost like one of those Italian nougat desserts. Not much in the way of an evident hop profile here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly cloying with residual sugars this one has a ton of malt in it, carbonation is better than most of their other offerings still not world class but acceptable.

The spice and malt takeover and dominate the flavor. A little warmth is sensed in the finish. This Tripel is missing the vinous and fruit qualities I love in them.

No sting or harshness from the spices which I often find to be the case, but there is a bit of an odd lingering cinnamon/nutmeg on the back of the throat. This is very easy drinking, not bigger than medium bodied but there is a slight sense of creaminess.

Plenty of tropical fruit flavors, certainly sweet, notes of licorice, pineapple, pear and light citrus. Some bready malts make their way to the front mid-sip and turns somewhat dry and yeasty on the finish. Not sure what the ABV is, but it's well-hidden as there is not much of a warming effect. Full bodied, almost creamy, not a lot of carbonation going on. Drinkability is on the lower side, as I usually prefer Tripels as a sipper.

Nose consists of candy sugar, light fruit and a trace of the alcohol character is revealed, but not at all boozy. Flavors consistent with nose. Perhaps a hint of peach, as well as a subtle spicy character. Mouthfeel is medium bodied in consistency, gravitating slightly towards syrupy, but not unpleasantly so. Also a light effervescence present across the palate and tongue. Alcohol is well-hidden, but packs a punch. I'm two-thirds through and really starting to feel it.

3.85,5.2,4,4,4,2.5,4,"Pours out a cloudy dark honey color with big white creamy head. Big, drippy lacing. Smells are hefe-like phenols, alcohol, honey, and a very faint spice. This is a very light and fresh tasting beer. Honey, berry, fig, sugar, peppery spice , grassy flavor and tart alcohol come out more or less in that order. Mouthfeel is mid-bodied with very active but really teeny-tiny carbonation bubbles that give it an over-all fuzziness. May come off a little flimsy compared to its begian couterparts but for the price difference it is well worth considering.","JudgeRoughneck","May 21, 2006"

Taste is not super strong. some sourness. lots of alcohol evident. i actually like it because most tripels are too spicey/strong for my taste.

2.96,-19.1,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"The medium-body is smooth and enjoyable, but what detracts from the beer's drinakbility is its sweetness. A noble, though slightly flawed effort at a difficult style from Dark Horse. This is certainly worth trying if you happen to come across it, but probably not worth adding to a list of must-trys.","benito","Oct 25, 2005"

3.96,8.2,4,3,4.5,4,4,"A good place to start when getting into Tripels, Dark Horse has got this one down. Poured out to a slightly hazy rich yellow golden color wiht an nice 1/2 inch head. No lace noted. Medium carbonation. Aromas could have been stronger, but hints of zesty yeast and weak hops were noted. The taste was complex and very well balanced. Flavors of buttery biscuts, malt, yeast and some citrus notes meshed very well. Finished crisp and a bit dry. Quite sweet all around. Good drinkability, this would go well with many meals, or just fine on its own. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Aug 13, 2005"

4.12,12.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep gold/light copper with w quite persistent 1/2 inch white head. Aroma is a mixture of tropical fruits, coriander, and pepper, quite a lovely smelling brew. Flavor doesn't have quite the depth that the aroma would suggest, beginning slightly sweet, then finishing with some light fruit and spice notes. As it warmed a bit, the flavor began to take a little more shape. Has a medium body with medium carbonation... quite smooth actually. Overall this is a pretty good Tripel... pretty much right on for the style.","zerk","Jul 13, 2005"
4.2,14.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The taste and feel of this beer run together to deliver a smooth and delicious treat. Well drinkable density in body. The spice factor is just perfect here. No over"beering" attributes to the flavour. In my estimation this is right up there with the Chambly stock. Delightful and soothing. Brilliant sweetness that never becomes a burden. The flavours dance across the palate, creating a crisp brunt and a welcome afterglow of sweetness. The spice character that so often over-emphasizes the Belgian style is tuned to precision here. I love it when a beer I hypothesize to be be "not my cup of tea" turns out to be an absolute pleasure to consume. Fine craftsmanship Darkhorse!","SupaCelt","Jul 07, 2005"

Malty with a lingering sweetness. The spiciness is great here. Cloves and coriander. Mouthfeel is very appropriate-not overly syrupy or sweet as some US examples are. A definate asset to the US triples out there. This has to be the best US interpretation I have had so far. Well worth seeking out. Thanks again to eyedrinkale.

4.03,10.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a frothy white head. Extreme effervescence is noted. Aroma of bananas, yeast, and alcohol. High carbonation is prickly on the tongue. Bitter lemons balance with sweet bananas and candy sugar. Lots of clove and other spices come in fighting. Spicy hops and alcohol cap off the flavor. The brisk carbonation breaks up what would otherwise be quite a thick mouthfeel. Good American take on the tripel.","BeerFink","Apr 23, 2005"

Cross a hefe with with a strong english ale and you get this. First sip gives the appearance of a hefe but it immedately fades into the fruityness that tripples are known for. Nice hop presence also, not sipcy at all just a nice presence. Due to it's complexity it lowers the drinkability, that is to say you can't drink a bunch of them.

Aroma is sweet, wheaty, lightly fruity, and alcohol presence is apparent. Taste is everything the nose portends it to be, which is great. Seems more generic bitterness than hops character.

Pours a cloudy, honey and mango color with a nice lace rim. Smells . . . like fresh spring air. There's no real character but freshness, perhaps after a rain. Nicely carbonated, fizzy and spunky that you don't taste actual flavors until swallowing. At first, I thought I perceived an orange honey, yeast, and tangelo flavor. But as I began to write the review, I swiped a drink without concentrating and epiphany! This tastes like a malolactic, not over-oaked California style chardonnay with a yeast and malt twist. The very final note of flavor is in the aftertaste: bitter, but understated.","marcellaproust","Beers"
