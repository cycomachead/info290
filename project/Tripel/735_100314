Clean undertones of the pumpkin and spice make it work, instead of being big and overwhelming. A well done beer with a unique twist.","jera1350","Feb 16, 2015"

3.77,-0.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Not a whole lot of quality canned Belgian styles, so this is a treat. A hazy and heady bright blonde beer, it definitely looks the part. Sweet candy sugar and wheat malt nose is really intensely Belgian, with pear and apple and winter spice notes from the yeast, big no doubt too, with a little booze showing through. Floral at first sip, yeast meets hops, and I immediately the hop dosage here, more than other examples of the style and it's a success. Yeasty too, heavy from it despite ample carbonation, and more sweetness than I care for usually, but that's more a commentary on the style, not necessarily this specific beer. Fruity and spicy both, this yeast is gnarly. Grainy texture is cool, but one is enough. I like what these guys are doing for canned beer, cool to have this as an option, although I prefer their IPA.","StonedTrippin","Oct 30, 2014"

3.25,-14.2,,,,,,"Deep golden yellow color in the body I expect a bit of haze in a tripel, this one has some herbal vegetal pumpkin earthiness off the bat.  Fine creamy head with nice patterns of lace.  Aroma has a bubblegum note,, with honey coated biscuit malt, and spice with pumpmkin flesh.  Flavor  a bit too sweet and cloying for me.  Spices although subtle just don't mesh well with this 8.2% abv Belgian style tripel, comes off cloying after the first few sips.  I can feel the alcohol in this one, way more well hidden booze notes in the dark baltic porter, the tripel seems a bit fusel.  Mouthfeel doesn't burn with alcohol but the warmth hits me, carbonation is not effervescent enough spices linger and don't belong in this style but each sip stays on the palate.  Overall, I want a straight up tripel but pumpkins and spice sell in this season!","WVbeergeek","Oct 09, 2014"

A nice pumpkin and spice flavor lightly meshed with a stone fruitiness. Juicy sweet and has a taste of honey.  The malt is a treat and it's supple.

Aromas of subtle pumpkin sweet, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, apricot, clove, and bubblegum. Rich, sweet, and spiced, all together in a balancing blend. Flavors are pumpkin sweet and cinnamon and nutmeg spiced on the forward tongue, with a more heavily spiced character on the tail end, more typical of the Belgian styles, with some fruity sweet notes, as well. Coriander and clove join the pumpkin spices, leading to a moderately spiced, tangy sweet aftertaste. Mid-bodied and very crisp, with a linger of spices in the tangy sweet finish. Solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 17, 2013"

I was excited to see that Elysian was involved in this. This pumpkin tripel is not bad at all, but perhaps a tad on the sweet side. Nicely spiced with fall spices, and with a touch of pumpkin creaminess.

Flavor is pumpkin; nearly pumpkin pie filling in character with Belgian yeast and a combination of pie spicing (clove, cinnamon, light nutmeg) and classic tripel cardamom; nicely balanced. Medium bodied with light creaminess, satisfying. A well melded pumpkin ale that retains tripel character while presenting the pumpkin pie character nicely. Spicing is deftly handled. I either really love or hate pumpkin beers and it really hinges on authentic pumpkin flavor and a light, but distinct use of holiday spicing. This one scores on both fronts.

3.83,1.1,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"D - Definitely much more of a Tripel than a Pumpkin Ale... The pumpkin notes are uber subtle... If I didn't now they were present, I would have a hard time actually detecting them... With all that being said it's a solid and enjoyable beer, but not quite what I was expecting... Not sure I would rank this high in terms of either Tripels or Pumpkin Ales, but for those seeking out unique offerings this one may fit the bill...","philbe311","Oct 19, 2013"

It's pretty competitive with Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale for my favorite pumpkin beer, though since they're different styles it's difficult to compare. Anyway, you should totally check this beer out if you get the chance.","Erbayd","Oct 17, 2013"
4.32,14,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O- Very complex and interesting beer. The pumpkin pie and Belgian tripel notes actually blend together quite well and complement each other. Lots of sweetness but it is cut by the alcohol and bitterness so it is just right.","Hoptometrist","Oct 17, 2013"
