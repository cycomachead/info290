4.42,7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 11/12/2014. Pours slightly cloudy deep golden color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale/bready malt flavors; with an awesome crisp malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible spiced tripel style. All around outstanding balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. An insanely delicious offering.","superspak","Jan 19, 2015"

Scents of bubblegum and lemon with a strong malt backbone come out heavily in the head. The taste has notes of bubblegum as well. Strong malt and a very good spice package that is hard to identify but notes are similar to cardamom. There is also a perceived sweetness in the beer although I doubt the level of residual sugar is actually very high. Exceptional yeast notes as well.

All in all, It's a good baseline representation of the Tripel style. It tastes great but is otherwise not unique. If that's your jam, you will like this one. But if sweet, spicy Belgian ales are not your thing, this one won't convince you otherwise. There are beers I'd buy over this one, but I'd never turn this one down if offered. I definitely recommend giving it a try.","DannyS","Apr 23, 2014"

Thick 750 ML corked Belgian bottle poured into Omegang glass that came with the 3-pack (what a deal!). Its a slightly hazy orange-hued golden ale with faily high carbonation and thus a substantial and long-lasting head. Typical Belgian aroma that conceals the spices really well. Very nice honey and spice, and very well balanced. The spice is muted in the taste until the beer begins to warm up, then the spice becomes apparent but never overwhelms. Excellent mouthfeel. Overall a super enjoyable tripel.","FFreak","Apr 14, 2014"

With a smell, I get the notes of white pepper, pear, apricot, vague cream, which altogether is a delicate and pleasing nose. The taste doesn't let down either, proving to be somewhat spicy with grass, orange, apricot skins, while overall delicate in taste. It pairs well with the airy, bubbly mouthfeel, and gives me the impression that this was brewed in Belgium, not mid-state New York. Tripel Perfection may be a stretch as a name, even though this is outstanding....perhaps Tripel Outstanding instead?","DoubleJ","Jan 04, 2014"
4.36,5.6,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Pours out a little muddy amber in color (as In not quite clear) with a huge 3 finger, white head with decent retention and a bit of lacing. Smell is that typical Belgian yeast with bananas and cloves. A nice little sweet smell from the malt really makes the nose nice. Taste is everything in the nose and a little TINY bit boozy but this may be a little warm (not 40F - probably 50F). Really has a nice crisp flavor and feel as swallowed. Mouthfeel is really pretty thick which I like for the style due to all the carbonation. Overall another really nice beer from Ommegang. Most of them of wonderful.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 03, 2014"

A bit thin and not too sweet with a touch of dryness and a bit of tartness from the fruit. The grain is light in the body of the beer as it warms and adds a supple quality to the drink. There is a touch of alcohol that enhances the fruit sweetness. The aftertaste is long and dry and this has a mild spice and pepper finish that is simply wonderful.","utopiajane","Jan 02, 2014"

Almost no alcohol presence, nice and rich with good spicing.  I would rank this Tripel with the very best I have tried.","JayQue","May 09, 2012"

4.12,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. It is an opaque orange beer, with a white foam head made of small bubbles. I can make out plenty of rising carbonation at the edges of the glass. The aroma is very nice, with plenty of candi sugar, musty Belgian yeast and a little bit of dried apricot. I wrote that the flavor is interesting. Candi and crystal sugar sweetness are present. The finish is peppery. It tastes a little dry and powdery. It isn't as clean tasting as some other triples. It is full bodied and possesses slightly above average levels of carbonation. It foams up a bit as I swallow. It leaves behind a good coat that helps maintain the peppery flavor. It is pretty drinkable, but has more pepper than I excepted. One big draft pour is enough for me, although I could finish a 750ml bottle if that was what I had. It is an enjoyable beer, but I don't think I would seek it out.","ToasterChef","0"

The beer is medium bodied but the alcohol is well hidden by the smooth carbonation. This is an absolutely amazing Tripel, dare I say one of the best brewed in American and likely the only one alongside Pisgah Solstice that I would put up against the best ones brewed in Belgium.","atsprings","Jun 23, 2010"

3.91,-5.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Thanks go out to jonesy77 for tipping me off to this guy's presence in the District! It pours a hazy sunshine straw with a finger of white bubbly head. The nose comprises wheat, some grass, bready yeast, clove, and a faintish banana, much lighter than I would have initially figured. The taste brings this apparently mostly theoretical banana element into true focus, joined by cloves, pepper, cardamom, and that always fun and super-vague term, "spice". Since I've never encountered All-Spice in the real world (beer world is nicer, but heavy on the escapism...kinda like taco land...), I can't use it here, but I still kinda wanna replace "spice" with "all-spice". Maybe not. Regardless, the body is on the lighter side of medium, with a lightly active carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

4.2,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pretty ballsy of Ommegang to throw the word perfection in to this new release. The look of the beer starts things off on a good note; hazed golden in color, with just a bit more than a lacing for head. Tropical fruit in the nose, yeast must in places, and a dry medicinal presence. More of the same from the taste, coming off in a very bright, more pronounced way, if that makes sense. Lively mouthfeel, with plenty of carbonation to assist in drinkability. The ABV is hidden well, but can be felt after the first few sips. Alright, so this might not be an absolutely perfect Tripel, but it comes pretty close as far as I am concerned. Definitely one of the best I have had in recent memory. You also have to give Ommegang some credit, as it sounds like they have been working on this brew for some time. I guess their determination has paid off, as this is an awesome Tripel, and beer overall. Cheers","jamie2dope","Jun 11, 2010"
