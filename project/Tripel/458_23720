It's definitely a Tripel, though not as rich and full as some of my other favorites, especially among the Belgians. Good enough, however, that I buy it when I can, and look forward to it year round. Great color and taste, but not quite as much head as I might like. Love to drink it on tap sometime: only had it from the bottle so far.","BirFan","Dec 05, 2014"

4.75,23.4,,,,,,"These words are true; this beer has a high ass ABV, with deceptively smooth flavor that can lead to severe drunkenness (comparable ABV beers such as Dogfish Head 90 Minute or New Belgium Rampant tend to remind me exactly how potent they are with their flavor intensity and thickness, while this brew goes down easy like a light beer but hits just as hard), and unique, smoky, crisp overtones that have serious nostalgic value for a guy who was raised in and has lived in Texas his whole life. Sipping this I am reminded of outdoor fire pits and the sensation of warmth in the winter. I seriously recommend this beer for anyone who has the opportunity to try it. It might be a little more expensive than some of the other Real Ale brews or a larger pack of lower quality beer, but trust me, it's worth it. If I could get paid to tattoo this beer's label across my back I would. Enjoyd","jcance","Oct 25, 2014"

Real Ale makes fantastic brews (Fireman's 4 is another staple), and even though they are a very high quality house, we can get alot of their great stuff in just about any convenience store/gas station in the Hill Country. As a huge aficianado of Belgian Ales (especially Trippels - best in the world, IMHO), I had tried many so called craft "Belgian Trippels" before with usually great disappointment, but I was blown away by this one when Real Ale introduced it in 2010 - they got it right, and they have kept on doing that!","mblk6062","Aug 04, 2014"

4.06,5.5,4.5,3.5,4.25,4.5,4,"Being a huge fan of Belgian Ales, from this golden style to a deep, dark divinity like Chimay Grande Reserve, this one is right up my alley. The hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste is not strong like an IPA, somwhere around 35 IBUs? Poured from a bottle into a 16oz, short bell-shaped glass with handle. Color is a beautiful goldenrod, and smell is fruity, like subdued bananas and sweet malts. Feeling on the tongue and palate is thicker than wheat beer, but nowhere near amber or dark Belgian ale. Head dissipates very quickly in such a wide-mouth glass, and barely lasts 3min in a thin, fluted glass. No matter, because if you like a little bitter with your golden cream, then this is a beer for your roster. I give it a 4/5 because it lacks a little in complexity, though there are spices noted throughout the tasting experience. I will definitely buy again, as it delivers a simple Tripel experience without the Belgian Tripel price. A very Americanized version of a classic, this one is good for advocates to become acquainted with the heavier Belgian styles. Excellent for a sweet tooth, and quite refreshing!","BSDA","Jun 09, 2013"

Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. fluffy, white head doesn't recede much, and billowing amounts of carbonation flow off the bottom of this crystal clear burnt orange colored beer after I get it in the glass. Really nice looking. Smell- honey, burnt caramel, candied sugar, spices on the end. Nice. Taste- hmm. I got a mouth full of spices- maybe nutmeg, cinnamon in there. Some sweetness behind it, but what I didn't get that I was really expecting was that honey/burnt caramel flavor that I got on the aroma. This actually has a fair amount of bitterness on it, and doesn't have that big backbone that you would expect to get from a tripel. Regardless, this is a solid brew, one that I would have again. One of the great things about the #rootrootdrink challenge is being forced to try new beers, and this is a nice outcome- finding a local beer that you've passed over before that is really pretty good.","lnashsig","Jun 13, 2012"

As a Tripel, this beer leaves a whole lot to be desired from the hops to the attenuation, but as a open-ended Quad, the beer is pretty decent. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer again, but I am not going to have a problem deciding between the St. Bernardus Tripel or this one...I will just drink this one because it is a decent high-gravity beer by one of Texas's bigger Micros.","SkeeterHawk","Dec 08, 2010"

A floral bouquet fills the nose with hints of candied sugar, pumpkin pepper spice, and lemon. This opens up with a lively and spicy big tart taste that makes way to a juicy, huge, delicious, full-flavored, malty center and burnt sugar follow through. By the sip, this slowly goes from being an aggressive brew on the palate to a smooth and complex treat that I particularly enjoyed with Prosciutto de Parma.","albertjr21","Aug 03, 2010"

3.8,-1.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Devil's Backbone, eh? Sounds sinister. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose banana, clove, pepper, rye bread, lemon zest, and a touch of citrus hops. The taste is similar, though with a heavier tilt toward those hops. As such, the citrus-y bitterness, not unlike an orange rind, is quite pronounced, driving the yeast-y and spicy notes underground, popping up only when able (or when crime is afoot...Turtle Power!). The body is fairly light, with an active carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a solid tripel, a bit heavy on the bitters for me, but not enough to ruin things. Worth a try for sure.","TMoney2591","Jul 24, 2010"
4.26,10.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An excellent Triple. I have always enjoyed this on tap when the season came. I am so happy this is now bottled. I think it is even better out of the bottle (which is the only reason I am doing a second review). Probably the best American version I have had of the style. Again, well done Real Ale.","champ103","Jul 08, 2010"
4.52,17.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a mouthful of of just a different combos of spices and sort of a hint of banana cream. At first sip it is great then after a 3rd or even 5th sip you sense the alcohol taste and somewhat of a sting to your cheeks and gums. Its a drink you know the alcohol is there, but still is a great drink to chill with the friends not something I can handle all night and just chug.","beergambit","Jul 07, 2010"
3.83,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Westmalle Chalice hazy Golden Yellow with a thin white head, decent lacing. The scent isn't too strong, but the belgian yeast is very noticable. The taste has the rather smooth Saaz hop bitterness and that candy sugar mixed in with that strong belgian yeast giving a citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and leaves a sting to your cheeks. Might be something that could mellow out with age.","whoneeds8","Jul 05, 2010"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"D: I really like this tripel. It may not be the best representation of the style, but Texas doesn't have too many Belgian's...this beer surprised me as it is actually good!","Kromes","Jul 03, 2010"
3.35,-13,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"D - I've heard this described as a hybrid between an Tripel and a Hefeweizen, and I'm inclined to agree; the fruity, banana flavors that I typically associate with Hefes are present here. It's a solid beer, but Hefes are one of my least favorite beers, so that knocks it down a bit.","NefariousR","Jun 23, 2010"

3.85,0,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazy golden in color with a thin but active white head that leaves lacing right off the bat. Smells of peaches, lemons, and pepper. Taste is sharp and citrusy up front, then has a dusty malty carob-y thing that takes over. It finishes dry and sharp, with just enough of that dusty finish to make you want more. The aftertaste is a touch metallic and bitter, not at all what you get from the rest of the taste profile. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and slippery, it stands up & fights back. Drinkability is good, though limited by the aftertaste. Very good, but not great. That being said, one I would buy again and I'm very excited to see some local breweries branching out beyond the standard IPA/brown/blonde/pale ale offering.","roblowther","May 01, 2010"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a clear medium yellow color with a white head, which quickly disappears. The aroma is very fruity with lemons, oranges, pears and mangoes with alcohol, coriander and candi-sugar. The flavor is lemon, peach, oranges and pears with yeast, candi-sugar and spices. The spices are pepper and coriander. Medium mouthfeel and a medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Apr 21, 2010"

4.25,10.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The 2010 Backbone is great. The aroma is clean and fruity (pears, grapes, honey). It's a gorgeous translucent (almost opaque) amber in appearance, like clover honey. The head dissipates fairly quickly, with a bit of lace clinging to the glass and around the edges of the beer. It's very drinkable, even in a month or two when it's going to be warm here in Austin...dry, spicy, fruity finish. Yum, guys!","Jillwastaken","Jul 01, 2009"
4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: A very strong effort out of Blanco, TX. I am always leary of Tripels that are outside of the Trappist traditions, but this is great. I will concede a local bias, though.","DeathbySexyBT","Jun 16, 2009"
3.8,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Taste is a pungent and tasty mix of fruit flavors, candy sugar, and a touch of hops. Hop and alcohol notes are detectable, but almost entirely concealed by the standard tripel flavor. The finish is just a touch bitter, however, which wasn't expected. Mouthfeel is probably the standout area, as Devil's Backbone has a rich and creamy body that is more substantial than I've ever tasted in a tripel. The strength of flavor and ABV limit drinkability a touch, but this is definitely an enjoyable beer!","Riccymon","Jun 09, 2009"
3.75,-2.6,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The flavor starts well enough with some doughy pale malts and cracker crust. A quick kiss of spices, light fruits, and floral hops drop out of the middle. Could stand to be a bit sweeter, especially in the finish, where the bitterness gets acerbic and slightly harsh with booze. Body is on the chewy side of medium, with a nice carbonation level, but the aftertaste causes the mouthfeel to be taken down a notch...drinkability, too. Still, a well-crafted American tripel, and one that would probably cellar well if it were bottled.","wagenvolks","Jun 03, 2009"
4.52,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Silky smooth and creamy sweet malts! Lightly caramel with loads of alcohol and a nice crisp bittering finish. The mouthfeel on this beer is exceptional.

Very good tripel, put this in a bottle please!","twiggamortis420","May 27, 2009"

3.26,-15.3,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours a light amber with a thick head that reduces to fingers then a rim. Smells more of hops than it tastes, with a hint of sweetness. Tastes rich and sharp with lots of amber malt in there. Some complex tastes are hiding in the back, and it has a great aftertaste, combined with sharpness from the alcohol up front. Feels thinner than I'd expect from a tripel, with some cut from the alcohol. Overall fairly better than average.","jordanmills","Mar 15, 2009"
3.63,-5.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I sampled this at the brewery. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but tasted smooth and like I expect a tripel to taste.

3.91,1.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It was a hazy orange-copper beneath a full head of off-white froth. The head held well, and it left beautiful creamy walls of lace in its wake. The nose was honeyish and spicy with a bit of alcohol and some phenols that left it perfumey. The mouthfeel was bristling with tiny-bubbled effervescence, and it was medium in body. The flavor followed the lead of the aroma, but added in an orange/citrus side that was unexpeceted. The rye was clear, and it's peppery edge cut through nicely. The bitterness was moderate, as it should have been, with the spiciness of the rye and alcohol keeping it dry. It finished honeyish and dry, with lingering notes of black pepper and phenolics. It's a sipper for sure, and a pint of it during a party was not the way to really enjoy this beer. I'd much rather have had it in a quiet setting as a sipping beer. Still, I enjoyed it nonetheless, but I went back for a pale ale instead. Interesting and enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 25, 2005"
