This viscous brew coats the palate with a wide spectrum of flavors as others here have described.  The brewers at Flying Fish have definitely created a dynamic beer that is outside of the box and is a great brew to  drink slowly and enjoy.","LancasterSteve","Dec 12, 2014"

I am never without less than a 6-pack (and more like a case) at any given time. The ability to harness the profile of a Belgian Trippel/Tripel/Triple and combine it with the hop aroma/flavor from Pacific Northwest hops makes it one outstanding offering. Exit 4 is one (among many) reason to rejoice being born and raised in New Jersey...get it if you can! What's more, you cannot beat the value for a Trippel of this caliber (~$10.99 a 6-Pack)...simply amazing! 4.75","threeviews","Jan 15, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, pineapple, tangerine, peach, pear, clove, pepper, light banana, floral, light honey, light pine, bread, candi sugar, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, pineapple, peach, pear, clove, banana, pepper, floral, bread, light honey, candi sugar, light bubblegum, and floral/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, clove, pepper, bread, light banana, light honey, candi sugar, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice dry hopped Tripel style. All around nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 30, 2013"

Finishes with a nice combination of sweet biscuit malt, yeast, tangy grapefruit and citrus flavors, some spiced fruity notes ending has some zesty mild hops bitterness for balance.

Poured a hazy red-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, and subtle alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really did enjoy this brew quite a bit which was surprising to me. Based on the trade number I got this one from Lunch, I have had this one AWHILE. Seemed to have held up quite well though if I'm honest. Might hold onto the others for awhile longer to see what becomes of them at a later date. A definite must try if you have the opportunity.","thagr81us","Aug 18, 2011"

Palate is slick and sweet right off the bat. Malted grains flavor dominates and is joined with orange blossom honey. I would think an American Triple would be more "unique" than this. Too sweet for me, and I really like sweet triples. This is too loose on the mouthfeel; no structure at all. Not impressed, unfortunately.","SFLpunk","Jul 20, 2011"

4.42,16,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: I was expecting a good take on a trippel and found a surprising sense of a Belgium IPA. At least for me, despite the sweetness and spiciness, or precisely because of them, there is a rich hopped sense that competes with the best takes on the emerging BIPA style, maybe the bigger alcohol profile makes it stay in the Trippel camp? Regardless, this is probably the best Flying Fish I've tried so far.","Daniellobo","Jul 07, 2011"

It is very dark (darker than most Tripels I have had that are brewed with Belgium candied sugar). The aroma and the flavor is not as complex as other Tripels, and the beer is not as heavy as it should be (I am not saying it needs to be syrup, but it should have some larger body).","ianjsullivan","Jun 26, 2011"

For a bottled conditioned Belgian, there was no sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Nice nose, but a bit light for a Tripel. I get some orange, clove, faint wheat and breadiness. Somewhat sweet. Some of your typical tripel characteristics are missing. I get a hint of clove, orange, banana and some wheat. Maybe even some pear? Actually some hop bite to the finish.

The flavors and well-balanced mouthfeel hide the power of this quite well and if this was randomly given to me in a glass, I'd have a hard time discerning where it was from. Like a good Victory or Ommegang beer, this can hold its own with the beers from overseas and has me wondering what the other offerings in the Exit series taste like. I can't recommended this enough for those who love a well-crafted belgian beer and this was good enough to make me want to try others down the road. Yes, it's that's good!","JerzDevl2000","Mar 23, 2011"
3.05,-19.9,3.5,3.5,3,2,3,"O: Overall not a bad beer, but I'd almost call it a Belgian IPA rather than a tripel--the bottle even advertises its relative hoppiness compared to other tripels. I might rate it slightly higher as a BIPA, but as a tripel it is too sweet, thick, and lacking the light fruit flavors that make a good tripel.","n2185","Mar 15, 2011"
3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O - This feels like a well made and well developed tripel. It's not as aggressive as some of the other American made tripels I've had, which is a nice change of pace.

3.7,-2.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The tangerine colored body was glowing, and the restrained carbonation formed a head just shy of one finger thick. The aroma was definitely more American than Belgian, with a grapefruit hop smell that was close to that of a DIPA. The taste also revealed an abundance of hops masking the qualities that should exemplify a Tripel. There was a lot of citric hop presence, and almost no Belgian yeast influence. Don't get me wrong, as a DIPA, this would be well above average fair. I was just expecting something else entirely. There was decent heft to the body, and a lingering aftertaste as a result of the stickiness. Easy to drink despite the near double digit ABV. I wish they had saved some of these hops for other beers, and let me taste this for real. Either that, or a different name would do as well.","rajendra82","Mar 10, 2011"

3.32,-12.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured a medium hazy amber/orange with a small white frothy head that was mostly diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was moderately heavy of resin hops, a mild straw malts and a doughy yeast with a hint of citrus and alcohol. It tasted mildly sweet and slightly malty at first and then became slightly bitter-sweet with a hint of yeast and alcohol at the finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and dry in texture with a very soft carbonation. Overall a nice tasty tripel with a complexity of flavor.","KajII","Feb 22, 2011"
3.19,-16.3,3.5,2,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a hazy tangerine. Exit 4's got a nearly four finger tall white foam cap. that fades just a little too quickly for retention to be considered "good". Likewise, there spots of lacing left all over the glass, but I'm looking for full rings and sheets of it. The nose is disappointingly weak, with alcohol by far the most prominent presence. Citrusy hops, pale malt sweetness, and a hint of clove are all present, but just barely. The flavor is a vast improvement, if still somewhat pedestrian for the style. A sweetness leads off, very heavy on pears, and blends quite nicely with the tropical fruity american hop notes. The problem is that where I'd like to see a big clove yeast presence and a slight warming from the alcohol, I instead find an unpalatable booziness and a hint of yeast phenols. Still, the other half of the flavor profile is good, so the beer's not a total lost cause. The body is impressively and appropriately light for a relatively large beer, but the carbonation is far from Belgianeque. It's a bit flabby and inexpressive. Exit 4 isn't a terrible beer, and I think the idea of marrying a tripel and American hops has promise, but the execution falls short when compared to top class versions of the style","axeman9182","Feb 20, 2011"

Head retention is decent and there is thin lacing down the sides of the glass. Nose is intense. Grapefruit and orange zest with a little bit of banana and clove. Smells more like a serious American IPA, but the Belgian influence is there. Palate is very much like the nose and is not typical of the style. Grapefruit hops, banana and clove, and a bit of fusel alcohol. There is a nice subtle bitterness in the finish. A unique and delicious tripel with an obvious American twist.","JunkYardJake","Feb 15, 2011"

Started with a dense, foamy white head, but with little retention as it reduced very quickly leaving a few wet lacings. Sweet malt and fruity aromas, grapefruit and ripe orange, with the expected Belgian yeast and sugar smells. A bit of a funky odor in there as well along with a faint hint of alcohol. On the watery side of medium bodied with light carbonation. Hoppy orange and pink grapefruit flavors in the beginning that lead to a sweet malty and bubblegum middle and a lightly bitter finish. A hint of coriander peeks through near the finish but is overcome by the bitter hops and light alcohol burn. Wonderfully complex and fairly easy to drink considering the higher ABV.","IronLover","Feb 06, 2011"

I have never heard of Flying Fish Brewery until now since they are a small brewery out of New Jersey that doesn't get much hype here on beer advocate. This is also an American Tripel which happens to be my first as well. It pours a golden color with lacing that quickly retreats down the side of the glass and what doesn't retreat, dissipates. The smell draws you with notes of fruit and spice. The first time I smelled it my nose burned. Taking a sip I get apples, grapes and that spice that makes it feel like I am drinking a holiday beer. The fruit and spice lingers after you take a sip. After each sip I feel like I am drinking a white wine with all the fruit notes I keep getting.","BigB415","Jan 30, 2011"

It pours a clear straw yellow with a typical white head - not inspiring, but as the old saw goes, never judge a book by its cover. Flavor, fortunately more than makes up for the so-so appearance: strong, hoppy, malty, with sweet apple and floral undertones, just a little bitterness, and a whisper of honey.

Smells of nice citrusy hops with a zing of pine tossed in and a sweet malt and estery base, with further fruit smells developing. Fairly dry in the nose. Nicely balanced in the mouth. Honeyed malt, nice Belgian yeasty notes with some banana and spice as well as some plum, some wax, and quite a nice citrusy hop presence with nice red grapefruit and orange flavors. I'm really enjoying this. There is a nice lingering bitterness. Not super sweet, which I like, and the hops help balance everything. The citrus flavors are great, and the alcohol is very well hidden.

Flavor is similar to aroma, although a low sweet grain flavor supports the intense hops. Bitterness is low, as expected for a Trippel. Very interesting blend of citrus, tropical fruit, and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is medium body and moderate carbonation. I'd expect more fizz in this style. Low alcohol warmth.

The flavor seems to be a bit sloppy. Alcohol just dominates the palate. If that was not bad enough, this beer is also very dry and has a bitter finish. Hard to pick out any of the Belgian qualities. Sort of tastes like cheap, high ABV wine. I think I am being generous giving this a 2.5 in taste. The body is on par for the style and is nicely carbonated. Bottle conditioning worked its magic here.

The taste holds notes of all of that, plus some citrus peel, coriander, more pepper and cloves, and what seems like a decent amount of hoppy bitterness.

3.83,0.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability - No way can I compare this with a St. Bernardus tripel, tripel Karmeliet or a Westmalle tripel. In my opinion, this doesn't fit the "Tripel" class. No BJCP guidelines for this offering. To me, you add an arse load of hops to a tripel style and you get this beer. The beer's overall ease of consumption is there, as the alcohol is well-hidden throughout. Good density in this beer and would stand up to many foods that are exceedingly robust (pot roast, thick soups/stews, etc.).","Nesued","Sep 08, 2009"

The head is off white, appropriatly huge initially, decent retention showed then spotted lace left behind. Fruity candy sugar sweet nose. Got to respect em for swinging for the fences with a take on this outstanding style, but this one does not make it out of the middle of the road. Some phenolic tendencies, but not enough, some hoppy feel but not enough. All in all a decent tasting brew, but ends up being a lower level American tripel, compared to the all stars of the style.","Billolick","Aug 27, 2009"

You could definitely pick up hints of the alcohol content in the aroma, but fortunately you also pick up a pungent herbal spice aroma, most notably cloves. Also picked up some lemon zest, orange, and bubble gum. The taste was medium-bodied, medium carbonated, with strong citrus and herbs throughout, and a stronger than expected alcoholic feel in the finish. Despite the slight burn, the citrus/spice bouquet and medium feel make this a decent session beer, at least before the abv knocks you out. Well done, FF.","donniecuffs","Aug 10, 2009"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"In terms of this being an "American Tripel," I would say that this is even more of a hybrid than the label advertises. It's definitely an American-Belgian in that the brewers used a Belgian yeast strain and hopped the wort more heavily than a continental brewer would have. But there's a slight sourness to the beer here that I don't normally come to expect with tripels. The sweetness is downplayed (though you can taste golden malts and honey), so what you end up getting--in my opinion--is an Americanized saison. Further supporting this argument is that the beer is not as heavily carbonated as I expect tripels to be. I'm not getting the champagney mouthfeel that I've come to expect from Belgian tripels. In terms of the beer's "aim," I would definitely say that this is a more refreshing bee than it is a sipper. Alcohol presence is low, which is nice, as the fruitier qualities and the dryness are permitted to take the reigns. This beer reminds me quite a bit of the 2008 Stone Vertical Epic. Despite my semantic nit-picking, I really enjoyed it.","TheNapkin","Jun 26, 2009"

I have the distinct feeling that there is complexity here that will emerge more clearly with a bit more bottle age.
