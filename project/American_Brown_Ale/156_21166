The finish may seem a bit astringent, but I personally don't mind this as the front and center are bold and fruity with plenty of nuttiness and semi-sweet roastiness. Interesting and potent, give this one a try.","blackcompg","Nov 21, 2014"

This stuff pours a clear russet-garnet topped by a half-finger of ashen khaki foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, sweet coffee (imagine sniffing the air at the mall right at the edge of the food court where there's a coffee "store" and a candy store right next to each other), mild cashew, and a hint of cocoa. The taste holds notes of fusel alcohol (up front and in-my-face), burnt nuts, toasted malts, and bitter coffee. Things took a turn from the pleasant and sweet to the unexpectedly crass and bitter. Shame, really. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, what could have been a solid beer (judging by the smell) instead allowed itself to succumb to the Dark Side, with a flavor combination that made me harshly grimace with every sip.","TMoney2591","Feb 20, 2013"

A bit more roast than expected but nit overly dry or acrid with hints of coffee and toast. This is cut by the maple sweetness as well as some subtle spice, caramel, toffee and hazelnut. Decently balanced and the high ABV is well masked, but there's an odd lingering aftertaste that hurts drinkability. Not bad but I don't think I would go for this one again.","corby112","Oct 11, 2012"

I slipped this in to my tumbler, so nothing on the head and I don't care either; and looks dark like a stale cola, or neglected coffee, or warm prune juice, or an oil change. Smells like this will be a malt bomb too, as it should be. Taste is malty, and dry, and slightly bitter, with ripe fruit and prune and late cherries: but I'm not detecting the maple. Seems a wasted carbohydrate to add to the vat...it all turned to booze. And I know what I'm talking about, having had my maple trees tapped, and I'm semi-addicted to the stuff: There doesn't seem to be any maple here, but I'd be walloped too if there were any, thinking that beer might be the surest way to kill the subtle flavor in maple. And nuts...don't detect them either. For nine percent booze, doesn't seems that alcohol forward. Malty not being my thing, and bitter more than anything is what I'm after, I can say this was a serviceable beer only, and not really the beer for me--meaning the style more than the brewery.","Bitter_Echo","Sep 19, 2012"

4.14,11.3,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall / Drinkability: I think the normal version of this beer is the superior one. It's far more flavorful and aromatic, and to boot, it's a lot more sessionable. This one is good, and is a great slow sipper with the malt bomb it is, but it doesn't wow me like it's less boozy cousin. So drinkability is one and done. Don't get me wrong though, flavor is great and right up my alley, but somehow the overall package (especially the appearance) was underwhelming compared to the other. Still, worth a try and glad I got it - I just will probably reach for normal strength when offered.","damndirtyape","Aug 13, 2012"

3.58,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 9/17/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a good 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some pretty good lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, molasses, maple syrup, roasted nut, toast, toffee, raisin, and light herbal; some alcohol appears as it warms. Some pretty nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, biscuit, raisin, roasted nut, earth, herbal, and light maple syrup. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, toast, and nuttiness on the finish for a short bit. Flavors are pretty good, but they aren’t as robust or balanced as I was hoping; hardly any maple flavor in the taste. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Feels a bit thin for a 9% beer, but it is good enough. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good imperial brown ale. Some nice flavors with decent balance; and quite smooth to drink for the alcohol level.","superspak","Jul 01, 2012"

3.96,6.5,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good American Brown Ale. This beer can definitely hang with the other higher alcohol Brown ales like Palo Santo Marron. This beer was much better then their Maple Nut Brown Ale, the imperial version did a great job at making all the flavors from the original more robust and tastier, the maple syrup actually stuck out in this beer as opposed to not being able to find it in the base beer. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, I liked how the maple syrup flavor showed up and all the other flavors made for a pretty complex beer. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad, it was just very sweet and not nearly as complex as the flavor. This beer had awesome drinkability, there was a little alcohol warmth, but it was pretty low and not that noticeable, I could probably drink two of these in a sitting, which is pretty good for a beer over 9%. I will for sure be going back to the store to buy some more, for $1.79 this beer is a steal, with the combination of smoothness, flavor, and price, this may be my go to Imperial Brown Ale. I highly recommend this beer, if you are starting to get bored with all the average American Brown Ales, give this one a try. I wasn't all that impressed with the original beer, so I really didn't know what to expect with the imperial version but I was pleasantly surprised with how well it turned out. So far this has been my favorite beer from Tommyknocker and I would say it's right up there with Palo Santo Marron as my favorite Imperial Brown Ale. Good job Tommyknocker, you guys really surprised me with this one, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Oct 20, 2011"

First the ABV isn't well hidden at all, I get plenty of alcohol taste on the finish (more than anything else), this isn't quite the malt bomb I expected (although it has plenty of malts), I get some maple and caramel, perhaps a little toffee, its good except for the very dominating alcohol after flavor lessens its appeal, its still good but I thought it was going to be so much better from the pour and feel.

Taste was quite similar to smell, although the maple wasn't too overpowering as i feared it might be. Just enough to make a tasty presence. It finished with a nice alcohol warmth, which i think also helped preventing this brew from seeming too overly sweet.

The flavor shows a good amount of malty sweetness with caramel, brown sugar, hints of chocolate, honey, and a nice dry nuttiness. There's a bit of hop bitterness on the finish, just enough to provide some balance without stepping on the toes of the sweetness. The alcohol is present but not overpowering and shows through as a nice warming sensation. There's a lively carbonation that lifts the sugars off the palate and doesn't allow the beer to be too cloying.

Smells are faint but I detect resinous hops, lots of alcohol, and extremely sweet-smelling toasted malts. Fascinating on many levels - where to begin? First, the full body is quite active with crackingly carbonation. The flavors bop and weave and are hard to pinpoint. There are definitely sweet, dark fruity toasty malts are well supported on the palate by sprucey hops, but the finish is quite sweet and drawn out. A lingering element of stale coffee grounds detracts a bit from the taste. It's very interesting how the sweetness and bitterness interact; I don't think that "balance" was a quality sought by its brewers and so I won't knock this beer for not having it. Makes me think of burnt cherry cobbler. Very interesting; very punchy, hard-hitting. I definitely like this beer but have to limit myself to one.","droomyster","Jan 27, 2009"

Perhaps hidden by the alcohol or by the overly sweet flavors,I'm not complaining,but,it's just not nutty in the least. A dark,toasted malty backbone is enhanced by brown sugar and semi-dried figs. Alcohol is no after thought,it's pretty upfront and bold,it grows every second this warms.

Also some milk chocolate creamy malt layers are present with minimal pine notes with some oak aging like tones. Flavor has some overtly sweet cloying moments, like the whole maple syrup addition to a brown ale in the first place. After sweetness dissipates a tobacco leaf pine layer of hops moves in with dark chocolate bitterness and some alcohol presence. I'm also getting some of that soy sauce salty quality in there as well Mouthfeel is a bit thin compared to what I was expecting the syrup additions doesn't add any cloying properties and the beer is actually medium bodied with some soft carbonation. Easy to drink but as whole I'm no sold, this brew just doesn't do it for me too many competing flavors without cohesion.

There is a strong maltyness of the tongue that is apparent, but for the most part the taste goes down like a monolithic-block of well-fermented dark malts with traditional Belgian yeast. There is also a slight hint of the alcohol in the taste of this beer, but it's no different than any other over-8% beer that you'll find on the market.

I never order them as I generally find them to be simple, sweet and boring. Not so this beer, This beer had some real backbone to it (no doubt from the 9.8% abv.), with great intesity of flavor. While still on the sweet side, there were enough hops to keep the beer from tasting too cloying. This was actually a pretty fun beer to drink, and was really quite drinkable despite the 9.8.

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Imperial Nut Brown? Who ever heard of such a thing? Obviously I didn't know what to expect, but what I got at least looked like a nut brown ale. It poured with a deep chestnut body and raised a short but creamy ivory cap. The retention was a bit limited, but I chalked that up to the 9.8% abv. The nose was cocoaish and very lightly hoppy with a bit of mint, grass, and leaves. Some alcohol was present, but not obtrusive, and the maple syrup mentioned on the label made an appearance every now and then. The mouthfeel was medium-full, following in the "Imperial" designation, and creamy smooth. The first sip set off a light-bulb in my brain, "Oh", I thought, "an Imperial Nut Brown Ale is kind of like a barleywine"... and that was kind of true, but not really. Subsequent sips proved it to be much less malt or hoppy, and generally less caramelish. So an Imperial Nut Brown, after having taken a very, very long way round in explaining it, is exactly what it says it is... It's just a big brown ale. Nicely malty, cocoaish, subtly toasty, sublimely chocolatey, mildly bitter, gently hopped with grassy and lightly floral English hops, somewhat alcoholic, and in this case, drizzled with maple syrup flavor. And on that note, it finishes a slight touch syrupy (well, at least not dry), with some lingering sticky malt and maple character. As you progress through the glass some alcohol starts to build. I found it interesting at first, but by the end of the glass it had lost it's charm without enough depth to hold my attention.","NeroFiddled","Mar 05, 2007"

Emits rich, pleasant aromas of toffee, maple syrup, molasses, hazel nuts, raisins, cocoa powder and brown sugar. Full, chewy round palate with a fine, subtle carbonation. Flavor much like the aroma, but not as rich and hefty as one would expect from the nose. Pleasing notes of dark fruit, cocoa, toffee, roasted malts and molasses with a faint hop and alcohol presence to tame the sweetness. Unfortunately, seems to have a slight weird mid-palate watery thiness that detracts from the enjoyment. Overall very reminiscent of an English-style Barleywine to me.

The mouthfeel was medium, bordering on creamy. It had a great sweetness on the tongue and the finish really lingered with the maple syrup aftertaste.

3.75,0.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"22 oz., best within 4 months of 11/21/05 notched on the label. It pours a deep, almost blood red that is hard to see through and it's topped with a small khaki head. It has a big aroma of chocolate and vinous malts, with additions of toasted malt and grassy/perfumy hops. The flavor is pretty much the same with a good dose of hops that contribute a mild to medium bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to thick, and tingly at the beginning, but soon becomes full and coating. Probably the best I've tried by the brewery, and it seems like how an imperial brown ale might taste. I actually just today found another imperial brown ale (by Legend), so I'll have something to compare it against.","mmmbeer","Apr 13, 2006"

The flavor starts out with some brown sugar and molasses sweetness, along with some nuttiness (hazelnut and walnut), some light fruits (cherry and strawberry), tobacco, chocolate, toasted bread, floral hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit light (even for just a plain brown ale), with light carbonation and drinkability is good for the abv.

The maple syrup that was mentioned on the bottle did make it in the smell, but only faintly. This is a very tasty brown ale. The taste is dominated by sweet malts. There is some nice nutty, and syrupy taste to balance it out. My favorite part is the warm alcohol finish. The alcohol is not overpowering as Tommyknocker hides it well, but there is just enough to give it a very nice finish. The mouthfeel is good as well as the drinkability.

Head fades, but some still hangs around, with lacing present and accounted for. Aroma is dark fruits, alcohol, with some grains lying underneath. Taste is upfront with heavy sweetness, the maple syrup, I assume, then kicking in with the kind of tart dark fruits and alcohol, and that's about it. And grains seem to have lost the shouting match here. Mouthfeel is just "too" everything for me, and drinkability is reasonably limited due to the loudness of it all. I keep trying, but I'm thinking I certainly don't get these Imperial Browns. They seem to lose everything I like in a brown this way.","ppoitras","Nov 02, 2005"

Taste is similar to the Maple Nut Brown, heavy on the Maple, light on the Nut, but this time also heavy on the alcohol, which warms to the point of a hearburn-like effect. Whooo, this stuff catches up to you, especially in bomber proportions. Mouthfeel is bubbly and not as thin as other Tommyknocker brews tend to be.

Little in the way of alcohol flavor, but warm throughout. Hop detection in the bittering, flavor, and dryness. Fermented sour notes added to complexity without detracting.

The head lasted several minutes and produced some good lacing on the glass. First taste revealed a heavier alcohol content, but not overpowering. Not much carbonation and tasted malty, somewhat chocolaty with a rather flat finish. As the beer warmed, the beer seemed to become even milder and smoother.

Chocolate, maple syrup, caramel and some vanilla along with a nutty flavor are present. Tons of alcohol is there as well. Quite unbalanced, somewhat warming though so it'd probably be better on a winter's day. Its not a horrible beer, but not as interesting as I expected.

But that's not the case. It's sweet, but not cloying. The maple is noticeable as is chocolate. Alcohol lets itself be heard as well. There's a little heat to this one. Nuttiness and lightly kilned malts meld nicely together. It's good. Not great. In this particular beer, I could do without the jacke up EtOH level. But that's just my preference.

Notes of marshmallow, tobacco leaf, stewed fruit, and cola are detectable. Bitterness comes late, basically right at the finish.
