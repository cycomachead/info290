I found the color to be lighter than others, more of a chocolate brown with a lighter head than I would have expected. The taste was a mix of spices, rye bread, mad slight toffee notes. The flavor was actually fairly mild, which was surprising given the alcohol content. Pretty good, I guess I was expecting something a bit more robust.","MarkQ617","Dec 23, 2014"

The nose comprises dry caramel, fig, dark bread, musty grapes, light treacle, and a vague mix of spices.  The taste mostly brings in more of the same, though the treacle is now bitterer, and there's a bit more stonefruit notes.  Not sure where any of these came from, given the style, but whatever, I guess.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, an interesting beer, to say the least.  Rather than a hoppy brown (I ain't callin' it an "India Brown" anything, daggummit!), I got something akin to a brown spiked with a healthy Belgian yeast and some spices.  Weird.  Not too bad, though...","TMoney2591","Dec 17, 2014"

3.98,3.1,,,,,,"On tap at the Lark in East Northport, NY; pours very dark brown color with 2 finger foamy tan head that faded slowly and left really good foamy lacing and rings as it went down. Smells of molasses, brown sugar, piney hops, grapefruit, caramel, cocoa powder, roasted grains and coffee beans. Nice mix of malt and hops with good balance and roasted notes coming through the sweetness of the malt and hop aroma combo. Tastes like it smells, with molasses, toffee, brown sugar, piney hops, grapefruit, orange peel, citrus hops, caramel, cocoa powder, roasted grains, coffee bean, leafy spices like tea leaf and pepper. Very tasty, smooth and easy to drink, this was a lot more hoppy than most brown ales yet still maintained the nice malty base and rich sweetness that makes for a solid brown ale.

The flavor is an intriguing mix of caramel, roasted nutty brown ale flavors with bright citrusy hops and bitterness.

The head atop was however nicely proportioned at two finger thick, and the overall look grew on me in a short while.  The smell was a mix of chocolate, toffee, hops, and almonds, and was very inviting.  As anticipated, the taste was closely derived  from the smell, and I could get a complex medley of chocolate, some coffee, burnt toast, toffee, cherry, and then was hit with a load of hops mid palette.  It was more like an imperial porter than any kind of IPA derived brew, but whatever you call the style, it had a delicious flavor.  The body was surprisingly hefty for the ABV and the style, and the mouthfeel was  somewhere between silky and chewy.  The beer was different from what I expected, and better.","rajendra82","Aug 23, 2014"

3.9,1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/13/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, chocolate, toffee, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus hops and moderate dark/toasted malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, chocolate, toffee, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, chocolate, toffee, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of juicy citrus hops and dark/toasted malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly creamy, and fairly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial brown IPA. All around good complexity and balance of juicy citrus hops and dark/toasted malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

3.91,1.3,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a one finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark malt with light toastiness, nuts, hints of chocolate, light citrus hops. Flavor starts with the same lightly toasted dark malt, nuts, a bit earthy and develops a strong lupelin flavor with light piney and citrus elements, finishing with strong hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess in the finish. A nice earthy, toasted malt body, but it is overwhelmed by the bitterness of the hops, which seem to be all about alpha acids; very bitter, but with light herbal or fruit flavor elements. Perhaps a brown ale malt body is not sufficient for intense hopping, although some CDAs pull it off well. I did like this intense imperial brown ale, but there were moments when the hop bitterness was a bit aggressive. Interesting and a bit challenging. As I got used to the hopping, this grew on me quite a bit and I looked forward to the hop / malt interactions.","LiquidAmber","Jul 11, 2014"
