Anyway, this stuff pours a surprisingly swampy sienna topped by a finger of lightly-sandy off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted wheat bread, honey, oats, a sprinkle of dirt, and a vague notion of even vaguer fruits wafting in the breeze somehow, as though they were spirits of their former, earthly selves. The taste brings in more of the same, that odd fruit sensation remaining, but even more ephemeral, like the memory of the above description. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a decent little brown ale, nothing to write home about, and, unfortunately, with things like Moose Drool and Sam Smith out there, probably nothing I'm likely to see again (though I wouldn't shun it if handed to me somewhere).","TMoney2591","Apr 11, 2014"

3.75,1.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a solid translucent brown with subtle amber hues, with a nice two finger head and light retention. Nutty malt aroma accompanied by a fair amount of hops. Citrus and grapefruit in faint amounts with that typical and characteristic ale asylum aroma (hard to explain exactly what that is other than a gingery hop smell). Sweet caramel up front, cocoa, nutty malts, grapefruit, and white grape in the faintest amount. Slight tartness to it, medium body, the finish is a bit off, but still very drinkable and still very good.","manitouman84","Sep 08, 2011"

It looks like its on nitro, which it is not.","Sammy","Aug 26, 2011"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a stubby brown bottle with some kind of date code that is smeared off of the bottle. A good looking beer for sure. Clear chestnut brown with a few floaties that lead me to think this one could be a tad past it's prime and a massive khaki head that settles slowly to soft peaks. Roasted almonds and barley in the aroma..nice. Roasty and malty flavors with pecan-like nuttiness and plenty of rich malt that is well balanced with mild floral hoppiness. Medium lean bodied and creamy with smooth carbonation. A tasty brew.","biggred1","Aug 17, 2011"

It's great to see some brewerys outside of New Glarus make a good name for themselves in Wisconsin.

Nice beer to have sitting around in the winter.","delmarnate","Feb 17, 2009"
4.07,10,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a cloudy honey/amber with a nice tan head that leaves some lacing. Smells just like the name, a nice malty scent with some nuttiness and some hops in the background. First taste reveals a wonderfully light but flavorful malt with some roasted almonds and a very mild banana flavor in the background, followed by a milder hop note and a fairly clean finish. Very easy to drink and somewhat lighter-bodied, this brew is surprisingly refreshing and very much fits Ale Asylums solid full-malt style.
