Pours to a nice light root beer color with a tan head that recedes to a quarter inch then holds.  On the taste this brew is slightly roasted caramelly flavor with a tad bit of bitters in the background.  Mouthfeel is ok but not outstanding.  It kind of has a funky twang in the aftertaste that is niether sweet or bitter. This brew is drinkable and inoffensive but a long way from what I expect in a brown ale.  Sad to say for BMC the apple never falls far from the tree as they can't seem to go out on a ledge and need to try to please a general population.   Expected more just based on Blue Moon's Belgian White that is a good drinker for a BMC.","mooseisloose","Jan 06, 2015"

Lively carbonation continues to stream to the surface in tiny jets. Not much in the nose. A little caramel malt, faint cherry and a macro-lager scent. The flavor is a mixed bag. There's a touch of brown sugar sweetness and a tame hop profile. Even with generous gulp sloshing around my mouth, there's not much to hold on to in the flavor department. Ever-so-hidden touch of brown ale nuttiness. That's about it. Behind it all, there's a slight roughness to the alcohol content. Marginally solvent-like. The carbonation is very prickly and it masks the thinness of the beer a little. Well, Mom, I don't see myself picking this one up ever again. It should work just fine for poker swill tonight, but that's the extent of my plans for this beer.","JohnnyI","Jan 03, 2015"

This settled into just over two fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. "Copper" was exactly the word for the color on this one (SRM = > 17, < 22)! The clarity was button-bright and I was getting excited to try it. Nose had a light caramel quality, which was disappointing, since I expected more. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was definitely caramel, but still kind of muted, given their verbiage on the label. Likewise, I agreed with their calling the finish "toffee". In fact, I would say that the overall flavor was more toffee than caramel anyway. Call the finish semi-sweet as it was not outright sweet and just about as much as this hophead can tolerate. Once again, tis would be much more apropriate during the colder months, but c'est la guerre!","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2014"

The aroma is of caramel malts and a hint of spice. The taste is about the same with the semi-sweet caramel malts coming through at first with a perfect balance of a hint of wheat and brown sugar as well. Perfect carbonation and no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Another great seasonal from the Blue Moon folks.","BeerWithMike","Feb 23, 2014"

3.91,19.2,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"Blue Moon's Mountain Abbey Ale (formerly Winter Abbey Ale) is surprisingly not as good as I remember it. I had this beer two years ago when it went by Winter, but now that they changed it call it Mountain, I'm left a tiny bit disappointed. The appearance is good - very strong and dark caramel color. The smell is truly superb - you can sense the hints of toffee and roasted malts. You can even taste them, distantly. But there's way to much carbonation, taking away from what would otherwise be a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, it's good but nothing as good as I remembered it a while ago.","jjamadorphd","Dec 11, 2013"

Taste follows this recipe. Light biscuit, caramel and a hint if nuttiness. Light body. In its entirety the light body and rather nondescript flavor give this a watery quality.
