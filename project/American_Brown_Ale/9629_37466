Tastes of sweet, dark fruit (plum, cherry), a boozy bite, dark bread, yeast, biscuit, and roasted pecans on the back end.

3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/23/2015. Pours hazy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, maple, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and adjunct notes; with solid strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, maple, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, maple, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and adjunct flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a light-moderate warming that lingers after the finish; but never really feels boozy. Overall this is a very nice imperial brown ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and adjunct flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. Definitely could use some aging time to smooth out the warming alcohol, but still a very enjoyable offering right now.","superspak","Feb 28, 2015"

4.15,8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall I thought that this was an above average beer and a pretty good American Brown Ale that was quite unique for it's style and it fit the winter months nicely. This beer had pretty good drinkability, I could go for another one, but after that I think the sweetness and alcohol percentage would start to get to me, but it went down pretty smooth with not too much alcohol showing up for 9.5% beer. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both just about as good as it gets, I could smell this beer all day, that's how good the aroma was. What I liked least about this beer was how the body felt a little thin and watery and how the taste wasn't as robust and complex as the aroma. I will for sure buy this again if it is released next year, I am glad I went back and got a six pack. This beer is worth giving a try if your are a fan of nutty brown ales, this one stands out instead of blending into the crowd. I enjoyed this beer, I like the complexity that the maple syrup and pecans added, it was just enough to make for a good flavor and great aroma without feeling overdone. Short's really did a good job on this beer it seems like they have a special gift for knowing exactly what added ingredients work best with what styles to make for a truly unique and memorable beer, and to me that's what Short's does best, they make memorable beers and this one is no exception, great job guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 31, 2012"

I've had a lot of maple syrup beers that frankly should have left the maple syrup out of their name. Short's typically can nail the flavors they boast in their beer.

This is a sour beer on first sip, but I can taste the malty bread flavor, roasted nuts, and slight maple syrup. The infection issue is awful when combined with these flavors.

Pours a dark cola brown with hints of amber around the edges and a small off-white head that doesn't linger long and leaves only a swirl along the top with no lacing. The maple syrup is abundantly evident in the aroma, which is very sweet overall, with caramel and toffee coming through as well. There are hints of both the nuts and some booze which stings the nose slightly. I think I would describe the taste as a slightly more abrasive version of the nose. It's got the maple syrup which sticks to the palate along with the alcohol which makes its presence felt in the finish especially. The overall character is slightly toasty with the pecans showing up in the background. The mouthfeel is, no surprisingly, syrupy, and get almost cloying with the big maple syrup presence. The body is pretty heavy because of that and the carbonation is pretty light. This is not one of my favorites in the imperial series and the sweetness is enough to limit the drinkability.

4.5,17.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"To my mind, this beer seems outstanding in many respects, from its bold and synergistic flavors, lovely aroma and color, to its high ABV- this beer has a lot to offer. I imagine this would be a nice drink to share with those who may have yet to develop a palate for craft brews, as this showcases quite nicely flavors that most folks may already know and appreciate. And on cold winter nights, sitting around a nice fire with friends or a loved one, this would be a winner, for certain, IMO. Maybe even as compliment to pancakes, bacon, and eggs for breakfast, for those "vacation" days ;) I also find the whimsical artwork on the bottle brings yet another dimension of enjoyment to the beverage. In Short's, a brilliant beer :)","B0bD0bbselbock","Jan 19, 2011"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This might not be as drinkable as a standard brown ale, but it is much more drinkable than many other beers of its size and malt character. When I smelled this and got all that malt in my nose, I figured it would be a sipper, but the nuttiness on the end helps it go down faster. This is a very well made beer.","zoso1967","Jan 18, 2011"
4.42,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I like that I can taste everything that was put into this ale, and would be pleased if it worked its way into a regular winter bottling rotation.","Another6Pack","Jan 16, 2011"
4.23,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and tastes great. It has a good balance to it, as a deep flavor profile. This is a great beer from a great brewery, and I'm glad I got the chance to enjoy it. I can't wait until my next trip the Shorts brewpub.","JizackFH","Jan 02, 2011"
3.38,-12,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Reviewed on 6/29/2010. On tap at Shorts. Pours a dark amber brown with barely any head. Aroma of sweet nutty malt. Flavor of maple (but not so much maple sugar), nutty pecan, also a strange saltiness (mushrooms?). Not overly sugary or malty as I was expecting. Still, it didn't quite sit right with me. An interesting beer to try, but I'd suggest a small sample!","LilBeerDoctor","Dec 23, 2010"
4.37,13.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Another dangerously drinkable beer from Short's. A hefty beer which will really sneak up on you. A couple pints would probably be my limit, but I would enjoy the hell out of those pints. Excellent beer and a privilege to drink.","kzoobrew","Aug 28, 2010"
3.8,-1,4,4,3.75,4,3.5,"Growler picked up at the pub. Dark brown with tan lacing. Smell is sweet and nutty. Taste is very sweet maple syrup up front fading into roasted pecans. The mix of the two makes you think of a great pancake breakfast. For 9.5% ABV this has excellent drinkabilty. Interesting and worth trying.","webmanspidey","Aug 15, 2010"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"How is a beer of 9.5% ABV so damn drinkable? It's scary in a way as this is a sipper, so make sure you have a friend or two to share the bottle with ... or not. The maple syrup does add a good amount of depth, as well as the pecans even though they stay a little vague. Vite Estreme Della Birra!","BeerAdvocate","Jul 06, 2010"
3.65,-4.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Semi-hazy dark amber with a small off-white head that recedes to a thin collar. Toasted pecans leap out of the glass, slightly overwhelming the toasted malt foundation. Maple syrup is noticeable on a lesser level, lending only a touch of sweetness. Toasted pecans and maple follow through on the palate, though it's not especially sweet. Flavors of toast and roasted malt are stronger mid-palate along with moderate bitterness. This is enjoyable, but I find myself wishing it were less attenuated to balance the slightly chalky and astringent character of the nuts. The finish is dry and lightly bitter with a lingering nutty aftertaste. Pretty good, a different yeast, something with more of an English ale character, would have made this more enjoyable.","largadeer","Mar 01, 2010"
3.53,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is sweet and has a liquor like quality to it, a rather strong liquor like quality, bourbon almost. I guess the point of this beer is to taste like bourbon, congratulations, you did it, you really did. Drinkability is fine, mouthfeel is fine. I guess its an OK beer but not a repeat for me.","drabmuh","Jan 30, 2010"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Quite sweet but probably the most maple I've had in a beer. The nuts are quite subdued at this point as well and a mild tartness seems to be developing.","brewandbbq","Jan 20, 2010"

3.96,3.1,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,"The smell comes very close to meeting expectations. A very nice toasted pecan scent matches well with the maple syrup used. Both of which carry over well into the taste and are met with a light sweet chocolate flavor. Unfortunately, some of the bitterness of a pour or aged brown ale is showing in the aftertaste. All in all, another great offering from Short's. Well done men!","CoolJosh","Nov 29, 2009"

3.41,-11.2,2.5,4,3.5,3,3,"D and overall impression: Drinkability falls a little short on this as well. A little too sweet for me. Overall, I think this had a little too much age on it. All of the flavors had mellowed, and I don't beleive this is what Joe intended this beer to taste like. Would have really liked to try it fresh and compare. But, I am reviewing this bottle, so i am not impressed. Skal.","Gtreid","Aug 06, 2009"
3.95,2.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours brown in color, a little translucency around the edges. Smell is some light dark malts, and just a hint of alcohol. Taste is roasted malts, there's a good amount of alcohol in the taste. Very smooth and easy drinking. This is a good beer. There's even more alcohol showing up in the nose once this gets a chance to warm up. Another absolutely incredible beer from Short's. Wonderful beer from a wonderful brewery.","FtownThrowDown","Jun 06, 2009"
3.82,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is not one of my favorites in the imperial series (pretty high bar) and the sweetness is enough to limit the drinkability.

4.37,13.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Medium body and creamy with good carbonation. This was wonderful brew and a gem in a great series of beers from Short's. The last of the Imperial Series for me and it just leaves me wanting more, so give me more Joe!!","orbitalr0x","May 04, 2009"
3.32,-13.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability- Overall this brew isn't bad it just has two things about it that I don't necessarily appreciate in a beer. The metallic grape thing and the cloying aspect. Big turn offs for this guy. I do appreciate what Joe was going for in this beer though and I wonder if more of the nuttiness would have showed fresh. Either way thanks for the opportunity Derek!","younger35","Feb 12, 2009"
3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste starts with semi-sweet cookie dough malt with a woody edge. Graham cracker mixes with light fruit notes. Subtle vinegar and tart cherries (Flemish Red or Oud Bruin) throughout. Woody, nutty (pecans?), with maple syrup and a faint smokiness in the finish. Lingering vinegar and cherry pits. Medium-bodied, with a smooth feel. I didn't expect this to be so Flemish! Reminds me of Goudenband.","alexgash","Feb 01, 2009"

3.87,0.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Another unique, delicious beer from Short's. I can't get enough of their beer. The maple syrup and pecans in this beer really set it apart from other nut browns, not to mention the big abv. Thanks again for the treat Derek!","joe1510","Jun 20, 2008"

3.33,-13.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a rich mahogany with a fluffy two finger tan colored head that slowly dies down. Lots of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. A nice wall of lacing is left on the sides. Very interesting aroma of sausage, young maple syrup, and toasted pecans. Caramel malt and cane sugars dominate the nose as well. Smokey wood scents here and there too. Taste is much like the smell but has an interesting spice-like sting to it along with brown sugar and molasses. Aftertaste has a toasted nut flavor with a weak pancake sweetness that dries the mouth. Just not digging the flavor to be honest, probably because it's nothing like I've ever had before. Mouthfeel is warm and medium bodied with a constant carbonation. Drinkability suffers because of the over the top sweetness. Bottle should definitely be shared. I could see people that really enjoy this beer and really dislike this beer, as for me, I'm just about in the middle. Congratulations to Short's for being pioneers in the extreme beer movement. Thanks again Derek for giving me the opportunity to try this truly unqiue beer.","BeerTruth","Feb 25, 2008"
4.17,8.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Ultra malty, smooth, and medium bodied overall. There's a twinge of alcohol under the maple goodness, which slows you down some, but it's not distracting. Very creative and highly recommended!","emerge077","Jan 06, 2008"
