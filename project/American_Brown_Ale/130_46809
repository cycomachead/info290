3.49,-6.7,,,,,,"Aroma is floral, lightly citrusy, with a deeply toasted malt backbone that is accented by hints of chocolate and a touch of roast. There's a bit of caramel sweetness. Flavor reveals more floral hop character throughout, with a deeply toasted, nutty malt backbone. The finish is resiny and fairly bitter. Notes of muted grapefruit counter light chocolate initially. There's a bit of an offputting perfumey character in the aftertaste. Not quite the brew I remember. Too bitter and perfumey flavor for my liking. The aftertaste of medicinal/harsh bittering hops kills it for me.","barczar","Nov 01, 2014"

3.93,5.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured on nitro-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer has a great cascade of golden brown layers. The beer settles into a light amber-brown coloring with a dense, low profile, cream colored head. Aromas of roasty and nutty sweet characters with an overlay of resiny, bright hops. Interesting dynamic. Flavors are very eclectic, and you initially feel like they should clash, but they end up blending very well. Roasty, nutty, and toffee sweet backbone support a bitter and floral hops profile that defiantly pokes through the strongly sweet palate to be represented. This dichotomy gives an interesting and unique balance to the palate. Very tasty. Great frothy, thick cling along the glass as you go. The aftertaste leans more towards the sweet characteristics of nut and toffee, with a creamy, smooth, clean finish.","GarthDanielson","May 27, 2012"

It smells of some dark toasted malt, and a nice big hop presence. There are some aromas of chocolate, caramel, and nuts as well. The taste starts off with a nice bit of toasted malt in the background and a big spicy hop flavor in the forefront. There is a pretty big chocolate presence, as well as some mild caramel and nut flavors. The hops really shined through and added a quite a bit of bitterness. This had a medium body and nice carbonation. It goes down super easy, and it has an extremely creamy feel to it. There is some spiciness and bitterness from the hops. The feel is really nice overall. This has great drinkability. I could definitely drink my fair share of glasses of this a night. It has a really nice flavor, and it is extremely creamy. Although I haven't had the regular version of this beer, I really think the nitro benefited it. It is definitely very interesting as well. It really is in its own category, not quite a brown ale and not quite a black ale. overall, it is just a really great tasting creamy beer.

This brew has a big black licorice and brown sugar scent with sweet malts. Pours into the perfect pint with a deep burgundy brown colour and a huge mostly small bubble head that laces as it recedes. On the taste this brew tastes like it just came out of the toaster and has a big hop bite, the virtual double whammy. Taste starts both with roasted malts and a bitterness but it quickly transitions to a sweet ale with chaulky biterness around the edges, then finishes with a bitterness in the aftertaste that might go into tomorrow. Mouthfeel is not silky smooth, but not over carbonated, and with everything going on, that silky smoothness is irrelevant. This is a very complex and flavorful selection, ideal to be consumed by the tired, poor and huddled masses. Good job BBC, keep up the good work.","mooseisloose","Beers"

The taste of the hops and bitterness level does not become overly aggressive yet lasts into the finish as the brown has a dry ending. This was a tasty brown ale, but not as hoppy as some in the style - it has a good malt flavor profile and it achieves good balance.

It is definitely interesting, the brewery calls it an India Brown Ale, somewhat similar to the new India Black Ale style, but where the Black ale succeeds in balance, the Brown Ale, to me gets a bit lost in it's own ambition.

Reminds me of some of my favorite beers of yesteryear, namely the big brown warmers, now vanished, like Potomac Rappahannock Red Ale and Wilmington Dergy's Amber. Seems to me this kind of rich nutty flavor profile is hard to find these days. Close your eyes and you would think this was a darker beer than it is. Nice amber color but BIG roasty. Well balanced for what is basically a hoppy stock ale. The brown-ness is the thing and you could hardly find a beer that offered more nutty toffee roasty flavor. I'd prefer it to be a bit less alcoholic so I could drink it faster. It pushes the limit on warmth and bitterness for this style of beer. I'd like to try it in a bottle.","DeltaBrain","Aug 26, 2009"

Mostly malt is what my snifer picks up, sweet, and perhaps a bit musty. Smooth and flavorful brew. Caramel malts up front then quite grainy, oily, bitter and hoppy late and in the finish. Notes of burnt toast, caramel malts and resiny, gainy hops. Enjoyable stuff, hop lovers will dig this one, non hoppy beer lovers likely will find this to be overly bitter.

The taste is just amazing starting with a caramel malt and buttery dough tastes with light chocolate that is closely chased from the tongue by a bitter hop kick. They constantly go back and forth and between the sweet chocolate and bitter hop notes. This is extremely smooth (a little more carbonation would make it really pop) and the finish is clean.

The scent of sweet malt seem to stick in the air, a hearty bread aroma is in there as well. The aroma finishes with a nutty caramel fragrance. That malt is strong at the front of each taste, then blending to a nutty, bread flavor. It then finishes with a surprising bitterness at the back, with an earthy and grapefruit citrus flavors. A medium bodied feel at the front, it then gradually gains weight as it reaches the back of the palate. An India style brown ale, the look and aroma makes you think you are about to drink a malt bomb. Then you get that smack of hops at the end, that balances it all out.","cameraman","Aug 01, 2009"

Smell is a bit muted, basically some nice piney and slightly grapefruity hops. Smells like a hoppy pale or a muted IPA. Taste... this is definitely more dark IPA than hoppy brown. A lot like DFH Indian Brown, but I like it more. Resiny, almost leathery hop flavor, mixes very nicely with the dark malt. They dont compete for your attention.

As a fairly unique Brown Ale I would say it scores much better than average.. Some hints of coffee and semi sweet cocoa. Very nice beer overall. Great mouthfeel.

4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is light bodied and slick with good carbonation.","paco1029384756","Jun 03, 2009"
3.8,1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"EDIT: I think it's easy to get excited about this beer because it's hoppy, but I'm not so sure it's warranted. The hops overwhelm the malt, and the flavors don't mesh as well as I'd like. It feels like someone took 1/2 of an IPA or strong APA and then mixed it with a brown ale. In some ways I think the "hoppier is better" bias is probably inflating the scores on this one a bit. It's good, but not great.","Domingo","Jun 01, 2009"
3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Very clear dark brown, red color. Aroma is a mix of sweet smelling cascade hops and a twinge roasted coffee. Nice lacing up the side of the glass. This is a very interesting flavor. Almost a mix of an ipa and a porter. Roasted coffee upfront with a bitter hops backbone. The cascade hops compliment the coffee very nicely. Taste is not overpowering so you could have a few of these at a time.","flexinwext","Beers"
4.42,18.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear dark amber with a creamy light tan cap that leaves sticky lace on the glass. The nose is piney hops and citrus peel with toffee. The flavor is resinous cascade hops with nice roasty caramel/chocolate malt flavors to balance. This beer tastes very fresh and delicious. Smooth and medium light bodied with a lingering oily hop bitterness in the finish. The style is listed as an "India-style brown ale" on the bottle, a beautiful hybrid.","biggred1","0"

3.95,5.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: A solid anniversary ale from Boulder. Seems like the hopped-up American Brown Ale is a thing other breweries are trying to do, and I like the possibilities of where it can go. Give this one a shot for sure.","asabreed","May 20, 2009"
3.87,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"not sure how limited this one will be, but it would be a nice fall beer for Boulder to consider putting into their rotation","SPRichard","May 19, 2009"
3.85,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D - Very drinkable. Not too high in alcohol to keep one from having a couple.","JMBSH","May 19, 2009"
4.05,8.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Grapefruity cascades on the nose. Good blend of caramel, chocolate and hops on the palate. Low to moderate bitterness. Round, smooth, medium body. Good beer, think I'll have another.","BradLikesBrew","May 18, 2009"
3.91,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Smooth, flavorful and balanced. I could knock back a few of these. Disguises the moderate ABV well.","Haybeerman","May 18, 2009"
3.56,-4.8,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours a nice brown amber color with a whole bunch of visible carbonation. Big fluffy off white head that is slow to dissipate, leaving clingy lacing. The smell kind of reminds me of a red, also including faint citrusy hop notes and roasted malt. Roasted malt and some citrus bite (minimal) on the front with a slight skunky flavor, then finishes with a mildly bitter aftertaste kind of like semi-sweet chocolate. The bitterness is just about perfect. The mouthfeel is ok, mildly viscous and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is alright, goes down fairly easy and at 6.8% it's not killer. I would probably score this again.","BDLbrewster","May 18, 2009"

4.15,11,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability overall is excellent a quality sipping and quaffing brew that will lead to great discussion and contemplation of brewing styles. Here's to thirty more for Boulder Beer, I definitely love me some Mojo Risin', keep churning 'em out.","WVbeergeek","May 15, 2009"

3.83,2.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Ahh!my cask I could find on the trip, enjoyed at The Ginger Man. Good Bitterness, roast and moderate carmelness, all give the bitterness a good tastiness. Dark brown with a caesar crown head. Very drinkable cask, I could have this frequently.Aroma may have been there on-tap.","Sammy","May 14, 2009"
4.13,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D- Smooth and velvety, not overly bitter, and has a moderate ABV. I would enjoy sessioning this.","UA8","May 13, 2009"
3.9,4.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall, I would say that Boulder has a hit on their hands here. I would love to see this as a seasonal beer, maybe for the Fall. I would put this in the same league as Red Rocket Ale as far as hoppy ambers ales go. And yes this beer is amber, not brown like the label states. Highly recommend this one.","OldSchoolGamer","May 12, 2009"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I am normally not a fan of Boulder Beer. The Hazed is the only beer they make that I can really stand by. Like the Hazed the hop profile here is excellent; however, I would like a bit more 'brown' in this india-style brown. That being said, this may be my new favorite from Boulder Beer.","bluetravlr","May 09, 2009"
3.62,-3.2,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"d: interesting and mostly good balance of activity here, enjoyed the carbonation-to-smooth transition","belgbeerdrinker","Apr 14, 2009"
3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is neither an IPA nor 19%, not sure who entered this beer...Nice amber color, ample tan colored head. It smells like citrusy hops and the taste is a lot more of the same with a little bit of a dark maltiness. This is pretty good and something I will probably buy a couple more sixers of before its gone.","ArrogantB","Beers"
4.08,9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"EDIT: So, I just looked this beer up on Boulder's website, and it weigh's in at 6.88% ABV. I guess I high-balled it a little. Obviously it was listed wrong on BA. How does a beer get added without it being reviewed anyway??","KeefD","0"
