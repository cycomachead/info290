Smell is big spicy rye, vegetal hops, and some toffee-biscut-caramel. Thick mouthfeel up front that lightens as it goes down. Low carbonation. Spicy rye takes over with a sweet malt finish. Was hoping for a bit more sweetness, given the carbonation but overall a well done rye.","BMMillsy","Apr 08, 2013"

4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Right off the bat without knowing anything about this beer I smelled oatmeal. It was real rich. Ok, starting from the top, the beer was a very dark shoe polish brown with some bubbles on the top, not much lace, none at all actually. Smell is oatmeal as stated above. It is rich with some caramel and rye alt backing with some earthy hop aroma. Maybe some cocco with warming. Rich malt profile throughout without overkill. Taste is pretty nice, I get a lot of flavor. Not knowing the age of the keg, I have to say it is at least drinking well. Tastes include some nut flavor with oatmeal, rye malt flavor, some dark fruit appeal, mild hop intrusion and some baked bread. It comes together nicely. Although Browns are not my thing, Florida seems to pump out some nice big versions of them. Heres to hoping more sees it's way up to Philly on a more annual basis, besides the maduro.","BARFLYB","Jun 06, 2012"
4.11,9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Dull brown pour with a creamy tan head that holds strong despite its 9%abv...it looks thick and stagnant with its dense body and heavy sediment. The nose is a weak jumbling of favors that are rather hard to decipher. There is a definite booziness and spice, but it's not pronounced. However, the taste is an intense chocolate milkiness with a nice complimentary spiciness from the rye and hops. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and drinkable with great balance between the intense flavors. It's definitely a big beer that I'd expect from ccb, but it's quite drinkable at the same time. Very tasty and would probably be great in white oak.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 03, 2012"

Smell is of malt, rye, brown sugar, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a pretty harsh level of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer some some harsh flavors going on.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 01, 2012"

Working your way through a bomber is kind of a journey. I had to rewrite this part of the review because initially I said I was glad I tried it but would not likely buy it again, mainly because I'm not a big fan of phenol-y/band-aid-y Islay malt notes, but would be happy if you served it to me at your house so we could talk about it. But now at the bottom of the glass I've changed my mind. I want to take this journey again! It's not something you'd drink every day, but it's such an interesting thing that it wants to be a special occasion brew. It defines an evening.

The aroma suggests a yeasty evergreen with malty herbal hop hints. The flavor brings buttery root beer with alka seltzer rye. It has nuances of a flemish sour while keeping touch with the malt grain. Solidly medium bodied with mild carbonation and a near creamy feel. Drinkable enough and one of the better tasting brews I’ve had in a while!","Durge","Apr 04, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, oatmeal, rye, dark fruit, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, wood, oatmeal, dark fruit, rye, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had this one awhile back out of the bottle and thought I would revisit it. I wasn't a HUGE fan back then, so let's see how that has changed. The tap was much better in my opinion as it felt a little more balanced than out of the bottle. The aroma was quite pleasant but not otherworldly. The flavor on the otherhand was very nice and kept me going back for sip after sip after sip until there was no more to be had. A really well done and put together brew that I'm glad I got the chance to revisit.","thagr81us","Feb 26, 2012"

3.83,1.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice deep brownish red color and produced a massive four finger creamy tan head. The nose is soy sauce, rye, and hops. I have never quite smelled a brew like this before. A lot of people say they get huge hints of sourness in the nose, but I don't find that to be the case here. There is definitely a mild tartness coming through, but to call this beer sour would be ridiculous (unless of course your bottle is infected). The taste is much more flavorful and complex than the nose indicated. It starts out tasting like a brown ale, but then rye quickly makes its presence. The beer finishes with a long dry bitternes. The mouthfeel is not thin, but not as thick as I had hoped/anticipated. Carbonation is tame. Overall, a very interesting offering from Cigar City. This seems to be hit or miss for most people, but I find it to be pleasing. For 9% abv, I don't taste it at all. In fact, I would have guessed this was a 6% beer. While this is tasty, I would have liked to have seen some more sweetness; this is the only thing missing from making this a great beer. This is not for everyone, but if you are looking for something different, give this one a try.","hmf05","Nov 03, 2011"

Intense rye and oatmeal character, roast with overlying burnt bandaid and phenolic notes. Sourness present with this is unbearable. Medium thin-body, sour and completely unpleasant.

The taste of the beer was roasted with an interesting amount of spicy rye and citrusy hops. There was a lot going on in this brew, it's hard to pin point specifics really but I found it to be a very neat beer.

The head pours huge, and there is a minimal cascade with the pour while the head settles out. Aromas are strong rye, caramel sweetness, and a slightly toasted note. The beer's scent also has some slight citrus highlights, also. The beer has a wild blend of flavors, including a smooth, roasted coffee bitterness, tart grapefruit highlights, semi-sweet and dark caramel sugary flavors, and a heavy hopping at the end to pull it all together and dry it out.

Hops are present in quantity, a litte citrusy, combining with some alcohol to produce a little bit of solvent like note.

4.15,10.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Both the touch of roast and to a lesser degree the spicy grain character accentuate the sharper, not quite harsh, herbal and bitter hop notes that dominate this beer; it is not enough to really detract from the beer, but it keeps this from being wonderfully integrated. I have yet to really find a dark malt leaning, super hoppy beer that doesn't do this and it has honestly made me think that if you want a really hop focused beer you should not add any dark / roasted leaning grain notes to it. Having said that, this beer definitely is quite tasty, definitely enjoyable and something I would happily drink again; it is just that the hop character would be so much brighter, smoother and well integrated without the roast grain notes (though I wouldn't mind seeing the spicy rye component staying on). In the end this is a fantastic beer that I can't quite help thinking is a bit Bi-polar in character.","Gueuzedude","Jan 30, 2011"

The rye spiciness compliments the citrus hop character. The taste is good. It has a solid malt bill that produces a dry roasted flavor as well as a spicy rye edge. It goes down smooth and easy with a dominating hop bitterness that resinates in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific beer.

Taste starts off sweet with brown sugar dominating; rye adds a bit of dryness but none of its usual spiciness. Very smooth brew thanks to the oatmeal, and the brew ends well balanced on some dry and bitter notes.

I'd give this a little more credit on appearance if the head wasn't caused in part by the obvious infection. The smell is reminiscent of an oud bruin, as this brown has a bit of a sour component. Sweet malt and spice are also evident. The taste is fairly sour with a considerable hop presence. There is a nice rye flavor that really comes through and the alcohol is well-hidden. If you have any of these bottles, I'd say drink them now, because the infection is there but it isn't all that unpleasant currently. The beer is too light-bodied for my liking and the carbonation is too high, but there is a nice dryness. Not very drinkable, but the flavors are moderately interesting and the alcohol is well-hidden. Overall, I'd like to give this beer another shot when the release it next time to see what it truly can be without the QC issues.

I was hoping the oatmeal would give a nice smoothness, adding to the drinkability, and the rye seems like it would have been a nice touch, but this really really didn't work.

Alcohol well integrated. Hmm, with some of my favorite adjuncts (brown sugar, rye, oatmeal), I thought I would've liked this a lot more.

A smooth flavor from the oats followed by the spicy/sour rye. This brew really highlights the hops, rye and oat.

Taste: big time roasted flavors, rye spiciness, juicy tangelo, chocolate and a slight burnt note. Yeah, there's a lot of usually disparate things going on, but it all fits well as a dark ipa/dipa. Mouthfeel: full bodied, nice carbonation with oat smoothness. Unfortunately instead of the oats leaving a clean dry feeling, an odd powdery feel coats the tongue after each sip.
