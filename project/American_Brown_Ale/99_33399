3.8,12.4,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Review for CHAI BROWN not currently on BA but want to track all my beers in 2015. Saranac was one of my first craft beers over 20 years ago! Surprisingly liked the chai brown, more of a holiday beer. Nice dark brown flavor and strong spiced aroma. Good spice vs brown malt combo, neither overwhelms the other, taste settles evenly and lingers in the mouth. Well worth a try, this was a good,standard consumer beer.","hotpauko","Nov 01, 2014"

3.63,7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This was a pleasant brown ale. I would actually put this a step above Sierra Nevada’s Tumbler Autumn Brown. I didn’t have any artificial smokiness or sugary notes. This is everything I would expect in an American Brown.","CraftBeerTastic","Aug 06, 2011"
2.92,-13.6,3,3.5,3,2,2.5,"Mahogany in color. The head, at first, is about half a finger but thick and creamy. It quickly disappears and becomes nothing but a small lace around the rim. Nose has a Nutty fruit aroma with a large caramel malt background. Flavor is similar. At first there is the caramel and toasty malt but it instantly changes to a smooth caramel sweetness with a candied fruit sweetness for the finish. The sweetness cloys, on the finish, after a couple of sips which leaves a scratchy feeling at the back of my throat. I get this feeling with overly flavored fruit beers and saisons. I'm all set after half of one of these.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 03, 2011"
3.53,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A nice brown ale. It could be a little more full-bodied and offer a more intense flavor profile, but still very enjoyable.","tdm168","Aug 02, 2011"
3.42,1.2,2.5,3,4,3.5,3,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a deep amber-brown color, slightly hazed, with a very thin layer of biege head. Aromas of maple and nut sweetness, blending well together and refraining from being overpowering. A nice, sweet, smooth nose that is light and welcoming. Flavors are nutty initially, with a roasted character, and the beer opens up over the middle of the tongue to reveal a tart and sweet dark fruit note, as well as some earthy flavors blending into the tangy caramel malty backbone. The body is a little lighter than I prefer for the style, with no signs of lacing and an almost watery feeling in mouth at times. Interesting blend of flavors, which transition into a tangy and sharp aftertaste that coats the mouth and jabs the tip of the tongue. The finish is a little on the cloying side, but not overly so despite all the sweet characteristics throughout. Decent brew.","GarthDanielson","Jul 28, 2011"

3.53,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer is mahogany colored with an inch of tan head that leaves plenty of lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is pretty weak, with some toasted bread, malt, caramel, and nuts. The flavor is OK, with a light roast presence. The hop character is amped up a bit more than expected. The body is thin, with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a drinkable brew, but nothing special or exciting happening here.","Huhzubendah","Jul 01, 2011"
3.38,0,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is thinner than expected and hoppier than expected.

3.11,-8,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Out of a Saranac sampler into my Perfect Pint glass, this beer pours chestnut brown with a billowing cream head that retains well and leaves lots of lace. Behind that great appearance is not much. The beer smells somewhat toasty and a little chocolaty. The taste says Mild to me, even though the ABV is too high for one. Burnt toast, bittersweet toffee and a slight astringency are all I'm really getting out of this. Balance is good, but there's no discernible hop flavor. Finishes dry, with lingering burnt toast flavors. In the mouth, the body is medium and dry with about the right tingle. Overall, I'm not loving this, but it's OK.","Rayek","Mar 13, 2011"

3.62,7.1,5,3,3.5,4,4,"12oz bottle purchased as part of the "What Ales You" mixed 12pk. Pours a crystal-clear brown-copper body with nearly two inches of khaki-colored head that slowly dissipates leaving some really decent lacing, especially for the style. Sweet maltiness comprises the aroma, with nut, chocolate, and caramel notes, though you really have to look for them. Dark chocolate, caramel, and nut equally comprise the flavor. Subdued but not necessarily bland, with a good balance. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Nothing special, but not offensive. A decent, if perhaps pedestrian, brown ale.","MrHurmateeowish","Feb 18, 2011"
3.88,14.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A clear light brown with a sizable head and good lacing as I drink. Rich malt and yeasty fruitiness with each sniff. Some butterscotch and toasted bread with a bit of floral hops. Taste is malty up front with toasted grains and a toffee like sweetness. An English ale fruitiness flexes above the butterscotch from the nose. Nice dry hoppy bitterness in the finish has a flourish of grapefruit and leaves buttered scones and graham crackers mixed with hop oil. This one tastes like a West Coast brown. Soft smooth feel is enhanced by gentle carbonation and a proper bit of weight, but not too heavy. Quite drinkable and a delicious fall and winter session ale even at six percent.","scootny","Feb 17, 2011"
3.41,0.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is light, a bit of iron and kind of a dry but slightly bitter finish, theres some chewy darker malts and it's pretty dry. It's a brown ale so there isn't too much exciting about it, but it does a good job at it.","kingcrowing","Feb 07, 2011"

Head retains fairly well and leaves a ton of sticky lace coating the glass. Aroma has some sweet malty notes of caramel that is somewhat nutty as well. Also picking up on some citrus hops and some mineral/metallic notes rounding out the rest of the character of the nose. Taste is a little bitter upfront before the malt presence comes into play. Flavors somewhat nutty and caramel like. Minor bitter hops round out the finish with a trace amount of alcohol. There is a lingering taste of hops and minerals left lingering in the mouth. Medium to light feel with a moderately high amount of carbonation. Overall not bad, the last time I had this beer I distinctly remember picking up on some chocolate notes which were not there this time. Regardless, not bad but nothing to go out of your way for.","stakem","Mar 25, 2010"

Initial scent reveals straight malts with some nutty hints to it. After a while it seems like the initial malts fade and a nutty/metallic characteristic takes over. Not really impressed at all by the smell, also I get no hops they speak of on the bottle in the aroma. Taste is better than the smell (seems to be the case with all the Saranac stuff I have had). Overall hints of malts, nutty flavors, maybe a tiny bit of sweet chocolate and a hop aftertaste to finish the beer. As with the smell it seems to fade to nutty flavors/malts with a hoppy/metallic after taste, which takes away from the beer for me. To me the beer just has a plain brown ale taste to it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but has good carbonation and a nice flavor coating on the mouth, no noticeable alcohol at all in this one either. For my drinkability system it is decent, the beer is not the greatest tasting which factors in a lot for drinkability. It was cheap for a craft beer but I probably wont buy it again, the flavors fading over time also takes away here, I think this one will taste bad after two bottles or so.","cbutova","Aug 26, 2009"

There is a definite toasted chocolatey malt presence throughout. There is a bit of a dry hoppy bite in the finish. There is also more than a touch of bittering malty caramel in this beer.

This is basically a dessert beer. I can't say I'm usually a fan of sweet tasting beer, but when you accept this for what it is, you start to realize how much it tastes like a quality dessert item. It's like a caramel chocolate cake with coffee liquor soaked into it. It's not something I would want to drink all night. Actually just the thought of that gives me a tickle in the back of my throat like I just guzzled pure maple syrup. No, this beer is meant to be drank one at a time. It's a beer you drink very slowly which would make it a great beer to end the night on. I think I like this beer so much because it's a bit more like a porter than a brown ale.

Perhaps it needs to mature a bit longer? This experience is really like drinking a solid American Pale Ale rather than a Brown.

4.12,21.9,4,4.5,4,3,4.5,"Good roasty flavor after a sip followed by a polite helping of hops nothing overpowering altogether a surprisingly good beer by Saranac even though it does quite a bit remind me of a Sammy A","BagOHaZe","Nov 24, 2006"
3.57,5.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D: Not bad. This one was different from most brown ales, which l liked. Could use a touch of tweeking, but could easily be an innovative brew. Worth trying.","Frozensoul327","Nov 24, 2006"
3.82,13,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Another new offering from Matt and I really like where they were going with this one.Poured a medium chesnut brown with a thinner but well reatined off white head,ahh nice hops in the nose Pacific NW cascades give off a healthy dose of pine and grass intertwined with some chocolate malt.The flavors dont quite live up to the nose but it has its own character quite dry and resiny with lighter chocolate and caramel tones.Good to see Matt push the bar a little with this one nice hop profile and very drinkable.","oberon","Nov 23, 2006"
3.85,13.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"From the 2006 Winter Seasonal Pack. 12 ouncer, no freshness indication. Pours a warm shade of darkish amber, clear, dart tan head, scattered lacing upon a gentle swirl. Nose is caramel malts, light pine needles and orange. Flavorful Brown, maple malt o'pleanty, I agree with another rater that this is one of the best in the box...which is not saying a great deal, but this is a pretty tasty and worthy brown ale...","Billolick","Nov 21, 2006"
3.76,11.2,4,3,4,4,4,"From the 2006 Winter Sampler. Interesting take. IMO not really on style but one of the better selections in the Sampler. Look is right on style with very good lacing which keeps for entire drink. Not much aroma, but the taste is what is most surprising. The first thing you taste is the hoppiness of the beer, which almost immediately gives way to a licorice flavor. No chocolate to speak of but a hint of roastiness, not much hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is ok. While not a traditional take, very good nonetheless.","sraimondi","Nov 19, 2006"
3.45,2.1,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"The taste is more of that citrusy and grassy hops, with a distinct nuttiness in the background. Very little malt character. Blindfolded you could almost mistake it for a pale ale in my opinion, the hops were that prevelant. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't an awful beer, but I was expecting a brown ale and this sure didn't taste like one. Mouthfeel was chewy and full. It's a fairly drinkable ale. Really it's not bad. Just not what I was expecting, and not a good example of a brown, in my opinion.","BBM","Nov 19, 2006"
3.9,15.4,4,4,4,3,4,"Winter pack beer....Pours a dark brown color with a big, thick head with good retention and lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). Has a fairly malty smell to it...with hints of fruitiness, and nutiness. The taste goes along with the smell..suprisingly malty with a definate fruitiness and nutiness. Not very bitter. Has a lighter feel in the mouth with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a good beer..one I would suggest to others...","dustylong","Nov 17, 2006"
3.23,-4.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D: I have noticed that all Saranac beers taste somewhat similar, and that disappoints me because I have held Saranac in high esteem since my earliest introduction to craft brewed beers. I will continue to give them a shot in hopes of a turn-around.","akorsak","Nov 16, 2006"
4.07,20.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Highly carbonated, almost overflowed in my pint glass with a moderate pour. Appealing red hue with a very large thick head of big tan bubbles. Aroma catches me off guard A bit of a centennial(?) hop nose. Light sweet grapefruit? Taste is rich with a nice blend of the citrus hops and a bit of chocolate malt. Lingering pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. No where near what I was expecting. A very pleasant surprise. A departure from the same old sweet/burnt/musty brown ales, but not quite the same as a regular pale ale or hoppy amber. Great beer.","sacfly","Nov 14, 2006"
3.71,9.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: decent brown ale that can be considered a session beer. Not a flavor cutting edge brown ale, but a solid offering worth trying.","Gavage","Nov 13, 2006"
3.78,11.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,"I think Saranac may have a winner here in their mixed twelve. this is by far one of the best of the twelve, and one of their better offerings. It is not a fantastic brown, but I'd consider it a nice, light, session beer. It's good enough to enjoy, but not complex or interesting enough to make you really think about it. Fairly generic as brown ales go.","phisig137","Nov 13, 2006"
3.19,-5.6,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. The appearance was quite nice; a full-bodied, dark brown color with a off-white head. The head was so thick that I had some problems smelling the contents of the beer. A slight tilt towards the nostrils exposed the hoppy smell. At first, all I tasted was hops but about a quarter to halfway through the beer, the slightly chocalate malt began to show itself, being balanced off by the hops. The mouthfeel was not as thick as I had hoped it to be. Once you get into the beer, it's pretty drinkable, but the hops hit you on the first sip (about as hoppy as a pale ale).","maddogruss","Nov 06, 2006"
3.63,7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A hoppy brown ale from Saranac, who'd expect that? It's not up to an indian brown, but the hops are on par with at least an average tasting pale ale. The brown does get a little lost in here. There's a hint of malt in the aroma, with a little sweet caramel and chocolate in the flavor, but grassy and citrus hops dominate this brown. That not necessarily bad, but this beer would stand up better with more of a malt profile to compete with the hops.","tempest","Oct 31, 2006"
3.6,6.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall an easy drinking brown ale. A step up from the nut brown.","plaid75","Oct 24, 2006"
2.66,-21.3,4,3,2.5,3,2,"Not very good. I poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. There was a ton of head with a good retention time that left lots of sticky lace. The smell was very sweet, and reminded me of wisky. The taste was also sweet too, but not that bad, the malt wasn't blended very well. Don't drink and review.","treehugger02010","Beers"
3.62,7.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I like sweeter, maltier brown ales, but this is an ok example of a quite dry, moderately hopped one. A decent addition to the winter sampler.","shirfan","0"
