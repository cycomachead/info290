4.72,15.1,4.75,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,"Another fantastically unique beer from Dogfish Head.  Like Namaste or Aprihop, Indian Brown Ale makes a strong case for DFH's "other" beers that aren't really as well known as their 60 or 90-minute IPAs, at least not in WI.  Like the aforementioned "other" beers, Indian Brown Ale is a superior and unique take compared to the standard for it's category.  Too hoppy to be a true brown ale, but too malty to be even an English-style IPA.  The hops take the edge off of the big coffee and caramel flavors, and this beer feels light for its style.  I don't drink brown ales often, but this will be my go-to from now on.","milwaukee512","Friday at 07:02 PM"

Nevertheless, a thin ring of lace persisted throughout the drink. The aroma was malty and also reminded me mainly of coffee. There was also elements of alcohol. I also detected a citric aroma that reminded me of orange peel. The taste was very interesting in that it featured many sweet malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel and sugary tastes; yet, it was balanced by a slight hop finish that left a bitter aftertaste. The finish also had boozy overtones, and reminded me of scotch or bourbon ales. The feel was creamy and full bodied, with slightly low carbonation. Overall, I was impressed by this brew.

It's astonishingly dark (I could see the brown only by holding it up to the light) but r gorgeous. Looks more like a scotch ale than a brown. The nose mixes caramel and a bit of citrus and pine. The taste feels unbalanced when really cold but as it warmed the caramel and nutty qualities evened out the hoppiness. A true hybrid and a great fall beer.","Qbdoo","Oct 04, 2014"

APPEARANCE: Wow--allows a look through its body only when held to light--glass is black as a Wraith; the head is two-fingered, off-white and thick.. AROMA: wonderfully balanced: hoppy and citric, with raisin and plum, yet toasted with biscuit... the malts predominate, with a hint of roasted nuts and caramel--intense and robust ... PALATE: thick, creamy, and rather soft in ts carbonation--that classic cola mouth feel; slightly bitter at its end ... TASTE: the aroma sets this beer’s flavor, as dense, blanketed hops give way to unsweetened chocolate and toasted rye bread--a wondrously stout yet drinkable brown, that only hints at the alcohol it wields... OVERALL: what a drink with which to welcome crisp fall nights--strong, stern and warming, yet balanced, complex and highly drinkable...another victory for Sam and the guys at DFH...","dacrza1","Aug 29, 2014"

4.14,1,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured into a tumbler, it is dark reddish brown with a very persistent dense foamy tan head. It smells of coffee, oranges, and molasses. Taste is biscuity, it has a floral hop brown ale thing going on but its got more going on as well. I get some licorice on the finish, its almost as easy and non-challenging as a brown ale but then it sneaks up, grabs the cap off your head and runs away when you're not looking. I'm sure that must be what the official brewery tasting notes must say. Mouthfeel is medium weight with nice laid back carbonation. Overall, a very good beer, especially for a damp cold day.","roblowther","Feb 09, 2014"

The smell is ok, its that of a fine sugary malt, with a nutty roasted chocolate feel, and a sharp hop bitterness. Hints of smoked wood, vanilla, and faint alcohol also fill the nose. This beer hits your mouth with a big roasted nut, smoked meat, and sweet chocolate/toffee taste. Then a subtle but very present bittering hop feel on the finish. The mouthfeel has a nice well balanced sweet, sugary, creamy feel that leaves the mouth craving another sip. Overall, this beer is is very nice. Alot of complexity and flavors that seem to bin themselves together nicely. Well worth the 10 bucks for a 6'er.","gabedivision","Dec 25, 2013"

However I actually really like the subtlety of the IPA qualities, and I would totally recommend picking up a pack! My only complaint is that it's not too readily available in the Bay Area. Because it has complex flavors, is easy to drink, and blurs the line between multiple beer styles, I can totally see this being a "gateway beer" for people reluctant to try hoppy or dark beers.","Erbayd","Nov 18, 2013"

The entire experience of it is fairly unexpected, yet inviting and strangely familiar. It's a heavy enough brew to be very satisfying, but not so heavy that it could not be a session beer. I would happily spend a night drinking glass after glass of this stuff. The taste and aroma are layered and quite complex, as Dogfish brews are wont to be. Like the 60 minute IPA, the Indian Brown Ale is a refined experiment in craft brewing gone so, so right. Grab a 6-pack and enjoy!","HookerBrews","Sep 23, 2013"

4.4,7.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"The Indian Brown Ale poured a deep dark brown with ruby hints and a decent tan head. There was loads of chocolate syrup in the aroma with some sweet malts as well. The initial taste hit me with straight up chocolate syrup that faded to a slight bitter hop burnt malt on the back end that coated my palate. This was truly a hybrid beer, but more towards the Scotch Ale/Brown Ale spectrum with the IPA notes on the tail end that kept it from being overly sweet. As it warmed I picked up notes of coffee and burnt brown sugar and the bitter hoppiness became more pronounced. It started with the sweet chocolate syrup and ended on the bitter burnt malt & hop profile on every sip.","brurevu","Sep 05, 2013"

It has a unique smell and taste that I had never experienced before (I had never had a brown ale) that seemed sweet, but with enough hops to bring in the bitter to balance the taste nicely. It's the type of beer that I would only drink one or two of at a time, but that is because I take the time to enjoy a beer with such flavor, rather than trying to drink it quickly. I would even say that I enjoy this more than their 60 minute IPA.","B_Sloane89","Aug 20, 2013"

I think it'd be cool to taste this along both black IPA s and brown ales, its pretty unique. The color is also SLIGHTLY lighter than a black IPA but not by much.

The nose is all about the alcohol, the sweetness, molasses and the malt, and the taste starts off sweet and finishes dry as the hops show up dressed to kill, with the raison, chocolate, and alcohol noticeable. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy but also on the thin side. I can't say that this really hides the high ABV, and the sweetness is a bit much for me. This beers works really well, which is an incredible feat considering how bold it is. Personally, I tend to stay away from beers of this magnitude, but I respect the risk taken in making this and the fact that it really is something special.","DeFaz","Aug 03, 2013"

A little bit of light penetrates through making the beer a deep amber color. Seems very dark for a brown ale. Epic lacing. Could not pick up much from smelling this beer. Maybe a little burnt sugar. Taste is full of burnt sugar, bready malts, and crisp hops to balance things out. Kind of get a metallic, bitter aftertaste on some sips right after the hops come through. Gonna let this one warm a bit. As it warms the aroma gets much stronger. I smell alcohol,plums, brown sugar, molasses. Just smells sweet with dark fruits. As it warms the kind of metallic aftertaste is still there but tastes more like i expect the hops to taste. Hoppier than any brown ales I have ever tried and I like it! The hops give it a crisp finish balancing the malt out but this beer is still definitely a brown ale. Hops are subtle and give you a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is excellent. Overall, a solid beer and a must try. I like this hoppier style of brown ale than the traditional myself.","bennett_loves_good_beer","Jul 23, 2013"

The brown sugar is lightly apparent, but not too sweet like you'd think. The aftertaste is well settled and lingers long after. Not sure if I could tell a big difference between this and other dark ales without comparing them side by side. There are subtle hints that would probably be more apparent when comparing a similar competitors together. Generally speaking this was not bad and I would rank this high in the dark styles when preferred.","json83","Jul 19, 2013"

A foundation of roasted malt, dark chocolate, nuts and dark fruit- The best example of an American Brown Ale that I have sampled. Awesome brew.","GossageBrewery","Jun 21, 2013"

Good ABV at 7.2% and the caramelized sugar and roasted taste give it a great balance. This is one of my favorite Dogfishhead beers and if you like brown ales and IPA's, it will be yours too.","HopkingGonzalo","Jun 17, 2013"

It's one of the most well-balanced beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It tasted much closer to a stout than I was expecting it too, with strong coffee flavors aromas and flavors.

When I looked at the beer and poured it, it was clearly a nice brown and heavy beer. I was hoping that i found another good beer however when i took my first sip it was just so bitter. I was hoping for something in the vein of Brooklyn Brown or Newcastle or even a Nut Brown type of ale but it wasn't. To be fair the packaging did say it was hoppy. If you are into the bitter taste then i think you may like it however if you are into a brown ale beer like Newcastle then this isn't for you","edificio5","Mar 01, 2013"
4.6,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Absolutely one of my favorite beers. Pours dark brown with a thick off white head. Coffee, chocolate, and hints of caramel are instantly noticeable in smell. Nice, creamy head with very good lacing. This beer is just such a joy to drink. So smooth and creamy. DFH call this a "hybrid" of an IPA and a Brown Ale, but I think this comes closer to a stout than anything else. Coffee is at the forefront while chocolate and caramel notes follow and a malty aftertaste which I love. Hops, although contributing little to the bitterness, are also present in the taste, like those of an IPA (hence why they call it INDIAN Brown Ale. At 7.2% ABV, this beer is so surprisingly easy to drink. It drinks almost like a session ale since the flavors mask the alcohol so well. If you see this at a restaurant, bar, or store, buy it. Don't think twice.","MisSigsFan","Mar 01, 2013"

The flavor brings out more juniper and malt again with a slight change to the bourbon side of whisky. Some herbal/citrus hop jumps into the picture as your tastebuds adjust to the array of flavors, caramel malt rises nicely throughout. This brew is medium bodied with modest carbonation and a rich, smooth feel. A definite pleaser.","cfalovo97","Nov 22, 2012"

4.73,15.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Indian Brown Ale is a cross between Scotch Ale, an India Pale Ale and an American Brown. The caramel notes from the Scotch Ale blend nicely with the IPA hop flavors. The Brown Ale adds to the richness. It's a very well-balanced dark beer. This is a good winter beer, something I would drink during the Christmas holidays while the wife and kids are drinking hot chocolate. It's very warming and rich with hints of caramel and brown sugar. The buzz I get from it is accompanied with a warming sensation suitable for the holiday season.","DarkBeer","Nov 04, 2012"

3.79,-7.6,4.5,3,4,4,4,"for an American brown, this is a tasty example; i must add that it is much more brown than indian. deep, dark reddish brown beer with a tan head that clings to the sides of the glass. not as aromatic as i would have wanted/hoped/expected. some brown sugar, a little grassiness and some caramel, but little else. you'll get a rich, mouth-coating body on this brew as it crosses across the palate. more caramel malts in the mids, and the hops assert their presence at the very end. i like the dry finish here, but would personally prefer more of those hoppy aromas.","dannydetox","Oct 31, 2012"

Smells of roasted malt and medium hops. Taste reflects the smell but flips hops to the front, and then in the long finish they express even more. Taste also has some caramel and burnt sugar.

I get raisins and molasses with some firepit meat. Some herbal/citrus hop jumps into the picture as your tastebuds adjust to the array of flavors, caramel malt rises nicely throughout. This brew is medium bodied with modest carbonation and a rich, smooth feel. A definite pleaser.","Durge","Sep 12, 2012"

I assumed I would discover those complexities in taste but I did not. To me it tasted like an American stout, making it a disappointment for me, expectation-wise. As a brown american stout it'd be decent, I was just expecting so much more from the unique description.","flyers1980","Jun 04, 2012"

I also smell a touch of floral hops. The taste starts with a nice sweetness, almost like a fruit sweetness, but smooth and malty. Ad the beer glides across the tongue I get a tickle of carbonation followed by a citric hop bitterness and a rich roasty flavor. As the beer warms i notice that the emphasis shifts from the roasted malts to the caramel malt. This is a rather complex beer, drawing together a number of different tastes and styles. It leaves my taste buds slightly confused, but intrigued.","gkunkle","May 23, 2012"

The peat moss really cuts through from the Scotch barrels, which isn't a bad thing, but for some, might throw them off if expecting a standard brown. I love this beer. It really flaunts all sorts of interesting characteristics. Lots of smoke, baker's chocolate, brown sugar and American hops are present. A beautifully complex beer and arguably, yet another classic from Dogfish Head. Sam certainly knows his shit.","Agent1","Apr 11, 2012"

The bitterness and sweetness are in perfect balance and the mouthfeel packs serious creaminess and a clean feel going down. Highly, highly drinkable considering the ABV because let's face it–this beer is downright tasty.","hagbergl","Mar 12, 2012"

I was looking for a good flavorful beer that wasn't too dark, too bitter, etc - this brown was just perfect. It's one of those beers where the hops/malt ratio is just right. There's definitely a sweet caramel flavor - maybe molasses sort of - but not too strong. It's a dark amber but not overly heavy. It's one of my favorite beers - it's sweet but not overdone and you're left with a great flavor. I can't say enough about what a great job Dogfish Head did on this Ale.

That influence is quite prevalent in the flavor too, this is like no other brown I have ever had. To me this tastes like an IPA that a brown ale fell into. Very earthy and floral flavor with the roasted malt mixed in there as well as some coffee. Mouthfeel was very carbonated and active. Personally, not a fan of what is going on here. Executed well, I think, but I just did not like it. To me, I like my brown ales to be creamy, on the rich, sweeter side of things and this beer offer none of that.","denver10","Feb 11, 2012"

After a couple of beers though, those factors stopped playing a factor and later actually became a good point for the beer. Hops are suprising and unexpected at first, but become a bit more enjoyable when you find the balance of this offcentered beer. After initially rating this beer, I had a few more bottles from the 6pack and it started to grow on me so I bumped up the mouthfeel and overall by half a point each. I much prefer drinking it from the bottle than pouring it into a glass. For some reason it just works out better that way with this particular beer.","ZenAgnostic","Dec 06, 2011"

3.87,-5.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Being a big ABA fan, I had to try this brew. Beautiful deep, rich brown with a generous finger of tan head. Spottly lacing with minimal retention. Smell is of coffee, figs, raisins with some toffee/carmel notes on the end. Taste follows the nose with a pretty large kick of hops on the back end which I was not expecting. Lots of flavor and a little booze taste, but not overpowering. Coffee and fig notes dominate early and give way to bitter chocolate. Feel is that of a thick cream with some dry carbonation. A good balance on the tongue. Overall- More of a hybrid than a true ABA. Strong hops and a full body made it an interesting brown. Typically, not a hop head so it was a little bit of a distraction. Kind of a brown IPA. Wouldn't turn one down and merits a try for anyone. Interesting, unique and pretty tasty-","TheDinger","Dec 03, 2011"

As arguably the king of the American Browns, this is New England autumn in a glass, while being enjoyable year-round. Are there more earth-shakingly complex beers out there? Of course, but one wouldn't want to drink a big-ass quad or bourbon barrel-ed double stout every day, much less more than one or two in a sitting. This, on the other hand, is very drinkable (although its 7.2% ABV warrants a bit of caution) and, again, has something for nearly everyone.","SideOrder","Dec 03, 2011"

4.45,8.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Quite possibly the best brown ale on the market. An ale whose complexity and concentration levels break the mold and signal what the brown ale style could become, rather than echoing what it has been for the past several years. Pours a very dark brown with a rich and foamy tan head with excellent retention and lacing properties. Aromas are big on cocoa powder (the kind you stirred into glasses of milk as a child), with a woody, lightly roasted character that is reminiscent of a smore stick after performing its nightly duty. The taste consists of an indulgent but harmonious blend of a milk chocolate/ganache front palate with a burnt toast middle that gives way to a more aggressive, roasty beast-like finish of espresso and wood char. For those out there doubting the terminology of beer descriptions, this is a beer that displays some of nature's most basic flavors with crystal clarity.","droomyster","Nov 08, 2011"

This is not the case, atleast,for me with my experience of it on tap.","brown2cu","Nov 02, 2011"

3.78,-7.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle, bottled 6/24/11, so a little over 3 months old. Pours fairly dark reddish brown color with a nice, fairly dense 2 finger light tan head with great retention that reduces to a small lacing cap. A bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, toasted malt, chocolate, molasses, a bit of dark fruits and spiciness. Some decent aromas here that are on the weak side. Taste of big caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, brown sugar, and spices; with a small hint of nutty flavor as well. A fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of spiciness, caramel, and roasted malts. Medium carbonation and body, with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a warming on the finish, very drinkable. Overall, a very nice brown ale with some unique character.","superspak","Oct 02, 2011"
4.63,12.9,4.5,4,5,4,5,"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It has a nice balance between sweet and bitter.

It smelled a lot like it looked - malty, chocolate-like, but with a bit of a bite that the hops provided. The taste was deep and rich, but with a little bite to confirm to me what the smell forewarned. While I don't know if I'm in love with the marriage of an IPA and Brown, I do have to say that I enjoyed the beer and it's something I'll revisit in the future.","goatsgo2hell","Sep 11, 2011"

The carbonation compliments the hop bite well, and it ultimately goes down well. Dogfish Head has a reputation of crafting exceptionally well made brews (one I feel they have absolutely earned), and this IBA is no exception. If they have this in your local area, pick it up. It has something for everyone. whether you prefer IPAs or darker maltier brews, I think you'll like this one. DO IT!","kemoarps","Sep 02, 2011"

The smell of this beer has a good amount of citrusy hops on the nose, with a more subtle aroma of chocolate malt. The taste of this beer is very hoppy, It's along the lines of some Black IPA's that are available these days. The flavors are sweet and bitter all at the same time. Pretty interesting stuff really. The mouthfeel is average I think, the carbonation in good and it is a drinkable brew. Overall it's a nice choice if you're looking for something new to try.

Sweet milk coffee up front along with lightly toasted malts. Some burnt caramel in the middle. Raisins as well make an appearance. Not as much hops pulling through as advertised. Very coffee like. Sweet brown sugar with bitter hop balance through the middle. Sweet dark fruits give it some depth. Ends with a burnt coffee finish and a alcohol warmth that lingers for awhile. Feels creamy. Soft and with moderate carbonation. Imperial Brown Ale? This is pretty good stuff right here. Very flavorful. This one is for coffee lovers.

A tiny bit of roasted mild coffee. The coffee aroma is cut by a subtle mix of booze and a slight hop that almost smells like a spring morning, fresh and vibrant, earthly and alive yet young. starts a bit sweet, but then an overwhelming hop bitterness follows. The hop is earthy and slightly citrusy. The bitterness carries almost to the end, where you get a bit of the malt found in the aroma. there is a tiny bit of heat at the end, but the hops keep it in check. The roasted coffee is more apparent here than anything else. Finishes smooth and with a second wave of the same hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is pleasant and full bodied. Super easy to drink.

Hints of coffee also appear as the beer warms. The flavor is nice and complex for a brown ale,sweet chocolate and a wonderful malt are up front,with notes of anise/licorice in the middle. An underlying bitterness balances the sweet chocolate and malt perfectly. The licorice lingers and is joined by deep expresso and burnt coffee grinds at the finish.

I got so many different tastes, it was interesting to take more sips and see what I could taste. That said, once Dogfish Head pulled out of Wisconsin, I was "forced" to find new beers to drink and I found that DFH isn't all I thought it was cracked up to be.

3.9,-4.9,4,4,4,3,4,"Overall - This is a very well made, flavored and balanced brown ale. Seems to be more in the British Ale style than American Brown (just my opinion) 7.2% alchohol is strong for this style but its well disguised in taste (but you definitely feel it after 1 beer). Its not a great session beer because of the dry aftertaste but it seems like this would be a great beer to have with a hearty fall feast or Thanksgiving style dinner. Another fine output from DFH.","bubseymour","Apr 17, 2011"

Nice, big fluffy tan head that slowly settles and covers the glass with lace as it does. Caramel, vanilla, some dark fruit, and slight alcohol in the nose. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet, caramel and dark fruit flavors gives way to a roasted bitterness flavor with some alcohol flavors. Its pretty tasty but I think I'd like it a little better with the abv knocked down a tad to really let the hops and roasted notes shine.","kbutler1","Apr 07, 2011"

I really don't know what to classify this as, its like a cross between a porter and a scotch ale. Whatever the hell this beer is really doesn't matter too much cause in the end it tastes damn good. The flavors were complex and balanced very well, I was expecting this to be pretty hoppy and it wasn't and I liked that. I feel if it had more hops then there would be too much going on and it would make it a mess. I would for sure buy this again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark, roasty, and full bodied beers.

Nose was heavy with chocolate, like putting my sniffer into a can of Hershey's Cocoa Powder as I did when I was a kid. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Beautiful! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a melange of cocoa, coffee, charcoal roastiness and some alcohol heat. Zounds! This was like a jolt of coffee to restart my evening accompanied with enough alcohol to send me to slumberland. Mymymy. Finish reminded me of my morning coffee, personally blended by yours truly to mimic the coffee I was weaned on in the Navy. My students often remark on how its odor fills the room.

The charcoal from the nose is larger here. A sweet dinner roll and dough middle with a clean, long, dry finish that highlights the excellent hop blend. Hops are moving from dry and earthy to astringent and grapefruit. Feel is finely carbonated with a decent amount of weight to it. A touch of syrup and yet it never comes off as heavy.

3.44,-16.1,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - There is a lot of potential here, but the hop character seems to be a bit weak. The brown malt character seems to lean more towards sugary flavors of cola, brown sugar, and molasses than malty caramel or toffee; the sugar characteristics give the beer some depth, but they become cloying much more easily than the alternative character would. The hops are much more apparent in the flavor profile than in the aroma and they work well with the roast character, though the dark malt effects them in such a way that they remind me more of a barley wine or aggressively hopped stout than anything that should have "India" in the name. Not a bad beer, but something about the particularly sugary malt character and the weak hop aroma keeps me from wanting to drink another one.","nickfl","Oct 28, 2010"

Smells quite nice until ethanol starts poking through. Fairly similar flavor, with a medium, nearly harsh bitterness and lightly fruity alcohols. Medium body, with a dry, malty/hoppy finish.

This bottle is about three months old so it's a little smooth than normal, as it's lost some carbonation but it still drinks very smoothly and very well.

The nose conprises maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, walnuts, and a touch of flowery oak. The taste brings in an additional bit of mandarin orange syrup, while also maintaining a decently powerful nuttiness. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel.

There isn't much to speak of as far as the head is concerned the ecru foam quickly fades away to a micro film on the surface. The smell is out of this world. It reminds me of some nice creamy milk chocolate with rich caramel notes. There are hints of rich fruit and char to go along with it. The taste is most akin to a nice mocha (sweet coffee and chocolate). There is a nice brown sugar and char flavor that goes along with what might be the bitterness from the hops which are rather nice. The mouthfeel is a tad watery for my liking, but that doesn't mean it's unpleasant.

4.2,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Brewed fresh on 8/12/10, thank you very much. Pours a very dark brown almost black color. The head is somewhat thick and tan. To this day, this is the darkest brown ale I have ever had. The smell is more like a porter to me than a brown ale. It smells like chocolate malts predominately, some faint alcohol, and some hop presence. Tastes like some bitter dark roasted malts, hops go back and forth in the mix, but overall, the beer smacks of fresh roasted malts. The hops are also bolstering the dark bitterness. I gotta say, the IBU's might not be that high, but this is one bitter dark beer! I am sorta shocked cause it seems to come from the roasted malts, not hops, but that could be deceiving. Hmm, this is an interesting beer, nonetheless. To me, this beer has far more in common with a Porter style than an Indian Brown, but has me intrigued what the heck their Wordwide Stout will taste like, let alone their porter. Mouthfeel seems very rich for a brown ale. I won't be holding any of this against them, although this certainly is an in-between sorta beer. I have been really enjoying Dogfish Head lately and although this is anything but normal, it is an enjoyable brew!","Star80","Oct 02, 2010"

2.7,-34.1,4,4,2,2,2.5,"I purchased this particular brew at a beer store in Bend, OR. in the bottle. After getting it to my place of consumption I allowed it to stay out at room temperature for about an hour. Then upon pouring my first bottle into a room temperature pint glass I was greeted with citrusy-floral nodes, a pleasant tobacco fragrance and considerable alcohol scents. As I collected my thoughts, I soaked in the color and noticed the head disappeared so quickly that I did not have time to mentally record what I saw. The color of the beer was medium-dark chocolate to dark brown. My interest was peaking, so I took the first sip. First thing I noticed was that the warm alcohol mouth feel defenitly overshadowed any flavor complexities that might exist. As the beer settles longer on the palate I noticed subtle caramel and roasted espresso bean, while the dry hop finish rounds everything out. While I do appreciate a beer that finishes dry, I also appreciate a beer that allows my senses to appreciate all the complexities the brew has to offer. I was not given that opportunity here. Being that I purchased a six-pack I looked forward to trying another one to see if I was wrong in my first assessment. I was not. I did find, as with many beers, that when I allowed the brew warm up, my palate were able to pick up on some small complexties. The hop character was appealing. Flavor profile was masked by the alcohol mouth-feel and over-carbonation. I am still looking forward to finding this brew available cask-conditioned.","belgiumbud","Jun 02, 2010"

Didn't pick up too much at the bar I had this in. The taste was of light roasted malt, chocolate, peat, wet wood, brown sugar and a grassy hop in the end. This is one tasty brown ale. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes sweet but with a light bitter hop. One of the best brown ales out there, very flavorful.","Gmann","Jan 28, 2010"

Not sure I would call this an Indian brown as there is little-to-no hop presence. Just an all-around good sweet brown.","Onenote81","Nov 06, 2009"

4.41,7.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The nose is excellent too. Once it warms up, there's an excellent combination of pine hop bitterness, chocolate, coffee and a delicious toffee character. Mild burnt caramel character is present as well. The mild sweetness complements the roast, the toffee and the pine character quite beautifully. The flavors are equally good, if not better. Opening with a mild pine bitterness that's quickly overtaken by a melange of malt flavors with brown sugar, coffee, chocolate and some roast. Pine character is perceived on the back as well. Again, the balance is exceptional. Medium bodied with a soft, smooth carbonation and a long lasting complex finish with a blend of burnt caramel, pine and mild sweetness, this is definitely my favorite regularly released DFH brew. Two pints later, I could have gone back for more.","DefenCorps","Nov 04, 2009"

The dark fruits (rasins, dates) are there, but also this interesting spice kick. Bitter finish. The "cross between scotch, IPA and brown ales" is dead on. Quite different (as expected from DH). Superior quality, but I'm not sure if I like it enough to get it again. Definitely worth the first purchase though.","mckajd03","Oct 30, 2009"

The head is off-white to light tan and though it dissipates rather quickly it does manage to stick nicely to the side of the glass and shows some moderate lace. An alluring aroma of roasted malt characteristics like coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is quite deep with chocolate, caramel and coffee along with some subtle herbal notes and a hint of a dark cherry fruitiness. The hop flavor is nicely integrated and is neither overpowered by or overpowering the malt. It has a sticky feeling to it that I found pleasant and not at all cloying, almost like a piece of dark chocolate. Highly drinkable though the high ABV can sneak up on you. The depth of flavor seems to carry the alcohol quite nicely. I can see this beer doing wonders with a decent steak or some BBQ ribs.

The aroma wasn't very strong, has a smell more like a porter than any type of ale. Has the smell of some chocolate malts, then some hops which are not as strong as the malts. I found the taste interesting. Much like the smell, but seems to have a bit more, maybe some dark fruit and/or barley. Extremely full bodied beer, not much of a carbonation bite to it, left my mouth feeling a bit dry though, found the beer fairly drinkable.

Mouthfeel is smooth and thick with a medium to full body. The finish is thick with toasted malt and molasses lingering on the tongue.

Roast, real brown sugar (no synthetics here!) hops toward the finish to swipe the malt out of the mouth and get you ready for your next swig. Light grape notes and subtle cocoa.

The first sip confirms the coffee and nice creamy rich chocolatey malt. It's a sweet combo that really works well with the hops. This is the only brown with any real hop flavor that I have had to date. This beer has a thickness not normally associated with a brown that isn't a nut-brown.

Brown sugar, toffee, black raisin, plum, licorice, chocolate in the nose, obviously more malts than hops, fat enough to settle in fully and stay until closing time. Full-bodied, all roasty and toasty with sweet malt segueing into dark chocolate powder, coffee, brown sugar. Offers golden and black raisins, figs and dates more than any fresh fruit flavors, however, not saccharine. Carbonation and hops ride in just in time to lead into a cleaner finish than expected. Arguably trying to do too much, still, tasty enough.","farrago","Jan 17, 2009"
4.3,4.9,4,4,5,4,3.5,"12oz bottle purchased at the local Hannaford. Pours a translucent dark brown body with a thin film of light tan head. Aroma consists equally of caramel and chocolate malts and citrussy hops. Tastes like chocolate and caramel, with a good portion of citrussy hops to balance it out better than many browns. No alcohol flavor, but a hint of viscosity and warming, along with moderate carbonation. Somewhat of a sipper, though goes down easier than some beers with this abv and flavor... Wow, this is a lot better than I remember it being. A new favorite American brown!","MrHurmateeowish","Jan 16, 2009"
4.3,4.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured with almost no head. What head there was had very good retention. Below average lacing for a brew this type. A rich, deep mahogany that allows just a little light to poke through. A very sweet aroma greets you immediately. Not just the usual malt sweetness that would be expected, but a sugary blast that caught me off-guard. The flavor was not as sweet as the aroma led me to expect. Very nice roasty flavors, although the slight coffee flavor put me off a little. The flavors stick to the tongue but fade before becoming annoying, thus letting you be ready for the next sip. The body is a little thin, a fuller, more well-rounded mouthfeel would be welcome. Very drinkable, although a bit much for a session. A very nice take on the style.","beertunes","Jan 16, 2009"
3.94,-3.9,4,2.5,4.5,5,4,"Poured a deep, lifeless brown from the bottle with just barely enough coffee-colored head to cover the surface of the beer. I found the smell to be this brew's low point--the slightly malty, nutty brown ale aromas accompanied by a strange mustiness. The taste and mouthfeel, however, especially as the beer warmed, was everything I've been seeking in a brown ale. Again, the typical brown ale flavors of malt and nuttiness were up-front, while a solid hoppiness came through alongside a little brown sugar in the back-end to create a delicious balance. Immediately following was this beer's other high point, its silky-smooth mouthfeel. At last, a brown ale that doesn't finish disappointingly thin. Given the balance and great mouthfeel, drinkability was quite good. Overall, this is a tremendous take on the style.","Riccymon","Jan 13, 2009"
3.6,-12.2,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Deep brown with a big dose of carbonation creating a large tan head. Aroma of caramel, cofee, brown sugar and a hint of hops. Rich candy sugar and molases dominate the palate. Creamy mouthfeel. This is probably an excellent example of a style of which I am just not a big fan. Very rich, sweet and filling. No amount of hops can make it through the sugary body. This could probably be matched very with with certain specific foods, but this isn't a beer I would consider drinking with much frequency.","TheDoorman","Jan 11, 2009"

I taste a lot of coffee in this, and blind tasted it might be guessed to contain a bit of coffee. Burnt sugar and lightly roasted malt. Interesting for a brown ale, because it is not overly roasted, and the added sugars for the higher alcohol stand out a bit more. The hops here are more character hops, rather than up front type.","dolemite77","Jan 07, 2009"

When held to the light this beer is quite clear and a dark reddish-brown. Looks great but too dark for the style. Aroma is quiet nice, malty and sweet. At first it seems to be fairly roasty but this soon gives way to more chocolate and caramel aromas with a touch of fruityness and maybe just a hint of hops. Taste is very good, I again find some roasted notes that seem out of place in a brown ale. More chocolate and caramel as well as a bit of toast. Medium+ hop bitterness and a pleasant hop flavor, not American hops as one would expect here but more of a noble-esque hop flavor (the bottle states that Liberty and Goldings hops are an ingredient and if I recall correctly Liberty is a US grown Hallertau derivative). Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium+ body with moderate+ carbonation and a relatively dry finish with some mere indications at the respectable 7.2% ABV. Drinkability is excellent. This beer seemed to be more of a porter at times but was immensely enjoyable. If I rated strictly to style it wouldn't have fared quite as well but given DFH's penchant for innovation I drank this with an open mind. The ABV is too high to be a session beer but I think this makes a pretty good everyday drinker.","mnj21655","Oct 26, 2008"

The aroma is smoky, malty, nutty but nothing too exciting. This is a very drinkable beer. Slightly sweet with a roasted malt flavor and some coffee. Very little bitterness. I'm not really sure why they call it "India" and advertise it as "hoppy" because I really didn't taste a whole lot of hops.

4.08,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a great brown ale, one that I will probably revisit. Quite different from the nut brown ale style, and far more interesting than those typically. The hefty malt is needed to keep the hops from getting out of hand. This is hardly sessionable; I would top out at two. The alcohol plays a role in this, but I felt it more than tasted it.

The nose is a bit weak, but has a subtle maltiness. But sitting in the sunlight, the color is a bit dull, it is too dark to show off its effervescent carbonation, and there is practically no head.

Upon swallowing the taste transitions to an earthy, piney hoppiness. Medium to light bodied with a silky mouth feel. The "burntness" of the grains mingles well with the tingling of the hops.

Dark brown almost black with a sweet coffee smell to it. It hits you with big roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate taste. From the brown ales that I'm used to drinking this is quite extreme tasting almost like a stout.

This is one delicious beer that I would definitely pick up whenever I saw it and would have at any time.

4.47,9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown color with subtle red hues in the light. The head is tight, yet thin and presents itself a pale choclate color. A vigorous swirl of the large snifter brings the head to life for a brief moment and then it settles down again into a thin layer on the surface of the beer. The nose is rich and inviting, with dominant chocolate and roasted coffee notes intermingling with a slightly sweet caramel character. Aromatic and floral hop notes balance the richness of this beer making for a very complex array of aromas in the nose. The palate is also dominated by dark semi-sweet chocolate, espresso, and a very subdued dark caramel malt sweetness that balances the beer well against the bittering chocolate notes and the mildly acidic hop profile. I'm pleasantly surprised by a terrific "butterscotch-like" characteristic that makes this beer all the more interesting to me. The mouth feel is smooth, rich and never cloying. Adequate, but not aggressively carbonated, this beer is a study in the balance of sweet and dry flavors without leaning too heavily on either in my opinion. At 7.2% ABV, you might expect the alcohol to assert itself, but really never does except for the finish, which is pleasantly warm and smooth without being boozy. Otherwise the finish is quite dry with lingering notes of espresso in the mouth. A very, very complex brown ale in every regard. Once again, Dogfish Head had managed to take what I typically think of as a rather mundane beer style and kick it up several notches. This is not your father's brown ale. Incredibly rich, complex and challenging ... I'd be hard pressed to think of a brown ale I've ever had that I enjoyed nearly as much. I'm a fan. Possibly too high in alcohol to be considered a sessionable beer, but I could drink this one often and be thrilled about it. Dogfish Head - changing one man's opinion of brown ale, one beer at a time. I'll need more than one six-pack of this one. Terrific!","beerphilosopher","Mar 15, 2008"

I haven't had a ton of brown ales in the past, but the ones I had were leaning more towards the clear brown side. I didn't take great notes on this beer but what I do remember was how caramel and nutty it was. Just a perfect combination of flavors, bringing all that richness of a porter but leaving out the roastiness. The mouthfeel was a little fuller that I thought it would be. If it were just a tad lighter I would have given it a 4.5 or so because I would prefer less full of a mouthfeel for a brown ale, with just a touch more carbonation in it, but this is splitting hairs with this beer.

The appearance was nice, good dark brown with light brown foam. Nose is lots of coffee malt, but the chocolate flavors that come through so well in the bottle are incredibly muted. Taste is similar. Tons of roasted malt, but the chocolate and fruitiness seem to have disappeared. Basically this one seems like a stout, and I would not have been able to guess that this was the same beer as I've had in the bottle so many times.

Thick, creamy head that yields to a little pale surface fizz with some loose lacing left on the sides of the glass. Opaque, dark brown...a bit like a porter. Darker than, say, a Newcastle. Smells like, well, a brown ale--very straightforward--but sweeter, more biscuity. Much richer than the aforementioned Newcastle--brown sugar, molasses-like. Fairly chewy mouthfeel. Bitter afterburn. Not so sure I am too inclined for a second one in one sitting. Pretty good if you like brown ales, I suppose, but IMO there are more appealing beers out there.","jonworth","Feb 17, 2008"

Flavorful, intriguing yet with an ability to appeal to more than just hop heads, big beer fans and other craft brew fanatics, I think this, along with the 90 Minute, are Dogfishs best contributions to trying to broaden taste profiles of non-craft beer drinkers.","Drewcifer","Jan 19, 2008"

Medium-full bodied, the mouth feel is creamy yet adequately carbonated with a nice hop tingle. The flavor is quite good, but its not a big full flavor, like Empire Downtown Brown. The nose is bigger than the flavor. I'm enjoying that the roasted characteristic is 'in the zone', meaning that its not not 'burnt' or overwhelming. This is a really nice drinker.

Definitely leaves the mouth something to think about for a while after it's gone. Smooth and silky contrasted by abrasiveness of the hops and alcholic heat...

There's a lot going on in the taste as well, which is malty (per the nose) and sweet (sugars and dark fruit) up front before parting for the hops. The alcohol is evident but by no means overwhelming.

The taste was great, good malt back that was hoped to all hell. Very fresh taste, and a sstrong biting finish. Alot of similarity to the Terrapin Brown. Great smooth feel, lots of carbonation made it go down smooth with a nice dry finish. I could easily see myself drinking this on a regular basis. It was really just that good.

You can pick up everything from lighter caramels to roasted chocolates in there, the alcohol is also fairly noticeable especially at warmer temps but stays under the control of malts. A touch of oily grassy hops adds just enough bitterness to make the finish really interesting. The mouthfeel is very thick yet so smooth and very satisfying. Drinkability is good too, considering your mood. Don't grab one of these if your looking for a classic brown ale.

The taste is chocolate, burnt caramel, and a bit of coffeeish flavor as well. It's the burnt almost charcoal flavors that are most characteristic. I'm drinking this on a hot summer day and I need this one like I need a hole in the head. If I only knew, I would have saved it for a chilly January instead. The malts, hops, and burnt flavors are all dancing about and are well balanced in that they all equally hit you over the head. There is nothing subtle about this beer. This is a very good beer, not a nut brown, and definitely not a summer beer. Save it for the winter months and it will be even more greatly appreciated.

Some malt, some coffee, some bitter chocolate, some molasses, but not much any of them. Nice, but not terribly convincing. The taste is where everything begins to come together in my opinion. Rich roasty coffee flavors, mixed with hoppy bitterness, sweet vanilla, bakers chocolate, and woody spices. Very complex. A bit too big for its own britches, to be honest, because it's so damn ambitious, but it's tasty nonetheless. Just like a cross between a scotch ale, an IPA, and an American brown ale should be. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. At 7.2% ABV, I'd hardly call this a session beer, but it's still a solidly drinkable brown. Might go best with some chocolates by the fire in the winter with a loved one by your side. Then again, I'm sippin' on this puppy in the middle of June, and still enjoying it.

4.2,2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours out a dark, leathery cherrywood with a creamy khaki head that clings to the glass and leaves spiderweb lace. In the nose there is chocolate, some roasted barley, and a wonderful underlying presence of the goldings. Flavor errs more towards robust porter territory, and I'm fine with that. Good bit of chocolate with a punch of roast. Hops don't add much bitterness to this, which I think any bitterness perceived in this would partly come from the roasted malt, rather the hops give this an earthy and herbal flavor in the finish. Finish is somewhat drying but there is still some residual sweetness there. Mouthfeel is moderate and the tiny bubbles get a little annoying on the tongue. Very drinkable, but the sweetness and the high abv doesn't make this an ideal session. I really love that this is an American-brewed brown/porter/whatever that doesn't get all muddled up with citric hops. Nice earthy hops accompany the earthy malts well. This is one of, if not the best made beer in DFH's line-up.","goochpunch","Apr 16, 2007"

The beer is a very saturated hue of brown and if you hold it up to light you can see the moderate carbonation. The smell is rich roasted malts that almost have a coffee twist transitioning into a brief pineapple-ish whiff of hops. The flavor is extremely complex. It's like someone took a really caramel/roasted malt brown ale like rogue and mixed with about 5% of an american strong ale like oaked arrogant bastard to come up with this really cool brew. It doesn't have any hop bite, but you can certainly taste them. The aftertaste is also pleasant with a fresh ground coffee feel. I like it a lot.","Rudgers73","Apr 05, 2007"

Its very dark amber appearance initially made me think I was going to experience a porter-like taste, but it was, in fact, a hefty brown ale, true to its moniker. The olfactory senses were enamored by the subtle, yet powerful odor of a medium gravity alcohol aura. It hit the taste buds with alternating tones of java and chocolate, with a faint taste of brown sugar that cleansed the palate. It did not cling to the mouth, but went down clean and easy. Its drinkability quotient is high, because while it is filling, it leaves the beer aficionado wanting just one more. Not too heavy -- just right! Goes well with minestrone and a veggie sandwich.","CanaanBob","Mar 17, 2007"
4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear ruby-brown with a nice, sticky foam head. Smell is an interesting combination of brown-sugar sweetness and hops. Tastes much as the name suggests -- a nice dark-roasted sweetness reminiscent of a brown ale backed with an interesting hop punch on the back end. The sweetness reminds me of the brown sugar listed as an ingredient and combined with the roasted malt conjures images of sweetened coffee. The hops provide a nice bittering and act almost as a palate cleanser here. Overall I think they did an interesting job of combining the flavors and achieve a very nice balance. This will be a regular in the rotation.","WAP","Mar 17, 2007"

The brown sugar is evident in the sweetness but there is also roasted malt, caramel and some hops bitterness. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with some noticeable carbonation.

Hops are there but not overpowering, there is just enough to balance, and there is almost a berry like flavor that comes from the hops and malt together. Full bodied, but not as much as the 7.2% ABV might lead you to believe. Pretty easy to drink.

The taste is amazing- the character of the IPA is present as advertised but it is perfectly balanced by the burnt sugar and nuttiness of the brown ale.

A little smoky, a little brown, a little hoppy, and a little stouty ale-ish with big flavor and a breathy alcohol finish. The first sip was especially smokey and chocolatey but after that I was gulping it down like a pirannha eating this meaty cocoa ale though it became a little watered down from the original coma of hearty stoutness.

I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, but the adventurousness of this offering from Dogfish Head has me curious.","orfeu","Jun 30, 2006"
3.92,-4.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a highly bubbly dark caramel amber color. Lucious off white head appears quickly and sticks around a bit. Aromas are floral hoppy, brown sugar, some tobacco, and a bit of Belgianness. Flavors are well balanced. A rich chocolatey flavor blends well with the spicy, fruity hops. Slightly more bitter for a brown, but a good stab at a different style. Body is light, alcohol warming and carbonation right on. A slick coating of caramel laced with resin sticks around in the mouth. Brown ales seem to be a dying breed in the craft beer world, but this one goes to show you can make one intesting and rather tasty.","dreadnatty08","Jun 27, 2006"

Its thicker than many brown ales, slighly cloying, but very smooth. Not too acidic and the 7.2 percent alcohol goes down very easily.

The taste hits you with those roasted nutty flavors right off the bat then hits you with the hops and follows with almost an oak aged wiskey flavor. This is quite good.

I'm not a hop head by any stretch of the imagination, but I bought it thinking it would be a brown IPA, you know, because they call it Indian Brown Ale and all.

Even the more bizzarre ones at least leave me confused. This isn't a terrible beer, but it isn't one that I would expect a quality brewery to release.

4.45,8.5,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Dense brown with deep reddish hues in the light. Smallish, foamy head that holds on for a while. Smells chocolately, full, and distinctly alcoholic -- the glorious aroma filled my senses as soon as I opened the bottle. Thick brown sugar sweetness that holds on but morphs into a notable burnt-malt porter-like flavor. Hops are muted in this pour due to extended storage but are still full and citrusy, and only more so when fresher. Much like their 90 Minute IPA, the hops could dominate here and wash all else away, but the malt is so intense that it is some how both "extreme" and "balanced." Carbonation is lively -- on par for a brown ale but more than ususal for the porter this brew suggests at moments. Complexities of flavor beyond description -- nothing straight ahead or booring about this delicious brew. Alcohol is noticable but well hidden and serves only to add another layer to the complexity of other flavors. I treat this beer as special and like to drink it infrequently to preserve the gratification factor despite its year-round availability and high drinkability. A must have.","Liquids","Mar 18, 2006"

Taste is wonderful with flavors of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses and cookie dough on the palate and a nice hop bitterness in the backround.

Smell was rather bland, as all I could really pick up was toasty malt, semi sweet sugar and a chestnut character as well. Taste was slightly better then the smell. There are a fair amount of complexities in this beer. The malt hits you up front, but if you let it roam around the palate for a minute, you can really start to appreciate why they call it an indian brown ale when the very decent hop amount pulls through. Started off rather sweet, but ended quite bitter and a little sour. Mouthfeel and drinkability were about on the same track...pretty drinkable. I originally bought this beer because I'm a big fan of IPA's and not so much of a fan of brown ales. Having said that, I think it is time that I give more brown ales a try.

Aroma also offered a hint of roasted malts? I do not think this Brown Ale advertises a roasted barley or malt but I tasted it. The alcohol was present in the mouthfeel but blended wonderfully with the malt. The hops provided an equally potent bitterness to match the alcohol. A small hint of toffee surfaces but diminshes quickly This almost reminded me of a winter warmer minus the spices or adjuncts, although this brew uses some caramelized sugars.

Some nice hoppy floral notes in nose as well as some sugary sweetness and just a trace of alcohol. Tastes of coffee with some oily hoppiness on back of palate.

Though probably my least favorite from this brewery, it's still a very good beer (from a great brewery). A bit on the pricey side versus its counterpart for the style but not in comaprison to other higher gravity beers. Nice combination of a caramel malts, nuts, and chocolate.

4.34,5.9,4,5,4.5,4,3.5,"Poured a dark brown with copper highlights into pint glass. Head was small and quickly faded leaving just a ring with little lacing. Smell was fantastic in my opinion, deliciously appetizing with complex aromas which were heavy on the barley notes with coffee as well as a hoppy and alcoholic zing that cleanses the sinuses. Taste was also much more than I would expect from a brown ale. Very complex with light porterlike coffeetones followed by a sweetness presumably from the caramelized brown sugar but balanced with a bitter bite and aftertaste that sticks around nicely. Drinkablility suffers because of how complex this is as well as the high ABV, one or two in a night would probably be enough for most.","masikon","Dec 03, 2005"

The flavor is wonderfully complex and the flavors you pick out differ greatly with what else youve eaten lately I think my perception of it even changes with my mood. Thats complexity for you! While the aroma was more malt dominant, the hops have a much more noticeable presence on the palate. It has a sweetness thats balanced out by an herbal bitterness. Dark fruit, molasses, soap, resin, brown sugar, cherry, nuts and alcohol. The finish is long, dry and mildly astringent with citrus peeking out from behind the lingering malts.

A true ale based on the level of hops, but the hops are not overpowering the beer at all, like some beers.

The taste is sweet up front, and is followed quickly by very fruity notes that are reminiscent of cherries, perhaps even a bit like cough-syrup (though only lightly so). The finish is long, though not heavy handed and has an astringent roast malt character to it. This beer is quite smooth up front, but finishes with a prickle of carbonation that helps to balance the overall sweetness of the malt. The body of this is fairly light, this beer is quite quaffable.

The taste was full compared to other american brown ales, bigger hop presence and more of a burnt roasted bitterness which was nice, but the mouthfeel was a little too thin which made the whole thing seem unbalanced.

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Not surprised at all by how good this offering from Dogfish Head is. Mostly I go for their IPAs and other stuff but I had this a few times at the Moan and Dove and thought it was great but for some reason never picked up a sixer. Well, tonight was the night, and I'm glad I finally decided to go for the maltier side of Dogfish Head. Appears more ruby red than most standard brown ales, mixed with the traditonal drab brown of course. A bit of white head tops the beer. Smell is creamy and milky, with a touch of bitterness to it. The creamyness comes through in the taste and mouthfeel as well, but the overall taste is much more complex. It has a nice fruityness to it. Dark cherries, ripeness, in addition to the milky creamy flavor. Also, it reminds me of a dark Belgian ale with it's sweet candied sugar taste, which isn't as overwhelming to me as it seems some people have noted. Nice hoppy backbone as well. All of the many tastes in this beer are very well defined and stand out among each other, but also compliment each other. Like I said, I'm not surprised that this beer is as good as it is, coming from one of my fav breweries, but I think I'll be getting it more often now. Cheers.","twelvsies","Feb 28, 2005"

Mild malt aromas rise from the glass. The nose has a mixture of malt sweetness and delicate roast malt character. There is a subtle grapefruit rind backing. The taste is neutral. Not too bitter, not too sweet. It is what you would expect. Its dead between a pale ale and a stout having a darker roast character of the latter, and a mild citrus hop bite.

4.12,0.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours to a thin white head and is dark brown, barely allowing light to permeate. The smell is dark chocolate, floral, brown sugar, coffee, light alcohol, malt. Plainly stated its a smooth beer with caramel, a good note of alcohol, roasted malt and nut passing to a crisp, slightly bitter snap at the back and sides of the tongue as a closer. The 7.2 ABV is certainly in the neighborhood and it calls out but it doesnt need a restraining order. The Goldings and the Liberty hops roll right into the aftertaste and they are tempered by a light caramel sweetness. As the beer warmed slightly during consumption it did become a bit sweeter.

It is very smooth drinking, but can be hard to finish near the end of the beer at times. Overall, this is a nice beer, but not shy by any means.

It had a warming effect, much like a barleywine, but unexpected in a brown ale. Granted, at 7%+ ABV, its not a low ABV beer by any stretch, but I've had 12% beers that masked that alcohol better.

Sticky sweet, but not terribly out of place for a brown ale. Mildly bitter, with more spice coming from the hops here (saaz? Who knows?) Finishes strong with no indication of alcohol hit.

Also, with an alcohol content of 7.2%, it will kick your butt if you're not careful! Two 12-ounce bottles will definitely give you a buzz!

There is a good balance between the sweet caramel and chocolate notes in the flavor and the hop that sticks on my tongue. This is immediately my favorite brown ale to date.

There is a bitterness, but it's not clear whether it is bitter hops or bitter burnt malt; I think both. Major roasted malt. Strong smell, unlike most beers. Tastes much like it smells. Roasted coffee is up front; malt sweetness takes over and is almost too much. Caramel, chocolate as before. I love it. Hops certainly come in at the finish. Finish is hoppy but not mouth puckering; rather dry and comes to an end, leaving your mouth happy but asking for more. Very light bodied. I wish it were just a little heavier.

The taste was really interesting... it was very sweet and spicy up front, with a sour fruit tang in the middle and a nice, bitter coffee finish.

Chocolate on the nose with some estery hoppiness. The flavor is caramel upfront with roasted coffee beans around the edges. Earthy hops counteract the caramel sweetness. Chocolatyness and floral hops mix with one another the further I go. Strong fruity alcohol bite in the end. The finish is almost acidic like a coffee finish. Alcohol lingers.

3.93,-4.1,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,"had this at the Union Bar and Grill in Newton, MA. This is my favorite brown to date. First off, this brown is a little different from other browns in that it has more character, more flavors going on. It does keep some brown characteristics though, mainly it smooth drinkability, and a little of the burntness, but that is covered by the alcohol at the end. It looks black rather than brown, and has a brown head, which faded, but hung around in a thin layer until the end. I couldnt detect anything in particular about the smell, it was quite faint. The first taste sensations are of woody, mustiness. Followed by flowery hops, and then a sweet alcohol finish. I would like to say this is a blend between an IPA in its hop character (floral not bitter) and a brown for it overall character. Very good. I think Todd Alstrom said it best with "A big yet somewhat humble brown ale, all the flavors and complexities are there but none really want to be dominant.... An impressive brew".","danadeny","Jul 30, 2004"

Has a rather high ABV although not a strong alcohol taste like some stronger beers I have had. No way does this compair to a New Castle. It is far superior to the mass production of that brown ale. I was very pleased with my purchase although the Dogfish head sixers run around $8.00 in CT. Good beer but many others are good and cheaper. Well micro brews at that.

Acceptable lacing, and this offering has a hearty grainy aroma tempered with a bit of hops. Taste is a lightly nutty mouthful of malt, with a balancing amount of hops, which while unusual for a brown, is exactly as advertised on the label. Very smooth, and leaves a slight tinge of alcohol on the tongue. Wish it was a bit heartier in makeup, but a joy to behold nonetheless. One of the more sedate style-breaking ales from Dogfish Head.","ppoitras","Apr 10, 2004"

3.8,-7.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured out of the 12 oz. bottle into the pint glass with reddish brown body with a tan colored 2 inch tall rocky head. Initially the beer had a lot of carbonation streamers which died down shortly taking the head with them. There was quite a bit of lace around the glass. The aroma was very Porter-ish, with tones of dark roasted malt, coffee, and alcohol. The taste was nuttier, sweeter, and drier than a Porter with lots of hop bitterness. There was also a good deal of complexity mid palette with hints of licorice, raisins, rum, and caramel. The aftertaste was very dominated by alcohol. In my opinion this beer defies being shoehorned into any style, with elements of Porter, Barleywine, IPA, and Brown Ale all jumbled together. A very good find at Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga, Tennessee (but Ziggys had it too).","rajendra82","Apr 07, 2004"

There is a definite hop presence through and through this Ale, and it mixes very nicely with the malt background. It has a smokey carmel/coffe flavor throughout the drink, which mixes with both the hop and malt aspects of this beer. While it may seem very heavy upon the first couple of samplings, it comes out balanced and highly drinkable.

The taste is very malty, quite chocolate and toffee sweet, but plenty of balancing hop character keeps it off being cloying. 7.2% ABV is to be found nowhere. The medium body is pretty good and fitting as well. Still, I must say I'd have prefered a more intense aroma. I also found it less and less interesting after each sip, perhaps the balance is not so good after all. It remains stylish and original like any Dogfish, but it's definitely not one of their best.

The taste had more subdued notes of this with a more smokey, oaky notes and dry fruits and a more substantial espresso profile. The hops could be detected only in the good burp afterwards. The alcohol was easier to detect in the nose than in the taste. Except for the more complex profile of an ale yeast this beer reminded me of a decent doppelbock.

But it's not the mammoth, over-the-top flavor that I'm used to from the guys at DFH. Pours very dark brown, just this side of opaque, with a very thin top. The first scent to hit you is a roasty, just slightly nutty malt aroma, but as the beer warms this quickly develops into an herbal, leafy hop boquet. The flavor is very well-rounded -- sweet and malty, a bit reminiscent of hazelnut in the main body, with a assertively hopped finish that lends a nice balance to the beer and leaves a tingly aftertaste on your tongue.

Actually, I guess a 7.2% brown ale is over the top, but you can't taste it. Alcohol is nowhere to be found in the aroma or flavor. The body is a nice clear rubied leather. The cream-colored head is thick and slow to subside. Nice texture. The aroma has a bit of chocolate and toffee, really malty with a slight hop bite underneath. The flavor is the same way, smooth creamy malts, a bit sweet, but the hops are present just enough to cut through the sweetness and leave this a very drinkable but still flavorful brown.

This bad boy is practically bursting with heaps of dark flavors (brown breads, figs, etc). Pretty well hopped (English variety) as well, which adds to the flavor assault and quite roasted, more so then a lot of browns. Has a real warming quality as well as the alcohol creeps into the overall taste.. This is the kind of beer a lot of Non BA's wouldn't like a little bit, and that is not a knock on this beer. It is big and bold.

(The c1999 doesn't exactly inspire confidence either.) I have a feeling it is not brand new; hops are muted, barely noticeable which goes against the beer's description of itself as well as other reviewers. Still tasty, and perhaps more of a traditional brown ale as a result. Sweet and sugary, with some tartness from the brown sugar. Much darker than an average brown ale, looking more like a porter with some faint reddish-brown mud at the edges. Head virtually disappears. Mouthfeel thick and sticky. A nice beer to have after being out in the rain, but mostly I am grumbling about how tough it is to find fresh beer around here. (I settled for this beer of indeterminate age after negging my 1st choice, Brooklyn Brown, of which the freshest sample had a drink by date of 2/02!!! The store had multiple, and older, cases of it too! WTF. And that Budweiser was brand spankin' hot off the truck. Don't worry they are not in BeerFly, they don't deserve to be.

Taste is of bitter burnt malt, hops bitter, and hints of sweet molasses. Flavor is almost a porter flavor. The hop and burnt malt bitter lingers in the mouth. Actually it hits too hard and lingers just a bit too long, and detracts from the flavor and drinkability. Otherwise an enjoyable brew.","far333","May 24, 2003"

It produced a medium tan colored head that was fairly thin about ½ thick, but seemed somewhat sticky. It lasted a good way through the glass and produced a sheety lace a good way down then started to separate into patches near the end. The aromas that came from the glass were of roasted malt, brown sugar, roasted barley grains, some chocolate, dark fruit and some alcohol. More roasted malt and barley as it warmed. The tastes that rolled across my tongue were of roasted barley grains, floral hops, dark malt (slight roast), earth tones, chocolate, nuts, baked brown sugar, light dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol. The flavors seemed to be pretty stable as it warmed, no real flavor took over. It left a roasted grain/hop taste behind on the tongue. Medium bodied. To me, this beer seemed to have sweet notes that wanted to come out but were quickly masked by the roasted flavors. This is a clean beer and well crafted. It is an all around smooth taste.

As the bottle describes there are some aromatic barley coming to play here along with the caramalized brown sugar really smells great in the background of the aroma. Taste is very complex, the Liberty and Goldings are pulling their weight in the bittering department. While each sip the dark roasts, hops, and nice warming bite of alcohol blend together smoother and smoother. Very good beer and getting even better as it warms up a little. Leaves the tongue with a comforting dryness making me yearn for the next sip to let all of the flavors splash over my palate once more. A medium body with nice full mouthfeel to it, carries all of the flavor going on here very well. A beer that is quite enjoyable, I couldn't call it a session beer, but one that I would be willing to partake in on draft.

The Indian Brown has assertive hops which is very important to me, and a great malty, maple syrup flavor. It's sweet, but not too sweet.

This ale was dark brown in the glass, with hints of red coloring along the sides. Thin head, with average retention, dwindling to very little by the end. The smell had roasted qualities with a caramel-like odor. Subtle hops and some spices were also present. A fruity odor also complemented the overall smell. I tasted the strong bitterness at first, but the caramel flavor came through with the roasted qualities. A nice hop presence was overcome by the sweetness of the brown sugar. This was a little too sweet for my taste, and it stuck in my mouth long after the swallow. The medium body had a somewhat creamy mouthfeel...more of what I expected from the brown ale.

As it slowly fades, it leaves behind a layer of film that hints at maltiness in the beer. It also leaves more of a sheeting than a lace on the glass sides. The aroma is nutty, with a quality I can't quite pinpoint. Almost like a chocolate malted milkshake. Very little hops going on there. The flavor is strong on roasted malt, with some very evident chocolate notes. A bit of english walnut slides in as well. Alcohol is very apparent on the finish, as is strong roasted coffee notes. Very flavorful and powerful for a brown. A bit of bitterness is also there, but it seems more like coffee bitterness than hops. The sweetness seems to come from the alcohol, but there is a big malt background to back this beer. It feels very full on the tongue, but not a smooth as some browns.

The taste follows the aroma wonderfully-- chocolate flavors abound, while the roasted sharpness of black patent is held to minimum.  Carob and butterscotch become noticeable as the beer warms.  Hop bitterness supports malt adequately but is not centerstage in this brown ale.  The carbonation is perfect, and when coupled w/ the full body, the mouthfeel is smooth, dextrinous and highly enjoyable.  Finishes with a simple extension of the chocolately malt flavors.

The first tastes to arrive on the scene are the caramel and chocolate sweetness which are quickly subdued into perfect balance by earthy hop flavors.  The beer is incredibly smooth and goes down exceptionally easy, especially when you consider that it is 7.2 %.  There is only the slightest hint of alcohol in the taste of this beer.

Nice hop accents that don't overwhelm.  Like Chinook maybe (just a guess).  This is really an interesting Brown.  At times it tastes like stout and at times it tastes like porter.
