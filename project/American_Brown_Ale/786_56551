3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Saw this one while on vacation down in Nashville, at one time I had tried every beer Point made but I hadn't seen this one before so I had to give it a try. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, 2012 is BLACK in the glass with just hints of ruby-brown at its edges. The head is dense and creamy, mocha in color and leaves nice sticky lacing on the glass. The nose is of dark chocolate, toasty notes, a bit earthy and woody. The flavor has similar characteristics, nutty, roasty, chocolaty and earthy. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy, carbonation is rather docile. Overall, a very drinkable beer and honestly better than I expected. They're better than BMC beer but not usually impressive; this one is probably the best I've had by them yet.","gmfessen","Aug 14, 2010"

4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I tried this beer at the Magic City Brewfest. Then Stevens Point 2012 Black was all most black, could not tell about the head because it was on a 2 oz. sample. It Smells sweet, roasty, Nutty. It taste Sweet nutty and ends bitter. The mouthfeel is about average for the Schwarzbier style.","harpus","Jul 29, 2010"
3.38,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"Not bad for Stevens Point. I picked up a single at Princeton Liquors. The near black beer looked more like a Schwarzbier than a brown ale and tasted like a stronger (and better crafted) version of Yuengling Porter. It had the fruity dark chocolate flavor of a classic Baltic Porter, but then had a noticeably thin body that gave away the quasi-craft origins. The flavor dropped off pretty quickly, but what was there was quite pleasant.","tempest","Jul 25, 2010"
3.45,-3.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a small dark tan head. I have seen porters and stouts lighter in color that this! Smell is a hint of coffee beans, and dried fruit. Taste is dry cocoa powder up front, with a tart malt middle, and an earthy, grassy finish. Mouthfeel is average, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, rather light bodied for 5.4 percent alcohol. This is an enjoyable beer, but with so many better, similar beers, I doubt I will be buying this again.","tronester","Jul 21, 2010"
3.58,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is toffee with some chocolate and earthy hops notes. The flavor is toffee and earthy hops with not too much else going on. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a very exciting beer, but nothing too offensive either.","Mora2000","Jul 04, 2010"
3.34,-6.2,4.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Easy to drink and fairly light bodied like a Schwarzbier, hints of roast malt and coffee, flaccid and husky with slight diacetyl. Not particularly complex, but its not bad. Could drink 1-2 easily.","emerge077","Jun 27, 2010"
2.97,-16.6,3.5,4,3,2,2,"Overall, it drinkability is about average. The aftertaste does not leave you wanting more. But the beer is worth a try, and it is nice to see this long time brewery pushing its limits and trying new styles.","DrinkinBoy","Jun 25, 2010"

3.78,6.2,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"This ale pours black with a moderate, but quickly diminishing tan head with a little lace. The aroma is moderately roasty with subtle caramel and bready malts. The flavor is moderate-high malt -- mainly nutty and chocolate with some roast and finishes dry. Nothing overly complex, but still tasty. The hop bitterness is medium-low, accented by the dry finish. The hop flavor is low but noticeable, slightly spicy. The carbonation is moderate and body medium-thin. Overall a flavorful ale with great drinkability.","uwmgdman","Jun 20, 2010"

4.05,13.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"D - I could see drinking a six pack of this quite easily. It's not the best dark beer I've ever had but it's decent enough and would do well for someone in the mood for a stout but not in the mood for the mouthfeel.","Yojimbo1941","May 27, 2010"

3.85,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly viscous dark brown from the bottle, and about a 1/2" of tan head arises and quickly fades. Aroma is sweet and malty. In the flavor I get quite a bit of roasty coffee and slight chocolate/toffee notes. Mouthfeel is good - nice and smooth. A very easy-drinking ale. I like.","tim9887","Apr 28, 2010"

3.13,-12.1,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Aroma is malty with a subtle undertone of molasses and a whisper of yeast. It pours a nice opaque sable with a fairly thick and fluffy beige head. Flavor is malty and a little sweet, having a hint of molasses, but not too strong. Texture is a little on the watery side and just a little fizzy.","Cyberkedi","Mar 25, 2010"
3.73,4.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall, this beer is very drinkable. It is like a combination of light and dark beers with reasonable components of each making it pleasant, refreshing and worth a trial if you can get it.","SykDoc","Mar 08, 2010"
3.71,4.2,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Drinks pretty easy, not on "point" for the style, but close enough. Far better than most offerings from these guys. I look as this a pretty solid release from these guys & worthy of future purchases when hankering for some coffee/ licorice flavor, especially for the price","russpowell","Mar 03, 2010"
3.9,9.6,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"This brew was a deep dark chocolate brown color with a nice light brown 2 finger head. The aroma was strong of roasted malts, deep chocolate, mild coffee, and some subtle nuttiness. The taste was right on track with the aroma. Strong roasted malt presence with coffee and chocolate tones. There was a wonderful hop balance to this brew and the thick and creamy head went well with the moderate carbonation. This was a tasty treat after a 5 mile run! Very surprised with this brew and am happy to have it brewed in my backyard!","WJVII","Beers"
3.51,-1.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4," ~ This beer isn't going to change the world but it will make Stevens Point Brewery a bit more diverse. I think this beer was created for the purpose of giving us Point Beer faithful a nice, sessionable, dark, ale. I appreciate what Point is doing here and I will definitely support their efforts. I suggest you do the same.","cdkrenz","0"
