A fingernail of off white to light beige foam covers the vast majority of the top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of chocolate, hazelnut and dark malt.  The flavor is muted than the nose would indicate.  It is mostly dark malt and hazelnut.  I do detect a hint of the sweet bourbon in the aftertaste.

3.74,0.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"this is better than its ratings. people should know, that according to the label only a portion of this beer was actually aged in bourbon barrels, then blended in, so its intentionally subtle, and i for one like and respect that approach to this. its got all the vanilla and bourbon character you could want in the finish, but it doesnt dominate the whole experience. it lets all the chocolate malt and a hint of coconut come out. lighter in color than expected, it is indeed a brown, not anything darker, and the roast profile is moderate at best. i like its lightness though, and think it shows another side of the bourbon barrel thing, which is the complimentary flavors of the spirit and the chocolate malt. its so often lost to the oak itself or the heavy roast or the alcohol content, and i think this beer does a nice job with all elements together. a little more body would be alright by my, but the carbonation is nice and the finish is appropriately long and mellow. its a little something different, and i like that.","StonedTrippin","Oct 26, 2014"

I catch some barley malt, chocolate malt, creamy coconut, vanilla and brownie batter. The flavor is light and the feel a bit thin but it tastes quite good. Coconut is prominent with chocolate malts, brownie, light vanilla, butterscotch and an oak wood. Not a bad choice when looking for a cheaper barrel aged beer.","KYGunner","Sep 13, 2014"

Aroma smells mildly of brown sugar and milk chocolate, with a touch of alcoholic heat. The flavor is a blend of both caramel and roasted malt, with a solid hop presence and a noticeable oaky, bourbon accent. The sweetness is most present up front before being subdued by the hops. The bourbon presents most prominently in the finish. Some black coffee can be detected as well. This beer has a number of elements working for it as far as the taste is concerned, but the downside is there is not a great deal of cohesiveness, as each aspect appears to assert itself in sequence as opposed to in a balanced blend. The carbonation may be a shade too prickly as well. Don't get me wrong, as this is still a very drinkable brown ale, but it lacks some polish that could elevate it to the next level.","MaximalC","Oct 31, 2012"

The aroma is fairly common for a brown ale, with a lightly sweet and nutty malt base, some light milk chocolate characteristics, and only a slightest hint of the bourbon addition. The flavor is largely more of the same, but the bourbon contribution is much greater, especially as the beer warms, with a woodsy, smokey whiskey character that creeps into the flavor at first before overtaking the finish. The texture is a bit thin and watery and doesn't prop up the flavors like it should. Overall, this one is a pleasant, mild brown ale with a bit of a twist that is interesting enough to make you want to try it the first time, but it is not so interesting to want go back again often.","devilben02","Feb 21, 2012"

The nose comprises oak, bourbon, dark wheat, and some watered-down roasted malts, with a kick of alcohol looming in the background. The taste lightens the bourbon, adds a healthy helping of walnuts and greens, and continues the watering-down of the roasted malts. The body is medium, with a light carbonation and a liquid-y feel.

There's some chocolate notes, too, most definitely, but none of the coffee-like tones of a porter. It's sweet and malty, but, like, heavy, man.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but there is a little bit of a woody/oak taste too. But with a beer that's partially aged in bourbon barrels, I expected more bourbon to be noticable in both the aroma and taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK enough.

Flavor is amazingly smooth, with a surprising amount of vanilla-inflected bourbon coming through. Herbal bitterness cleans away any residual sweetness on the finish. More and more malt sweetness that again follows the caramelized, nearly burnt sugar notes form the aroma becomes more evident with subsequent sips. Mouthfeel is a bit thin; a slightly heavier body would enhance the experience. This has the components of a big beer in a slightly smaller format. Drinkability is OK.

While my score isn't too high, this is a really nice example of two styles that I normally dislike: small bourbon barrel-aged beer in normal styles and brown ales. My main criticism of the beer is only that it's all a bit mild, which is definitely unexpected. The brown ale is fairly nutty and spicy. It has a big, sweet malty backbone. I wouldn't want one every night, but it's good stuff. The bourbon barrel aging has been done with a light touch. Within its specifications on paper, I'm not sure that I would change anything. It just doesn't amount to enough for a higher score.","popery","Jul 22, 2009"

The aroma is great with a ton of dark fruits, raisins and grapes, and molasses on top of malt base. The bourbon is definitely present as well in the nose. The taste doesn't quite live up to the nose for me and tastes a little bit like a grape soda mixed with tea with the huge sweetness of the dark fruits. The first taste is is of sweet malts and nuts up front before giving way to the fruity sweetness and a slight bourbon burn through the finish.

3.97,6.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Without having a lot of Boubon aged Brown ales, I always thought this would be a very good idea. This beer is a good example of why. The beer looks... ...well, brown, with some ruby highlights mixed in, and a slight haze. Low levels of carbon dioxide release a dainty foamstand, that did last the duration and laced well up front. The aromas give a solid chocolate malt scent with some emphasis on sweetness in the range of caramel, vanilla, and a little lactose. Tastes give much the same with a higher emhasis on the vanilla notes. A mild wood flavor eminatats through the sweetness and balances well with the timid hops and toasted grains. Any boubon flavors remain light and come through late in the finish / aftertaste. The body feels a bit heavy (due to lighter co2), but offers a velvety, milky texture. A really good beer, on the verge of being great. Thanks again Nathan15.","BEERchitect","Oct 01, 2007"

A creamy mouthfeel leads to a thin-flavored wash of syrupy flavor of sweet malt and caramel, and definite bourbon overtones. Although I think the bourbon detracts.
