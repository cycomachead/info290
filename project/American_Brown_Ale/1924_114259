Taste is that of a very typical brown ale though.  Nothing really noteworthy here and a quite bitter finish as well along with some burnt roasty notes.  Body and mouthfeel is quite thin.  Overall, this is just a very pedestrian brown ale and not the most enjoyable.  Good but nothing really making me want to revisit.","bubseymour","Jan 04, 2015"

The flavor is interesting, reminds me of the old sno ball cake by hostess, which I was not a fan of.  There is also an off taste on the finish that does not seem like a bitter.

4,9,,,,,,"Overall: Really interesting right up front. Great coconut, toasted coconut, and caramel/fudge flavors. Balanced and drinkable. Additionally, I think this would make a great dessert beer, and it would probably make for some great, unusual and unexpected food pairings. For straight-forward drinkability, however, the coconut ultimately becomes the main component, overshadowing the base malts, and it's not really compelling enough to want a second within any given session.","NeroFiddled","Nov 16, 2014"

3.54,-3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.25," The taste has a good amount of freshly roasted coconut with a supporting taste of cocoa/caramel and malt with a more toasted but not bready flavor. Overall this is a nice brown if you enjoy coconut. The flavor is pretty much dominated by the adjuncts which is fine if that is how you roll - I would prefer those flavors simply compliment the base beer instead of overwhelming it -I won't order this again.","Slatetank","Apr 08, 2014"
