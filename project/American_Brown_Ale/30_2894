3.8,-2.3,,,,,,"Very good balanced beer, one downside is the head retention, the tan head disappears quickly. The ale makes up for it with a taste that lingers long after the mouth feel disappears, bringing once forward nut flavors to the back of the tongue. Semi spicy hops with nice dark floral tones that really compliment the medium malt tastes. Could have a fuller body for a brown ale, but seems like the mouth feel of many american brown ales. Traditional english browns are deeper on the malt but this one still carries through a lot of the flavors you come to expect from an old school brown but with stronger emphasis on the raisen tones throughout, both in the aroma and taste.","Mc808","Dec 13, 2014"

There's just enough light passing through to make out some tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malt, chocolate, and coffee. It also smells a little nutty. With the taste, I pick up the roasted malt very strongly with some accompanying sweetness. I also detect the chocolate, coffee, and nutty flavors I found in the aroma. The body is medium with plentiful carbonation. The beer is smooth and highly drinkable. This is an excellent beer.

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Good brown ale - can definitely taste the darker malts. Didn't have much head but was adequately carbonated. Also had in a can and didn't enjoy it as much as there was too much carbonation in the can and but couldn't realize the full taste until it warmed up a bit (which of course is more drinker's error). Would drink again, but would drink out of the bottle or glass.","hopley","Apr 14, 2012"

4.32,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Picked up a six pack of cans from GBX as a flyer. Had never tried this before and always looking from new Browns. Got home and poured into a snifter. Beautiful mahogany and medium brown with a generous head and good lacing and spotting. Smell was a surprise. Carmel and nuts took over the aroma and it was a nice blend of the two. Perhaps some brown sugar on the end as well. Taste was what really caught my attention. Very smooth blend of malts and hops. Like the carmel mixing with the hops to give a little complexity to this brew. Feel was a little heavy carbonation, but not over the top. More toward the thick end for me. Overall- A very nice surprise. Sessionable brown with tons of flavor and a great blend. Avery got this right and it's growing on me. A very solid Brown that will find it's way into regular rotation-","TheDinger","Apr 07, 2012"

Despite the heavy carbonation, the beer holds up. Lingering nutty and tannic finish with drying bitter cocoa flavors.

3.58,-8,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Ellie's Brown Ale brew pours a deep, dark brown with a minimal light tan head, that provides some decent lace throughout. Sweet malt aromas dominate, with hints of caramel and chocolate very noticeable. The sweet maltiness in the nose is also present in the flavor, with the pallet being able to pick up some brown sugar, light vanilla, and some nuttiness, in addition to stronger chocolate and caramel favors. Lighter amounts of carbonation help make this medium bodied ale smooth and creamy. A GREAT Colorado example of a classic.","phishsihq","Feb 29, 2012"
3.65,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served on-tap in a tumbler pint, the beer is a light, clear, chestnut highlighted brown coloring with a foamy, frothy, light tan head. Good head retention with a solid cling while you drink. Aromas are light coffee, cream, and nutty highlights with a toffee sweetness throughout. Flavors are smooth and super easy to drink, with a nutty, creamy backbone that is similar to peanut butter, with some fruity sweet highlights. Roasted characteristics bring the beer back down to a close, leading to a slightly sweet, nutty aftertaste. The finish is kept light and somewhat crisp by the carbonation levels, but still manages to give off a slight filmy linger on the roof of the mouth.","GarthDanielson","Feb 28, 2012"

Let's see if it still holds such a rank: It pours a clear ruby-sienna topped by a finger of wan ecru foam. The nose is a blast of caramel, with maybe tiny corpuscles of mild cocoa and lightly toasted biscuit floating in the deep background. The taste brings in more of the same, though some roast does indeed make it through at times, even if only at Tebow-level consistency. There's some light buttered-biscuit and dark greens notes in there as well, but they also constitute tiny minorities. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brown, nothing overtly special, but something eminently drinkable and enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Jan 17, 2012"

4.13,6.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall I thought that this was pretty damn good American Brown Ale. It had a pretty nice malt profile to it and the extra nuttiness in this beer was pretty good, it was so nutty that I think it should be called Ellie's Nut Brown Ale. This beer had very good drinkability for an American Brown Ale, it went down really smooth, had a good mouthfeel, and it had enough flavor to keep me wanting to drink it. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and the mouthfeel, the malt profile was dead on for an American Brown Ale, and I really like the extra nuttiness in this beer and the mouthfeel was right where it should be. There wasn't really anything I didn't like about this beer, no complaints here. I will buy this beer again, the extra nuttiness makes this a good beer for late fall or early winter. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Brown Ales, and if you like them nutty then you will really like this beer. So far I have been pretty impressed with the beers that Avery puts in cans, they have all been pretty exceptional for their style. I am having a fun time checking out Avery's beers, I just picked up a bottle of their quad so I hope it is just as impressive as this beer is.

3.95,1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"as good a brown as ive had anywhere. pours a translucent dark copper color with a gorgeous head lacing the glass every sip. smells malty and robust, but not that english newcastle type of way. its a more textured laid back malt profile, with notes of vanilla and molasses in the finish. body is just a bit thin for me here, my only critique of an excellent beer. carbonation is perfect and the finish is great, slow and a little smokey even. resonant and memorable, this is a well made beer, perfect with a grilled duck breast and cabbage","StonedTrippin","Nov 06, 2011"

A nice roasty flavor lingers on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly but smooth mouthfeel.

Smell is all chocolate with some English hops (I guessed Goldings, but the their website states Bullion, Cascade and Fuggles). Taste is roasty chocolate with a nice amount of sweetness that ends semi dry. Carb is mild giving it a creamy quality. At this time I'd say it's probably my second favorite American Brown.

Taste of huge caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, nutmeg, vanilla, molasses, and a bit of citrus. Small amount of bitterness present on the finish that lingers with caramel, chocolate, and light citrus flavor. Medium carbonation and body. Very nice and creamy mouthfeel with maximum drinkability.

Not quite as alluring as the nose lets on, but still quite good.

The flavor is slightly more substantial, but still not dense, with a pleasant combination of light caramel, candied cashews, and a bit of mossy hops and smoldering firewood to balance. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but that does help this one go down even easier.

The nose was immediately rich with vanilla notes and leaning in, I also got milk chocolate and an almond nuttiness. Was I drinking a beer or having a dessert? Mouthfeel was medium, but on the upper end, approaching creaminess. Lots of flavors going on in the mouth, but you had better like sweets. I got got milk chocolate, almonds or peCANs, and even a light smokiness. Fantastic! Finish was somewhat on the sweet side for my taste, but there was nothing wrong with it stylistically.

Ended up with a good 2 finger or so head, tan in color on the very dark brown beer. The head was slow to dissipate, and the lacing stuck around for a while. Smells nice and thick, with a caramel hint and what I would call more cocoa than chocolate. It has a deep malty taste and the cocoa really stays with you throughout, with the beer almost clinging to the sides of your mouth. Not bad, but a little strong with the cocoa. I've had other brown ales that I would prefer over this, though it isn't one I would push away. Call it an average brown ale from my standpoint.","FrankenBeerStein","Apr 27, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, and subtle wheat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this wasn't too bad of a Brown Ale. The bitterness and sweetness in this one were quite well balanced. With that, this was not the best Brown I've had but still pretty good.

Taste is more of the same - a little bit of roasted malt, with a good bit of hazelnut and some chocolate malt, too. Hop bitterness provides balance to the malt sweetness, and nothing more - nothing too crazy going on, hop-wise. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and smooth... very drinkable.

Taste includes some toasty malt character with a flavor a bit like toffee and some notes of a seemingly musty coffee. A bit of citrus hops are on the back with a slight bitterness that lingers with a noticeable amount of alcohol character for less than 6%.

I have to agree with the Bros- I'm not sure what's up with browns and dog references on the label...it's a bit tiresome at this point. But, I will definitely forgive this "lab-tested" brew since it is very tasty. Very easy drinking and definitely a solid brown ale. Will be having this one again without a doubt, although it is not widely available in Chicagoland. Received this as part of a mixed 12 pack from World Market if I'm not mistaken. On another note, this would be a good stepping stone for a novice beer lover. Newcastle or the like for starters, then something like this, and then on to some serious brown ales! Hey Avery, how about a bourbon barrel variation? (which could exist and I'm ignorant to its existence!)","stangski83","Jan 24, 2010"

A smooth, almost creamy medium-bodied beer with caramel and hints of chocolate malts along with a touch of bread malt that not only lets the beer be sweet but balances it out and gives it a slightly dry backbite.

Real nice malt aroma here, solid chocolate aroma comes out, sweet as well, roasted, slightly nutty. Wow, at first I can see why this brew is listed as one of the better Brown Ales, simply fantastic malt flavor. Very similar to what we saw in the aroma, chocolate flavor at first then a caramel like finish. Some nut like flavors seem to poke through. Slight hop presence at the later half that is nice and goes along real well with the malts. The only detractor that I have on this one as I am nearing the end of it the sweetness or chocolate just seem to be turning me a bit.

3.63,-6.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear brown coloration with an amber tinge, above average clarity for the hue, the head a good 1-2 fingers deep at first with a steady dissipation thereafter. Roasted coffee beans, heavy cream and raw dough and nuts blossom first in the nose, while the toastiness of malts seem in charge, the more bitter hops quietly insinuate themselves into the arena, unrolls slowly as you sniff. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation noticeably roils things up from the first sip and gets them flowing. Caramel, coffee bean, vanilla, pecans and brown sugar don't become too sweet for this reason, in turn this also permits the hops to blend grain, oat and mineral water accents into the mix. Does thin out at the end, however, this fits with the overall mouth feel. Requires a touch more decisiveness.","farrago","Jan 17, 2009"

The taste is a bit darker than most brown ales I've had, but I was expecting it based on the smell. Chocolate roasted malts up front, combined with the flavor of sweet (but not too sweet) nuts, which finished off with a ligh sweetness from brown sugar and toffee and even a very faint hop bite.

3.98,2.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"So here I have another one of the lesser regular lineup Avery brews that I had not had the pleasure of trying yet. I was thrilled to pick up an entire mixed case when I was up in Knoxville of a lot of the brew I cannot get down here. This being one of them. This poured a great caramel color brown with just enough light getting through to give it a sort of off reddish tint. The smallish tan head quickly faded and left behind only traces of itself. The aroma itself was lightly smoked almost, full of roasted malts and a touch of caramel. The flavor was light bodied but nicely roasted with a touch of a bittering finish and a flavor full of earthy grain like tones. A nice subtle bread like base was quaintly masked underneath. Overall this was a decent brown ale. It was nothing spectacular, but I do not think it was designed to be, but rather it was a very nice interpretation of the style. I could see myself drinking this on a session basis as it was very nice and very full of flavor without being too heavy or filling. A quality sessionable brown ale is what it should be and it definitely succeeds at that.","mikesgroove","Nov 20, 2007"
3.8,-2.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Ellie's Brown Ale is good all around, a solid and tasty, if unspectacular, contribution from Avery. The head was thin but durably frothy atop a medium brown body, nice. The aromas were full of chocolate, with a modicum of coffee and caramel, all of which appeared in the taste. I must add, though, that while I enjoyed the firm malty taste, the flavors didn't deliver as much in taste as they did in smell, to my disappointment. It's a fine, smooth brown ale, just not one that knocked my socks off. Overall, worth picking up and a good, smooth brown. A solid brown ale, but apparently not everything that Avery produces is five stars. Still, Avery has provided a sturdy, smooth brown ale worth the effort. Kudos.","Gehrig","Nov 17, 2007"

There are bits of cherry in the taste and maybe a bit of orange zest too? This was slightly syrupy feelings with a medium body and a crisp, dry finish. Great taste and very smooth.

The aroma is a little on the lighter side, with sweet dark malts and dark chocolate present. I found the flavor to be quite nice: it tasted of caramel and chocolate, with some dark maltiness and nuts as well. My only complaint is there was a definite metallic edge to the flavor, and that stunted the smoothness that I prefer some from brown ales. The texture was good, but a little too much carbonation for my taste. All in all, it's quite good, but there are some I may prefer.

Smell is fairly bland without much character. Aroma is of mild malt with a soapy smell that I typically associate with a pils. Taste is good and malty with a faint hint of bitterness; typical for the style. Mouthfeel is warming with a bite owing to the carbonation. However, this effect flattens out after a few minutes and the beer becomes more mellow. Very easy to drink with a flavor that improves as the beer is consumed.

Oddly, I've been finding in the finish, what tastes like wet dog smells. Weird, but not too strong or off-putting. Mouthfeel sits between light and moderate. Carbonation is adequate.

Excellent retention all the way down, leaving rings and lace on the glass. I don't think the nose is all that, despite Todd's rave. I get molasses, toasted and roasted malts, and that's about it. The flavors, though, are wonderful. Definately chocolate biscuits up front, roasted malts throughout, slight hops for balance, and a rasiny finish. I think it's a distinct and very flavorful brew.

The aroma is chocolaty, a little bit of roast, a little nutty, and some caramel sweetness. The flavor is a lot like the aroma. There is a light roasted character as well as elements of smokiness and chocolate. The hop bitterness is low, but combined with a bit of bitterness from roasted grains, the impression compliments the grain bill perfectly. The carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel/body is medium.

Faint malt and chocolate aromas permeate, but nothing jumps out and grabs you. The taste is nutty. A bit too carbonated here, but it does settle down a bit and mellow out. Notes of chocolate, coffee, and black cherry exist as well. Nice coffee bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is solid enough. Overall, it's a pleasant beer. A worthy session beer for sure.

The mouthfeel was nice and solid and not watery like others in the style. The taste was really good with a good balance of the roasted malts. Overall, I really enjoy this beer and find myself getting a 6ixer every few months. It's not a complex beer and doesn't stretch any of the 5 categories above but just really hits the spot.

Aromas are principally grainy, very toasty and showing little fruit. On the palate, very bready first off (reminds me of the breadsticks you used to get at faux-high end restaurants), then a bit of English ale sourness before finishing dry.

I approve of this but only wish that the taste was more in the body than in the aftertaste. It comes across as a medium Lite Dark as opposed to the black tartar morass that I am and crave more of.

Initially, the aromas and flavors are promising; beginning with a solid, but medium malt, nutty, and lightly chocolatey character.

Some small amounts of caramel, nice bit of walnut, a hint of berries, and subdued hops that still stick out slightly at the back end.

Smells chocolate and toffee with a gentle floral hop. Tastes nutty, chocolate, toffee, and a volatile hop flavor (tastes cottony and sorta like Fuggles and sorta like First Gold). The hops are not tremendously bitter, but they have a potent grassy co-humulone character that contrasts with the sweet of the chocolate nicely. This beer is not tremendously complex, but the flavors that are present are well-balanced and cooperate well. Medium to med-light body with moderate carbonation. There's still a thin layer of head over the liquid and the lacing on the inside of the glass is stupendous.","mentor","Jul 15, 2005"

Being and English style I suppose it's supposed to be a little mild though, but I think I was expecting a bit more. A decent murky brown color, little head. Smell is a tad hoppy for a brown ale and has hints of chocolate, roasted malts, but nothing really unusual or particularly intriguing. Taste is much the same, light and hoppy, and not as malty and roasty as your traditional brown ale. Almost like a simple APA with some toasted malt thrown in, not really a brown ale. Like I said, the mouthfeel was a little thin, which I usually like but in this beer something was lacking. Drinkable beer though. Not bad, don't get me wrong, but I was expecting a bit more.

3.8,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Clear, ruby-brown in hue with a slight tawny influence, it is a lovely color, very shiny. It is too bad there isnt any noticeable animation to liven up the liquid or replenish the head. The foam reached about a half finger in height, the beige bubbles collapsed quickly to a soapy cap. Subsequent lacing was spotty and unorganized; it looks respectable in my glass. The nose is malty with pleasant chocolate undertones, sweet buttery notes. Potency is modest, there is good malty depth, I wish there was some hops in the nose. I couldnt find any. The nose is too fatty for me; I like my Brown Ales to be sharper. The nose is decent; it is inviting, just not noteworthy. It makes me want to take a sip; Im just not rushed. I love Brown Ales and this one is good. The palate is malty with depth that fits the style; chocolate malts, very weak hints of coffee beans, flashes of toasted bread. The sweetness plays much nicer than the nose indicated. Flashes of heat are oddly enjoyable if not misplaced; it acts nicely towards some nuttiness. Noticeable spicy hops find a home near the end, only to be interrupted by a dry, chalky cocoa powder-like taste. Modest bitterness. The finish could be stronger, more organized. I dont want to say this beer falls apart because it doesnt; it just fades a bit. Dry, astringent aftertaste. Overall the palate is good, it is tasty enough for me to consider drinking this again. Ive had better, so what it is good at the moment. Around medium in body, the carbonation is moderately low but workable and the mouthfeel is slick. Id drink this again with cheese and crackers. This is a decent Brown Ale, drinkable but not groundbreaking. Still no complaints from this simplistic offering from Avery, my lone bottle was purchased in Brookfield, WI. Try one.","bditty187","Nov 19, 2004"

Smell is more roasted malt than expected, some raisin and fig, and some cocoa. Seems more like a dark ale just from the aroma. Flavor is also less sweet than expected for a brown ale, more caramel and toasted malt. Also some fig, a bit of molasses, and a hint of bitter chocolate. Hope profile is low, very understated. Very full and smooth mouthfeel, which I'm noticing consistenly from the Avery beers. Not sure if I would consider this typical of the English brown ale style, but it's very tasty. Thanks to Brent.","far333","Sep 28, 2004"
3.61,-7.2,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"A deep red pour from the tap, with a full inch tan head that laced decently, if not great. The smell is nothing to note. It smells like beer. Slightly malty, no hop aroma. The malts dominate the taste. Chocolate comes to the front, and stays the entire way through. Smooth, but with the acidness that you expect from a brown ale. The chocolate coats the tongue, and you relly taste this at the back of you mouth, taking away from the beer.","TheJudge","Sep 28, 2004"

It goes down smooth and finishes creamy, yet dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking brown ale.

Malty nose, medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Notes of sweet, smooth malt, nutty. caramel, honey. A slight bitterness picked up late. Classy brown ale, Avery knows what they are doing and it shows with this fine take on the style. Subtle, refined and suprisingly complex.

Tangy toffee and chocolate up front. It then sours a little and thick, buttery chocolate emerges. A hoppy bitter finish sports roasted nuts. It's tangy. A good, intense, chocolatey, hoppy brown.","kbub6f","Jul 05, 2004"

A delightful (although slightly too thin) head graced the glass, then slowly disappared leaving lots of lacing. Smells faintly of sweet malts. The taste is quite good. Sweet malty flavor balanced by some bittering hops that come in more towards the end. Finishes dry with some lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I would like for such a dark beer, but definitely not unpleasant. This is a highly drinkable beer that I would gladly have again and again.

The aroma has a sweet and buttery nuttiness about it with hints of chocolate and licorice. Very alluring and soft. The taste is mildly roasty and full of all sorts of rich and nutty flavors.

Now it seemed to be a fair representation of its style, which is not a style that I am overly fond of, but I found the beer lacking in both mouthfeel and taste. the beer seemed thin with not much foam or glass lacing. taste of burned malt very strong and I felt also a bit overhwhelming and not subtle enough for my taste. Would be a fine session beer, but again this style is generally not to my preference. thought that color and clarity were both quite good.","sublimesipping","Apr 24, 2004"

Nothing spectacular, but everything you would expect and not be disappointed by. The taste is similarly malty, slightly smoky with a bit of chocolate flavor but not overly sweet, good brown ale stuff. The nice medium body and good level of carbonation compliment each other nicely and make this a very drinkable brown.

Its aroma is of toasted malt and chocolate. It has a nice smoth and creamy mouthfeel. The taste is big on malts (which I like). It starts with nutty, toasted malts and a touch of caramel, and has a subdued bitter finish which balances the beer nicely. Overall, a wonderful brown that is very drinkable.

Pleasant aromas consists of chocolate & caramel malts and roasted nut. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Very satisfying flavors of toasted malt, caramel, bittersweet chocolate flow over the palate. Finishes has a lingering nutty dryness to it. It's only detraction seems that the finish seems to flatten out a bit. Something in the initial taste gets lost at the end. Maybe it's the sweetness that fades out or something.

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Now this is a great beer, I can say that after one look, sniff, and taste that this beer is one I would love to have at my reaches whenever I wanted. Pours deep amber brown hue with a nicely formed moccha tan head leaves full collar of lacing great mix of speckled lacing from the side I have been sipping from while the opposite side has a bar about an inch wide of coated bubbles clinging on my pint. Aroma: Chocolate malts are evident a nutty appeal is also present along with a soothing current of mild hopping, but I will say the soft chocolate tones is what sold me on this beer much like some mindless drones can be sold by the dropp eyed lab on the label I assume it's Ellie. Taste: Cap says small brewery - BIG BEERS yep that's about right not a huge west coast hoppy big but very flavorful and fulfilling. Tasty chocolate splashes the palate followed by a very nice dose of bittering hops that blend so well together the toasted malts bring out mild hints of coffee and nuts pretty damn good. Mouthfeel: Medium body solid brew can't complain nothing bad to say very smooth and drinkable brown ale.

3.55,-8.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Ellies Brown Ale is one of the more English Brown Ales out there, IMO, even with the use of Bullions and Cascades. The clear, deep ruby body is topped by a thin, almost splotchy head of beige, lacing head. The aroma of sweet, chocolate and crystal malts mingle with the coolness of American hops and the Fuggles. Between the chocolate malts and the Fuggles, the medium body is very earthy, after the initial sweetness. Then an almost piney coolness almost mitigates the maltiness. The two opposing flavors linger momentarily in equilibrium, but the earthy maltiness wins out and the beer sours ever so slightly in the finish due to the imbalance and the resulting, left-over sugar. A solid offering, but by Avery standards, this ones a bit weak and uninteresting","TXHops","Jun 27, 2003"

Ambrosial start, lots of malt, the top skimpy in feel with the finish having a delightful hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate and the aftertaste droughty and long lasting.

It very slowly fades to a rocky layer of foam that you must suck the beer through. It leaves about a quarter-inch collar of foam at the top of the glass. For those of us with mustaches, the head wants to collect on the upper lip. The aroma is sweet caramel and a hint of chocolate, with just a touch of hops showing through. The taste is mild and sweet. Chocolate covered caramel and some nice maltiness, followed by a touch of bitterness. A very light sourness creeps in on the finish, but it cleans up the palate very well and prevents the sweetness from hanging around. The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated and a tad thin. Drinkability is excellent. If they could just create a little more body for this beer, it would be a real gem.

Fairly light mouthfeel that's just about right for an American brown ale, but the smell and taste -- hops galore!  Almost as much as their IPA, my first experience with Avery (and one which rated far better).
