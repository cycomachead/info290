Semi bitter finish medium to light bodied nothing cloying or holding me back from another drink gravity did all the work, damn where did the beer go...drinkability is insane I want a whole four pack.

The transition between the malts up front and hops in the back is a bit weird, and really the only downside to the flavor combination. It was a really smart move by Sixpoint to release this when they did, as the beer is a great segue from lighter, refreshing summer beers to the Märzens/Oktoberfests and pumpkin ales of the fall.","BeerNotes","Apr 21, 2013"

The nose comprises honey-laden biscuit, light maple syrup, mild grass, light walnut, and a hint of incredibly vague citrus rind way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of grass, a slightly stronger contingent of citrus, and a dried version of the honey and syrup. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

Aromas of hazelnut sweetness, with a creamy undertone. The nose is not overpowering, but it is inviting. Flavors are very rich and extremely roasty. Wow...the aromas lull you into a false sense of passiveness, and then you get a fire-roasted nut sweetness and richness, followed by sharp characteristics from both the thin, carbonated body as well as the lingering charcoal highlights. Some candied sweet characteristics build slowly as you continue to drink, but the rich and roasty carry you through the whole brew. The body is light, and remains able to support the robust flavors. Slick, clean finish with only the slightest short-lived linger of sweet. Solid brown.","GarthDanielson","Jan 29, 2013"

Hazy brown liquid with a strong orange influence, almost looks like rusty water, very active carbonation throughout. The nose does a good job of creating an even spit between sweeter chocolate, toffee crunch, cola bean notes and an earthier, grassier hop presence, almost metallic or minerally at times, nothing here has too much cutting punch to it while also stays firm, maybe could soak in a bit more for added length. Medium-bodied, comes on quickly with carbonated churn in the mouth which likely keeps it drying than otherwise might be. So-so richness to the cocoa, malt, caramel, coffee bean flavors, not a lot of roast but there is decent yeastiness in a dry powder form. Less earthy and minerally here, about same level of herbaceousness with a run up in pine and grapefruit pith. No real fruit flavors. Curiously, sweeter colder than as it warms.

Taste starts with some roasted malt character which I barely picked up on the nose. Some crusty bread comes in with a touch of caramel character. The taste finishes with a hop note.

Color was a reddish-brown with NE-quality clarity, but not deep enough in its shade to be called mahogany. Nose had a real hop presence to it, very pine-y, underlain by a slight malty sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops really presented up front, followed by a light chocolaty sweetness on the tongue.

Bitter dark chocolate shows up in the flavor as well, but some nuttiness adds a bit of malt complexity that the nose was lacking. The bitterness that comes through next is definitely on the restrained side. The hop finish is much more bold, with lots of herb and spice flavors showing up. The body is just a bit on the dry side for a brown ale, especially given that it's paired with a mildly assertive carbonation.

The malts in themselves were complex and dry, but we wished they were a bit more potent in both the nose and the flavoring.

A floral hop aroma with a backbone of toasty malt. Flavor puts the toasted malts in front but it's also nicely hopped and grassy as Sixpoint beers tend to be. Creamy mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. Medium long finish with a solid blend of the hops and malt as it fades.

Touches of caramel as well as a light tobacco touch to it. Really huge brown ale here. Smooth, mellow carbonation, rich, creamy profile with each sip having to be savored time, and time again.

Roasted malt, toffee and spicy herbal hop aromas, a bit smokey. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. This didn't seem to fit any specific style guideline, but it was like a cross between an esb and brown ale. Roasted malt and toffee flavors up front with spicy herbal hops being added through the middle and to the end. Roasted malt flavors transition to coffee at the finish which is fairly dry.

Taste is a bit more clean with a blend of carmel, chocolate, butterscotch, light molasses, brown sugar and damp earth, notes of dark roasted nuts and coffee.

Appearance is standard for a brown ale; deep mahogany, with a thin tan head, and fair lacing. The smell yielded notes of roasted malt, coffee, cocoa powder, toffee, and piney hops. The flavor was amazing; first the malty/sweetness hits you, then the hop essence blends in, and then it finishes with a roasted nut flavor that is not overpowering. I even detected the piney hops in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel, in my mind, was the best part...this was a medium-bodied brown ale, that felt adequately carbonated, easy on the palate, and VERY drinkable. The only sessionable brown ale that I've ever come across. I've butted heads with some friends over some of Sixpoint's offerings, but this, the Bengali IPA, and the Apollo Wheat really won me over.

4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, semi-sweet, mildly fizzy up front and leading to a creamy, smooth ending that has a texture like a piece of tiramisu.","weeare138","Apr 19, 2007"
3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a nice slightly cloudy dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice huge two finger off-white creamy head, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slight hop, slight chocolate, and caramel. The taste is malty, and a nice chocolate/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice/different brown ale, recommended.","Wasatch","Mar 05, 2007"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is an interesting brown ale, definitely something new, at least for me. The flavor is far less sweet than many brown ales (Dogfish Head or Avery), but also has a sort of bakery quality that I don't remember having before. It seemed a bit more "British" to me than most American Brown Ales. Good overall.","auntfloyd","Dec 12, 2006"
4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Had this on tap at Fraunce's Tavern. It pours wonderfully with a gargantuan off-white head that quickly settled down to a nice thin lace. The smell was bready but I got a lot coffee and caramel notes in there too. One of my friends was nursing it but I found it highly drinkable and tasty. I had quite a few. This is another great brew from the guys at Sixpoint.","lehows","Nov 29, 2006"
4.8,23.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Some of my new in-laws live in Michigan and are serious beer afficionados, lovers of Kalamazoo and Kuehnenn's, and proclaimed that I am their new favorite in law because of my taste in beer; meanwhile, several guests made a point to find us during the night and thank us for sharing this beer because they loved it so much, despite not being really "big beer drinkers." Yeah, it's that good. The best brown ale I've ever had.","bultrey","Nov 16, 2006"
3.73,-4.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a pretty solid brown ale. The taste is buscuity and caramel malts with bitterness coming through near the finish. Not as sweet as some other browns. Mouthfeel was full and chewy. It was a very filling beer for me, so I don't know that I would call it sessionable, but it's still quite drinkable. Overall a reccomended brown ale from Sixpoint.","BBM","Nov 02, 2006"

4.31,10.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Creamy white head, dark brown with ruby red hues, doesn't smell like much but very malty, coffee, smooth taste and a bit of chocolatey caramel sweetness with just the right amount of hops on the top. The standout qualities of this beer are the taste and the mouthfeel. I would have to say this beer was perfectly carbonated. Very effervescent, but not "big bubbled" like soda, it's like a brown ale with the carbonation of an Aventinus and it really brings out the taste. Combine that with the lite hoppiness and the sweetness and you have a refreshing brown ale, even in the muggy hot summer. I normally don't touch anything but wheat beers or IPAs in the summer but this is way, way worth it.","PopeJonPaul","Sep 19, 2005"
4.2,8,4,4,4,5,4.5,"another attempt to beat the heat. what could be more refreshing than a nice brown ale? pours a very solid dark brown. par for the sixpoint course, this beer looks foreboding in a serious way. looking at it makes me sweat more. creamy and thin coating of cottony foam. uniform lacing. looks like a homemade root beer. aroma is dominated by a bitter nuttiness with a mild hint of aromatic hops. more traditional nose, very fresh hints of soft-baked pretzel. wow, this is a smooth beer. slides down the throat like silk, emitting more of that roasted nut flavor as well as a touch of botanical green hoppiness. malt character isn't too thick or overbearing, but rather buttery and velvety. finishes bitter but not oppressive with a nougat flavor and some wheat bread. beery and delicious.","goodbyeohio","Aug 09, 2005"
3.83,-1.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Six point's nite at the Blind Tiger in NYC, sampled a pint of this one first. Pours chocolaty brown and murky, Nose is faintly bready. Minimal white head was noticed and minor lacing was left on the glass. I picked up some caramel, chocolate, and roasted grains. This is a lightly hopped, medium bodied, pleasant and refreshing brew. Perhaps a tad thin in the flavor department, but still a decent sessioner.","Billolick","Mar 17, 2005"
3.78,-2.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a light, old copper like brown with a decent sized off white head. Aroma is not all that strong, and we had a hard time really getting anything at all out of it until it warmed. Eventually there were some soft caramel smells and a twinge of citrus. Flavor is actually decent, a nice amount of hops balance a thin malt backbone. Drinkable for a brown beer, something I would enjoy in the sumer especially.","ChowHound","Mar 15, 2005"
