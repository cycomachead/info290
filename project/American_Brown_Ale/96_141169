3.13,-8.5,3,3,3.25,3.25,3,"Poured from a bottle into a craft beer glass.  It had a hazy brown color that was clear on the bottom half that had a very small head that didn't leave lacing.  It smells of pine and hops with a light nuttiness.  There was a slightly sweet nutty taste up front, with sharp pine taking over in the middle before ending with a slightly bitter hop flavor.  It was certainly a hoppy brown ale as advertised, but it was slightly unbalanced and could've used more nuttiness to balance out the hops.  Medium-light body with moderate carbonation.  It had a pleasant mouthfeel despite the bitter hops aftertaste.  Overall, it is a well hopped brown ale that left room for improvement.  I'm glad I tried it but I didn't like it enough to buy it again.","OKbrew89","Mar 01, 2015"

3.68,7.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/13/2014. Pours slightly hazy light reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, light citrus/pine, herbal, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, pine, herbal, grass, light citrus, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice hoppy brown ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 14, 2015"

The taste leads with some meek caramel and biscuit, then goes into a wave of greens, grass, and mild pine, and then ends with a soft touch of walnut.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this one didn't quite do it for me.

Aroma is nutty/chocolatey with grassy hops - not particularly bright, just average 'brown ale'. Caramelish, nutty, and lightly milk-chocolate in the flavor. Herbal, floral and subtly piney hops 'spruce it up' a bit. Solidly bitter. Dry finish. Remains an average 'brown ale' with a few extra hops thrown in, but balanced and drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Dec 19, 2014"

I think the abv is right on too for the style and the season.","StonedTrippin","Nov 27, 2014"

Snow Roller is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell rich with sweetness and grains. Now for the taste , it is bitter at first with a clean finish. Snow Roller has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Even the bitterness is nice in this brew. The mouthfeel is bold at first but snow roller has a clean finish.

I get a light scent of chocolate malt when I really struggle to detect it.  The dark malt with chocolate notes presents itself more boldly in the flavor.  There's also the twist of having some grapefruit like hoppiness in the mix.  I'm not sure this flavor pairing is working.  The mouth is moderately carbonated.","Franziskaner","Nov 22, 2014"

4.75,38.9,,,,,,"Very well balanced hopiness with the brown ale flavors. This beer has something for ipa and ale lovers alike. Leaves you with a nice warming sensation with every sip. I'm on my 4th 6 pack and can't get enough!  Don't generally drink Magic Hat but they've really got a hit here!","RazorbackGT","0"
