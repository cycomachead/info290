The aroma is light, with just mild hints of roasted malt and fruit. The taste, though has a nice rich malty profile, with a nice dark bread flavor and hints of earthy hops on the finish. The body has a nice thickness to it, full on the pallet.","delta490","Mar 28, 2015"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little rich, a little filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one glass is enough for me, I feel no need to drink another. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was a pretty nice looking beer and it looked fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was strong earthy aspect, it would be better if it was toned down a good amount. I wouldn't buy this beer and I wouldn't recommend it as a good Doppelbock since it isn't the truest of the style to me. All in all I was little let down with this beer, Epic has proven to be pretty solid, but this one was lacking in most all aspects.

The first noticeable impression is the great substantial mouth feel. Almost bready. The nutty flavors were fruity with a bit of raisins thrown in. Very dry lingering taste that is somewhat woody and mild brown sugars. Alcohol is noticeable in the taste, but not unpleasant at all. The ABV is a bit high for the style. I can imagine this would be great with some sauerkraut and a great braut and a pretzel. Very solid for the style, especially for the price.
