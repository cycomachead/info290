Nose of rich DEEPLY roasted coffee, light smoke, brown sugars, and even more coffee.  Flavors are up front bitter black coffee, light bready sweet malts and brown sugar to the sides, and a mild smoke character on the back with oily coffee goodness.  Very coating wet aftertaste.  Never seen one like this before, and truly enjoyed it's flavors of rich coffee being a strong black coffee drinker.  A good finisher for an evening.","Brutaltruth","Dec 09, 2014"

There was a crazy amount of head development as I poured, but that dissipated after about 10 minutes and there wound up being not much lacing. The smell is mild, with the coffee and malt coming through in equal proportions. The taste leans heavily to the coffee - and I really enjoy that aspect. It's not terribly complex but it doesn't need to be. The mouthfeel is a little odd, but it's hard to put my finger on the reason. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Dopplebocks can be rather unassuming, but I think the coffee addition makes this beer stand out.","mc4z","Nov 27, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark roasted coffee, caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, light raisin, light apple, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of coffee, malt, and yeast notes; with decent strength. Taste of dark roasted coffee, caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, apple, raisin, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, roast, toast, toffee, apple, raisin, brown bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt, coffee, and yeast notes; with a fair amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is good; could use more body though. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good doppelbock style. Good balance and complexity of coffee, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. Not as malty robust as I was hoping for, but still a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

The doppelbock is by far my favorite beer style, so I was naturally skeptical that a brewery would seek to alter such a strong and already flavorful style. My skepticism was well founded. I picked up a four pack of this brew, in hopes that it would be a nice marriage of dark beer styles. Sadly, it was not. The coffee grounds did not mesh well with the strong flavors of the doppelbock style. The nose smells of rich malt but then diminishes with the coffee smells. The taste also exhibits a conflicted character with the strong maltiness and caramel notes competing with the coffee notes. This one is a unique experience, but not one I'd seek out again.","jmendels","Apr 09, 2013"

The bottle I have does not look like this picture but has a big goat headed man on it and looks like it came from a metal video. I think this packaging better reflects what this beer is truly about as it is a pretty unholy union of flavor to create something compelling and interesting and new.

Taste has a weird acidic sourness derived from a vast amount of roast, bitter and raw beans again. Dark breads and gentle caramel. Medium carbonation and an ok body.

Coffee taste is very prominent in the first few drinks, accompanied by a strong bitter-coffee finish that hangs around a bit. Working through the glass the coffee becomes less prominent/noticeable and tastes like a semi-sweet roast. Smooth mouthfeel, with some dryness. This is an interesting beer, aside from the nose, which I don't care for, it has a decent flavor profile and drinks pretty easily in small doses.","stealth","Jan 16, 2012"

I would seek out again- a good coffee beer is pretty valuable to me, and I don't get many good ones locally.","lnashsig","Sep 02, 2011"

I wasn't able to get much malt of hop flavors at all. The coffee just really over powers everything in this beer. The mouthfeel in medium and doesn't have much carbonation.

As it warms, more coffee, bitterness and sweetness comes out. It's a bit odd tasting and not particularly enjoyable. This is a bit thinner than expected for a doppelbock. Overall, I don't think this is a very successful experiment. It seems like they toned down a Doppelbock's sweetness and body to allow the coffee to come through to neither's benefit.

No lacing on this one. Nose expresses slightly vegetal coffee grounds, a hint of lactose and something sweet. Taste reveals slightly vinous fruit, a sugary character and coffee grounds - less vegetal than in the nose; however, the flavor lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a lively, almost prickly carbonation. There's also some acidity that stimulates the tip of the tongue and the sides of the cheek.

It drinks fine, it's both fresh and crisp with good carbonation. Despite my ranking, I actually do like this because I'm not a huge fan of traditional doppelbocks.

Drying on the finish with plenty of coffee flavor with very low coffee bitterness or acidity, emphasizing the fruitiness. Moderate caramel sweetness is present, particularly on the mid-palate. All of this really makes this taste like dulce de leche + coffee. Medium in body, this is rather dry. Carbonation is moderate, but the finish is a little disappointing as it doesn't have much lingering flavor, just some carbonic acid. This is a rather terrible dopplebock, but it is a rather enjoyable beer. The purity of the coffee flavor makes me think of fresh Peche Mortel.","DefenCorps","Jan 23, 2011"

It has a strong roasted coffee aroma, I didn't really get any of the familiar bock scents, just coffee. The coffee was much stronger in the nose than it was on the tongue. This beer had a strong malty sweetness, lots of caramel goodness going on here, with the coffee only coming through at the end on the back of the tongue. I liked it a lot, neither flavor was fighting for the spotlight and it turned out to be a well balanced brew. Perkulator was a truly interesting beer, Dark Horse gets some bonus points for trying something new with such an established style.","biggerboat88","Sep 29, 2010"
3.5,-5.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"*sigh* Well, anyway, this guy pours a murky panoply of shades of brown topped by about a half-finger or so of glowing off-white foam. The nose begins with a nostril-stabbing blast of cocoa-drenched coffee beans, sweeter than I've ever beheld such beans before. As this scent slowly fades, some dark toffee, burnt molasses, dark leafy greens, and oak meld together to form a fairly convincing malty backdrop. The taste is pretty much summed up in the smell, though the coffee tapers out a bit into the cocoa, making its inclusion a bit less of an imposition. Unfortunately, everything else is also toned down slightly. The body is a stoic medium, though it seems like its gaining weight, with a light carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, an interesting brew, but nothing I would really jump for again.","TMoney2591","Sep 23, 2010"

The beer is very dark even by doppelbock standards and has a light coffee aroma to go with the strong smell of toasted bread, browning butter and burning sugar. The beer is like a latte with a roasted aroma from coffee and toasted malt upfront, with sweetness and body from the caramelized malt. This paired very well with a rich chocolate cake and bread pudding, both served with fresh strawberries and blueberries.","Soonami","Sep 06, 2010"

I did notice that this batch had some spiciness to it that I didn't get in the last one. The nose had a frank red hot sauce like spiciness to it that was different but enjoyable, the spiciness carried on to the taste but was much more subdued and didn't over power the coffee, it actually went well with the coffee flavors. I also noticed this batch had better carbonation and head retention. Its nice to have a coffee flavored beer every once in a while that isn't a porter or a stout. This one also had a really kick ass label that the other one didn't, its got an awesome evil, death metal vibe to it that suits this beer, I like how Dark Horse gets different artists to do different versions of their labels, it shows how free thinking and open minded Dark Horse really is.

Continuous amount of bubbles rise to the surface providing support for an offwhite colored head. Initially poured more than a finger thick of big white bubbles that receeded back to a thin layer covering the beer. Aroma of this beer has a mix of roasty coffee and malt/alcohol that almost comes across as being musty. Taste of this beer is...well, a doppelbock. I know it sounds unoriginal and uninspiring but that is it. Nothing immediately strikes outside of the norm other than a noticable amount of alcohol warmth and an aftertaste that includes a bit of the coffee and just a slight bit of the roasted coffee that is reminding me of something musty comes through in the finish of the taste as well. The coffee is a nice little addition to this beer, not an out of control and a dominating amount but just subtle enough to throw a mix into the style.

There's a light hop presence that's buried underneath all the malts and coffee, but they're there. There's a light spiciness, and slight warming alcohol on the finish.

Maybe too much....yes, too much. Way too much. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer has the biggest coffee character of any coffee beer I've yet tasted. Until now I never thought I would think a beer had too much coffee, but this one certainly does.

The dopplebock portion of this beer comes out more in taste with caramel malt among others ans some dark fruit with pear. Coffee is not as big as expected from the smell.

The bock adds a caramel sweetness that nicely balances out the bitterness of the coffee. The coffee is more of a roasted flavor or anything too intense. Lighter side of medium bodied with strong carbonation results in a very frothy, light body. The addition of coffee to this style isn't doing that much for me.

3.98,7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall- I was drawn by the idea of a "Coffee Dopplebock." I've seen plenty of coffee stouts, but this style was new to me. It's a pretty big departure from most doppelbocks I've tried, but I'm a pretty big fan. It definitely has solid coffee flavor, but isn't so over-the-top that you wouldn't want another.","GRPunk","Dec 07, 2008"
4.02,8.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a dimpled mug. This dopplebock poured a murky, ruby brown hue with a short-lived head of tan foam that settled into a lasting ring. A small amount of slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma had a very pronouced note of cold pressed coffee. A solid dose of caramel and dark fruit also made an appearance. The flavor contained a smooth coffee note (not bitter like alot of other coffee-infused beers), dark fruit skins, caramel, and a hint of baker's chocolate. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and had light carbonation. Filling for sure, but yet quite drinkable. Very enjoyable. Nice to see the guys at Dark Horse give a lager a try.","mdm46410","Dec 06, 2008"
4.39,18,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - Drinks like a champ for an 8% dopplebock. The warmth of the alcohol is non-existent. The coffee character wins out in the end, making for an extremely smooth and drinkable dopplebock. One of the highlights of my recent Mid-west excursion.","ffejherb","Dec 02, 2008"
4.34,16.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a cola and ruby brown with practically no head or foam. Can't see any bubbling in this dark brew. Smells like when you just break open a Folgers tin and take a whiff. Plus the sweet, dark toasted malts and fruits add a little complexity to the nose. The taste starts with undeniable coffee. You then get some of that signature dopplebock malt character. Toasted and sweet with some woody plums. t to metion a toucof smokiness too. Is that from the coffee or malt??? Chewy sweet palate that is complex and different from the norm. A good beer to drink and think, contemplate, and enjoy.","scruffwhor","Nov 27, 2008"
3.73,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5," I like the coffee flavors even if I'm not a big fan of coffee. It works with this style of brew. I'm not a big fan of the finish and that distracts from the overall enjoyment of the brew.","jbphoto88","Nov 27, 2008"

3.62,-2.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From a 12oz bottle - Pours a clear root beer color with small quickly dissipating head. Below average carbonation. Smells only of coffee and not much else in the nose.

3.82,2.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,3,"Overall: This is a noble experiment and for the most part executed well. However, it seems to rely too much on the coffee to provide bitterness and the end result is a slightly unbalanced brew. Coffee fans should definitely try this but overall I'd rather have a four-pack of Dark Horse's non-caffeinated Doppelbock offering.","Windigstadt","Oct 20, 2008"
4.05,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"It was nice to see a doppelbock getting in on the coffee action that seems mostly limited to porters and stouts. The malty nature of the doppelbock really complements the coffee flavor and makes it drink like an alcoholic iced coffee - which is both a strength and a weakness, as it makes this brew a little shallow.","MasterSki","Oct 20, 2008"
4.29,15.3,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: While this beer does not seem to match up with traditional doppelbocks in terms of fitting into style guidelines, the beer still tastes and feels great and drinks way, way too easy.

3.77,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,3,"Perkulator pours a mahogany brown color with some orange/red highlights and a small tan head. The nose and taste share similar notes of bourbon, wet wood, sweet molasses, coffee bean, whiskey malt or corn mash, and very musky, cherry vanilla sweetness. The alcohol content is not threatening. Coffee doesnt come through as bright as had been expected but it plays a critical role in its bitterness and overall texture. Full bodied, this is a large brew great stuff though, very drinkable.","ATPete","Sep 21, 2008"
4.15,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a great coffee beer for it's balance. In my opinion, too many coffee beers are all about the beans, with beer just acting as a prop. Perkulator pairs the smooth malty caramel of a doppelbock with fresh, dark-roasted coffee and I'm loving it. Easy to drink from the not-too-thick (for a doppel) body and delicious. A must-try for fans of coffee beer.","tempest","Aug 31, 2008"
4.17,12.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep mahogany brown with not so much a head as a mild fizzing that sticks around on the edges of the glass. Smells of coffee and a malty sweetness and a mild bread-like smell. Taste is malty, chocolaty coffee with the coffee dominating the finish. Notes of cinnamon poke out as the glass warms a bit. The coffee has definitely toned down in the 6 months or so since I purchased it, but I think that is actually an improvement as the other flavors of the beverage are allowed to come forward. Overall, another solid, well-balanced brew from Darkhorse that I could sit and drink all evening and probably will.","FrognutUnl","Jul 11, 2008"
3.18,-14.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Tastes refined coffee. Clena leaves fresh ground coffee flavor hanging in aftertaste. Caramel with deep searching. Decent sweet to counter the coffee, but pretty one-dimensional. Mild sting from carbonation. Clean lager that avoids off-flavors. Md body with clean alcohol sting. Decent beer, but very simple.","mentor","Jul 06, 2008"

Aroma of medium coffee notes with a lightly sweet caramel malt base. Taste is also a mix between a lightly sweet caramel malt base with some nice medium notes of dry coffee. Average body with some OK carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not extremely complex but well done and interesting take on the doppelbock style.","Phyl21ca","Jun 09, 2008"

3.64,-2.2,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours dark maroon with a large medium sized beige head. Smell is of sweet maltiness and nice strong coffee. Taste is about what I'd expect from the name. Rich and malty as expected from a dopplebock with a nice coffee flavor as well. Finishes more malty with little coffee flavor at the end. Pretty nice and drinkable. Medium to slightly rich body with good carbonation. Fairly noticeable tartness in the finish that detracted somewhat.","JDV","Apr 06, 2008"

Big thanks again to Derek!","younger35","Apr 02, 2008"
3.72,0,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dark amber with a fluffy one finger light khaki colored head that takes its time to die down. A small layer of foam sticks to the sides. Bubbles rising to the top throughout the entire tasting. Smell is coffee grinds and bitter chocolate up front. Sweet caramel malt underneath with a woody scent as well. Alcohol is present, but not over the top. Very enjoyable in the nose, I could whiff this all day (and morning). Slight bitterness on the first sip with a big coffee backbone. I was hoping for more sweet caramel malt, but the coffee flavor all over the tongue. Some smokey wood flavors and a bit of molasses in the aftertaste. Medium grainy body with a good amount of carbonation. Not as creamy as I'd like with the style, but I'll take it. Interesting twist on the doppelbock, not sure I like it though.

Taste is similar with a front load of acidic roasted, nutty coffee bitterness, but just enough--not too much. Sweet, doppelbocky malts come in right away.
