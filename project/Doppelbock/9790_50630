Very drinkable - this went down quickly and then that higher ABV let me know it was there. I could easily see myself getting a 6 pack of this next time I can do so. It reminds me a bit of Ayinger Celebrator, but not as deep in flavor. The mouthfeel was a tad disappointing for this style, but otherwise a very good beer.","damndirtyape","Jul 03, 2014"

3.85,-4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed vase, the beer is a auburn-highlighted brown coloring with a thin, sparse, cream colored surface coating of head. Aromas of rich toffee and caramel forward, with date, raisin, and cherry sweet and rich highlights. Roasted highlights keep the sweet reigned in, making this a very balanced nose. Flavors are roasted heavily on the forward tongue, with rich toffee, chocolate, and caramel notes. The old-world fruit characteristics are present in highlight form, and there are some earthy notes, as well. This is a tasty malt-bomb! Smooth and robust in mouth, with a slight effervesced edge to keep the drinkability up. The aftertaste is surprisingly crisp, keeping all the sweet characteristics from becoming overpowering. Smooth, slick finish with only a minimally sweet linger thanks to the carbonation. Solid brew!","GarthDanielson","Apr 19, 2014"

A thick, rich aroma, mostly bready and roasted malts along with some dark chocolate sweetness. Taste and mouthfeel is more of the same as the beer is thick, fuller-bodied, not sticky nor watery but a nice thick smoothness, mixed roasted and breadlike malts for dryness with dark chocolate, toffee, and caramel for sweetness. Not typical of other DBs I've had in terms of the dryness and the finish, which is less sweet more dry, and not much in terms of any fruit flavors at all (can't say I really got a hold of any dark fruits or minor citric hops) but still a pretty good beer.","clayrock81","Jul 23, 2013"

Aroma in particular reminds me a lot of their 2012 Barleywine disaster. Never had a sour or funky Doppelbock before, so I’ve got to assume this is not what the brewer was shooting for. In an effort to be fair, I will try one more bottle just in case this one was an anomaly and will adjust my review accordingly if needed. As it stands right now, this is a terrible Doppelbock.

The taste was not as sweet as I had anticipated. The malts appeared to be well roasted, giving a bitter coffee effect at first sip. This was followed by a fruity tartness, semi-sweet powdered cocoa, and a woody, dry finish. This was a surprisingly complex juxtaposition of flavors for the style. The body was not as silky smooth as the best examples of the style. Quite a different experience from others of this style.","rajendra82","Aug 31, 2012"

Even if I did appreciate the balance more, however, I feel that a doppelbock should ram you with its two horns (I'm so clever) a bit more roughly.

Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toasted malt, biscuit, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel.

4.18,4.2,4,3.5,5,3,4,"Duck Rabbator pours a *very* dark brown, it's almost stout-like in appearance. A three and a half finger caramel head pops up and fades fast and clean at first. At about a finger and a half though things slow down and some serious head retention kicks in. There's a solid amount of lacing left clinging to the side of the glass as well. The nose is a bit unexciting, it's very heavy on biscuity malts, with just a hint of plums showing up as well. With my expectations somewhat tapered, the first few sips then were a revelation. Duck Rabbator is a seamless blend of just about everything one could want from a malt heavy beer. Biscuit, caramel, toasted nuts, cocoa and dark sweet fruits all have a turn shining through. The body is spot on, lush and full. The carbonation though is a bit lackluster. Don't get me wrong, in a beer like this I'm looking for the carbonation to be a bit on the low side, but it's almost nonexistent here and the beer is bordering a bit on being syrupy. In some ways Duck Rabbator is a world class Doppelbock, but it's also a somewhat uneven brew.","axeman9182","Feb 15, 2011"

Pours the color of cola with a thin head that dissipates into a cluster of bubbles, forming a thin band around the perimeter of the bowl. Nose reveals cocoa and dark fruit - very similar to a Baltic Porter in character, with a slightly acidic quality in the mix. Taste follows nose with a slightly earthy quality, some licorice and a sour mash character that reveals itself as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation that is slightly higher than optimal. This is a delicious and drinkable brew; perhaps not quite style consistent and closer to a Baltic Porter than a Doppelbock, but incredibly tasty nonetheless.","Jwale73","Oct 13, 2010"
4.32,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Close to three fingers of dark tan head, a lot of larger bubbles interspersed throughout, pops and sizzles down to the surface at a steady gait, the lacing slides down the glass side in solid sheets. Very dark brown in color with a mild orange tint, no murkiness at all, just darkness, a pleasing package visually. There's enough roast to the nose to evoke coffee, dark baker's chocolate and a pinch of chicory, softened by butterscotch, rum raisin and date to fig fruit notes, very light banana too, the hops more like straw or hay than anything fresh and green, muscular tenacity in your nostrils. Full-bodied, dry and crisp mouth entry, the carbonation well-defined and brisk. Sip by sip you get more chocolate, butterscotch, nougat, molasses and coffee hard candy. The raisin, fig, date, maraschino cherry flavors not overly sweet and strongest past the mid-palate. More of foresty, mossy sort of herbaceousness here, wetter and livelier. Minimal citrus or spice, sticks to the core message. Richness without heaviness.","farrago","Sep 30, 2010"

Atop is a nice tan head that is quick to relinquish its grip on the surface of the beer. The smells bring many thoughts to mind most of them tasty. The main aromas are a molasses and booze, but there is also a nice paring of pineapple and caramel as well to make it very interesting. The taste is clearly of the sweet molasses, but that's not all. There are hints lemon zest, plum and smoked malts with a prominent spiced rum kicker in the back. The mouthfeel is rather decent while the beer is perfect in its consistency and carbonation the booze content is a bit on the acidic side to where it attacks the sides of the tongue.

4.12,2.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark. The light reveals mahogany to garnet hues. Topped by a modest khaki foam - about 1 finger at first, then sticks around as a thin sudsy sheet. Molassas, dark fruits and some complex chocolate malt aromas. Nutty with a touch of chocolate malt roastiness that adds a little to the bitterness and also contributes some cocoa powder flavor. A hint of plum tries to dig through the roast, finding it's way through from time to time, more-so in the aroma. A tad minerally, but just barely, adding some sharpness. Kind of reminds me of a strong brown ale. There is an overall complexity to it that is hard for me to describe. Alcohol is detectable, but fairly well hidden until it smacks you upside the head. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth except for the sharpness. Assertive and solid. Improves as it warms; the roastiness starts to give a little way to the dark fruits and hints of cherry. A tad roasty to be truly traditional, but still a nice beer from the dark beer specialists. If this wasn't labeled a doppelbock, I would probably give it a bump for taste.","NCBeernut","Jul 28, 2010"

The nose comprises biscuits, caramel, toffee, light roasted malts, brown sugar, and a pinch o' nutmeg. The taste shows us that those biscuits were left in the oven a tad too long, blackening their bottoms. The caramel is similarly burnt. Everything else is normal, but muted somewhat in the face of the charcoal-laden bits. That may sound entirely negative, but it really isn't...just different and kinda unexpected.

4.32,7.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - Duck-Rabbitor drinks like a champ for an 8.5% Dopplebock. I really enjoyed this one, perhaps enough to crown it as my favorite Duck-Rabbit release thus far. This one definitely exceeded my expectations.","ffejherb","Sep 18, 2009"

4.52,12.7,4,4.5,5,4,4,"D: Pretty good for the style. Alcohol taste doesn't hold you back, but I've never felt like dopplebocks are the kind of beer for sessioning anyways.","johannasclimacus","Aug 21, 2009"
4.32,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: Fantastic... maybe a little extra roasted malt flavor than your typical authentic doppelbock, but whose complaining? The ABVS are higher, but hidden.","rfgetz","Aug 18, 2009"
4.27,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer that will last a while. Can't see having more than two pints in a session but this will last you a while.","Gavage","Jul 25, 2009"
4.02,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This is one hefty doppelbock here,poured a deep dark amber-brown with a thinner off white head atop.Big caramel and dark fruit in the nose with a tad bit of sweet dough,flavors have a big sweet dough base mixed with alcohol dipped dark fruit,the big malt tones are the main component of the beer,its bigger than most I have had of the style.It has big flavor and complexity but its rich and a a bit heavy even for the style.","oberon","Jul 13, 2009"
4.3,7.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A really fine stab at the style; a bit pepperier than the Germans make it but that is actually a nice touch","brentk56","Jul 10, 2009"
4.22,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"The mouth was a little disappointing. Fairly wet and slick. Expected a bit more carbonation on the tongue, but it was not there. Pretty weak and thin. Flavor was of big chocolate, and pumpernickel bread. Huge mealy taste. Very heavy and fulfilling beer here. Finishes slightly bittersweet, like coffee. Hints of minerals in there as well, which in my experience is a common thread for all DR beers. This is really good. I wish they would bottle this.","Onenote81","Jun 24, 2009"
4.28,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The drink is full-bodied, smooth, syrupy-rich and creamy in feel. Carbonation is mild and the brew silky-sweet and highly sippable. Hella potent to the point I doubt the ABV is 'only' 8.5%, and a damned-excellent first-lager offering from the Dark Beer Specialists in Farmville!","cvstrickland","Jun 22, 2009"

4.35,8.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another treat from The Brick Store 12th Anniversary. A 10 oz. pour into the very nice Duck Rabbit "multi-head" snifter. Pours a medium to dark brown color with a thin tan head, not too thick, as some light makes its way through. A nice aroma from the dark malt provides a mixture of chocolate and dark fruits. The taste is far stronger in these characteristics, as it a delicious mixture of chocolate, coffee, and raisons. There is a bitter tip to it at the end, maybe a slightly more pronounced hop presence? Not as thick as a lot of Duck Rabbit's offerings, it is much more medium bodied. While thin, there is no overabundance of carbonation, so it is still a smooth sipper. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, further proof of Duck Rabbit's strong presence in the dark beer world.","bhalter8","Beers"
4.13,3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub during their 12th anniversary celebration. 10 oz poured into a Duck-Rabbit branded snifter. Very nice beer and a great first attempt at a lager by this brewery. Pours a dark brown with a bit of transluscence and a relatively thin, swirly head. Smells malty, but a bit thin. Slightly sweet in the nose with some raisins and molasses, but not at all syrup like, a good deal dryer than that. The taste is very nice. Rich and very, very smooth with restrained sweetness but a firm maltiness. Some notes of chocolate, molasses, lots of caramel, some raisins and plums, and maybe even a tad of coffee bitterness. A touch of lager yeast tang throughout, but this is very subtle. Silky, not sticky in the mouth. I love how smooth and wonderful this is in the mouth. Silken and so nice. Slightly sweet, but there is a bit of burnt caramel and a tiny core of bitterness that helps balance everything. A lovely beer, and I'm glad I got to try some.","Georgiabeer","0"
