Head retention is less than I would have liked. The 2nd bottle seemed less sweet; my palate must have re-adjusted. These go down very easy. It's no wonder that they built a biergarten as a safe harbor. Solid Bock.","Dragyourbone1","Nov 29, 2014"

3.76,-2.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"So, do gentlemen prefer this kind of doppelbock? Regardless, this stuff pours a clear golden-brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, honey, a hint of vanilla, sweet flowers, and a twang of candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a pinch of clove, a hint of sweet corn, and an extra tad of breadiness. There's a definite sense of booze in there, but it doesn't have all that much effect. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a solid doppelbock, as per usual when Capital is involved, though I'm not sue the blonde-ness was all that effective in the final execution. I mean, I like this beer, but their other d-bocks just hold up a bit better in my eyes.","TMoney2591","0"

3.9,1,4,4,3.75,4,4,"The beer was poured into a goblet from the bottle with a golden appearance. It had about 3/4 inch head with a slight yellow tint to the white bubbles. The beer smelled like a good German beer. One can smell the grain as well as the alcohol. Even in the aroma one detects a certain measure of creaminess. On the initial taste, one detects buttermilk biscuits, earthy grass notes, a hint of spiciness, and perhaps a hint of corn to lend the creaminess of the beer. As is traditionally the case, a doppelbock is a meal in itself. The thickness allows the taste to stick to the back of the throat as the biscuits turns sour and fade. In terms of the style, I miss the darker notes of a regular doppelbock. The blonde version is solid, but leaves something to be desired.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 01, 2013"

Aroma is grainy, malty, citrusy, and a bit alcoholic. The taste here is quite interesting, the main thing I get on the tongue is booze, but it's not overbearing. It's actually tempered well with some green apple, grains, lemons, and caramel malts. But, yeah, it's a boozy brew. The mouthfeel is fairly full and decently carbonated, and the drinkability is pretty good, considering the booziness. This brew almost reminds me of a barleywine since the alcohol is just so forward.

Tastes 'brighter' (dumb word choice, I know) or at least livelier than many a dark doppelbock I can think of, but would easily strike you average everyday-drinker of light lagers as a so-called 'dark beer' if it were offered to him or her in a blind taste test. Light honey notes start this one out, and fairly linger throughout, playing of some rich caramel-noted malts and a touch of crystal malt for sweetness. Light hints of molasses. As with a few other doppelbocks I could mention, this one is on the fruity side for a lager, and this is to its credit. Honey notes in the aromatics, and the barest hint of candi sugar keep you guessing at this one: ale or lager? Almost mead-like in character, with a firm, medium body, slightly thick/slightly creamy mouthfeel, and excellent drinkability. This is just an excellent brew, plain and simple, and it's worth whatever the good folks at Capital feel they should get for it.

This beer pours out a slightly hazy amber color with a large, creamy head. The aroma is quite malty with a bit of fruitiness. Alcohol is noticable in the nose. The flavor is very malty with notes of apples and coconut. This is not what you think of as your standard dopplebock. Although it is malty, it is not dark. It is, however, refreshing and delicious. It is also drinkable in large quantities. Try it on tap, and you will see what an exceptional beer this is.","beveragecaptain","Dec 15, 2005"

Smell is citrusy and floral with a nice malt kick. Taste starts off with that strong malt backbone and adds in the nice hoppy citrus/floral notes to balance it off nicely. Mouthfeel is on the crisp side, but not as biting as some dopples I've had. This is a tasty-ass brew right here. Extremely drinkable for 6.9%.

Malty, pilsen and caramel, just a light hint of toast in the finish. Hop character is very subdued, just adding some bitterness. The yeast is spicey, a just noticable ester that I've really come to look forward to in the Capital Bocks. This beer is smooth and totally hides the alcohol with its sweet malt charater. Another great lager from Capital.","redmosquito","Mar 17, 2005"

Golden honey in color, since I was pouring we both ended up with 1/2 heads of off-white, thick head. It left in a hurry, so I am concentrating on the aroma...first impresion: it smells like beer. Second one, when you take some big whiffs off the glass, you encounter good German maltiness/graininess, and also alcohol struggling to get through. Mouthfeel is full -, and I've head this beer for about 30 minutes by now, so it has warmed up a bit. It was a bit tastier about 15 minutes ago. I think the alcohol has intensified, and it's the first thing I encounter now. There's some malty sweetness, but the alcohol definitely appears again in the finish. Word to wise...drink it before it gets too warm. Before it did, I thought it was pretty thick malt, with some hops in the finish.","PatandDavid","Jul 18, 2004"

Smell is a lightened but darker orange and a terrific caramel sweetness in the nose. Rich and creamy taste, a bit of chewyness with good amount of caramel malts and a pretty moderate amount of dulled bitterness that has a great little hold of solid tang from hops. Excellently balanced. Great malt body, quite hefty with a bready thickness. Feel is a partially full bodied, creamy, chewy, nearly cloying, crisp full finish. Extremely drinkable, yummy, delicious, rich and creamy delightful wonderment. Capital has a winner with this one.","tavernjef","Jun 10, 2003"
4.25,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a clear amber in color with a thin white head that eventually retreats to the side of the glass. Aroma consists of sweet malt, citrus and light hops. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and creamy, yet also has some noticable carbonation toward the finish. Pleasant malt sweetness noticed initially. Additional combination of toffee, caramel and biscuit carries through. Finishes strong with some alcohol flavor present. Doesn't seem as "heavy" as the dark doppelbock that they produce.

4.25,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Its brilliant amber robe takes on a crimson cast when set upon the bar, and the frothy white head seems to last forever. It continually retains a thin, creamy cap and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The body is medium/full and it's smooth and creamy across the palate. Fresh and clean, gently toasted malt is present in the nose; and then again in the flavor. It's not a complex beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it is surprisingly rich and satisfying. The clean, pure flavor of Munich malt is nicely balanced by an underlying bitterness and a bit of drying alcohol that lends toward a note of apple. Mild honeyish-vanilla and caramel evolve as it warms, backed by some very low level hop flavor; and the finish is long lasting with residual nutty malt and a wash of drying alcohol. It's an interesting doppelbock in that it's very clean-cut and straightforward, yet satisfying. It doesn't have the depth of many darker versions, but it's impelling. Certainly worth trying.","NeroFiddled","May 10, 2003"
4.32,11.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear copper appearance. Little head surprisingly, but a nice collar and good lacing. Deep bavarian malt aroma. Excellent. The nose is sweet as well as malty. Luscious taste. Deep malt. Some toasted notes. Just the slightest hint of alcohol. Bready and yeasty. And a little grainy as well. It's very nice. The body is full and gratifying.

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Amber hue, with a slight chill haze. Steadfast, uniformily thick white head. Belgian lace remains. Waft of wort like maltose and spent, freshly mashed grain hits the nose at first, then is ensued by mildly herbal hops and toasty Munich malt. Toffeeish melanoidins surface as the beer warms, but remain subdued. Rounded, mellow, honey laced sweetness bathes the palate initially and is complemented by nutty, lightly buttery notes of brittle and caramel. Hints of caramelized figs emerge mid palate along with a suggestion of sugary red licorice. Decocted? Hop bitterness is paltry, and functionally prevents cloying sweetness. Trace herbal Hallertauer hop flavor adds a "green" note to the deeply sweet malt profile. Full bodied, with a smooth, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes with lingering buttery poundcake like sweetness. A tasty brew that's akin to hellesbock / doppel hybrid. A touch shy in malt complexity, but nevertheless superior to many US microbrewed bocks.","marc77","Mar 16, 2003"

Full mouthfeel, coating and long lasting with more carbonation than the Dark Doppelbock or Autumnal Fire. Flavor is the most muted of the Capital limited release Doppelbocks, pleasant and sweet but not straying from medium dark caramel at first and deconstructing to a honey and slight molasses sense close to the swallow. Decent balance, but no overt hopiness -- as appropriate. Since this is one of the Capital "premiums", I have to give it just OK marks on flavor, as its the most ordinary of the line of brews.","ADR","Dec 02, 2002"
