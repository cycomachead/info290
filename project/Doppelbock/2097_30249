Abv content on label is debatable, definitely a falsely advertised "big" beer. A great abundance of sediment at the bottom that's more than acceptable.

4.04,5.5,3,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, Winter 2011 vintage. Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a small foamy khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lace instantly. Ni glass lacing, and a fair amount of alcohol legs. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, licorice, dark bread, earth, light nuttiness, wood, and light bourbon. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malty flavors. Taste of big raisin, prune, dried fruit skin, licorice, toffee, molasses, caramel, toast, dark bread, leather, light nuttiness, wood, light bourbon, and earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, toffee, molasses, caramel, toast, dark bread, leather, light nuttiness, wood, earth, and light bourbon on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malty flavors; with almost zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial bock style. Great balance and complexity of malt flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 03, 2013"
4.17,8.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"(O)- Overall, if you like tons of licorice, this might be your holy grail. Despite that, I was quite impressed with how well balanced this is while still keeping it toned down in the thickness of what it could be as well as the expertly well integrated alcohol. Reminds me of a more balanced, less alcoholic Samichlaus.","sweemzander","Feb 01, 2013"

3.89,1.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep dark burnt brown and yes it has ruby highlights indeed. Carbonation is apparent from the bubbles I see, but head is not as it looks still. This is one opaque beer, held to light and can't see through, though it glows nicely. The aroma is faint, but contains some appropriate scents. Raisin, plum and brown sugar, vanilla and caramel. A truly distinct raisin, plum flavor / malt explosion. Undertones of cocoa are present as well. Some hop charecter is present, but faint. Slight flavor of alcohol and hotness. Mouthfeel is full but slick, kinda of oily. A truly tasty brew! A sipper to be sure. More carbonation would be nice.","pmlondrigan","0"

There's no booziness at all, and it avoids cloying sweetness. Finishes toasty, slightly nutty. Remarkably clean stuff. I'm impressed.","largadeer","Jan 22, 2012"
4.2,9.7,2,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I can say that drinkability was very nice, but there's some definite heat, none of which affected the flavour, but it did make me take my time drinking this, and I don't normally find most things boozy.

5,30.5,5,5,5,5,5,"I had the wonderful luck to try this beer fresh from the fermentation tank when the keg was first tapped and when it was half way through. The initial pours I had were phenomenal. The Munich Malts were so thick, it literally tasted like a milkshake and was grayish-brown in color, matching the maltiness. Weighing in at 13.5% ABV, you wouldnt even know you were drinking a beer unless you were told. Highly recommended!","90invjcc","Apr 15, 2011"
3.58,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Being that this beer is still super young, the beer looks like dirty mud water coming out of the tap, looks like it was taken from a swamp. A nice amount of swamp water head floats on top like a milkshake, some stickies. It looks terrible, but thats not the beers fault. it's intriging to say the least. Smell is alot of sweetners including brown sugar, some caramel, raisin and bread, it smells weird, but I cant stop sniffing it. Taste is on the sweet side with caramel/toffee influence and some English backbone. I get brown suga, whoppers, yeast, a splash of alcohol(estimated at 12-14%). Feel is kinda flat, the body has not came together yet, goes down like milk. I enjoyed this and am interested what an aged bottle of this would turn into. Much better than that Sam Adams creation by leaps and bounds, even at this infant stage.","BARFLYB","Apr 12, 2011"

4.44,15.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle. Pours a thick dark brown with ruby highlights and little to no head. Aroma is lots of sweet caramel malts, fruity, raisins, a hint of rum and a small hop note. Flavor is tons of molasses, plums, cognac. Very rich and satisfying with a warming finish from the big alcohol. Thick, sticky mouth feel with minimal carbonation.","punkrkr27","Sep 13, 2009"
4,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,3,"This is a solid dessert sipper and probably better than I was expecting given the reputation of "triple bocks." Sure, it's thick and not extremely drinkable but it's got a ton of flavor.","gford217","Apr 05, 2009"
2.88,-24.8,4,3.5,3,3,1.5,"12 ounce bottle courtesy of hoppymeal, thanks again for sending this Derek, 2006 vintage, last beer I split with Bill yesterday, color is a deep dark mahogany, close to two inches of light tan head that was pretty foamy leaves a small cloud later on, not much lacing though, aroma consists of port wine, caramel, toffee, booze, raisins, dates, sweetness, and rich sugars, flavor starts off quite sweet with various malts, sugar and dark fruits in the middle, finish is harshly hot with a big sweet aftertaste that lingers, wish it mellowed out a little as it warmed but that was not the case, too strong for my palate, sweet, hot, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, good amount of carbonation, taste lingered a very long time, had a hard time getting though five or six ounces myself, very strong and heavy, sweetness makes drinkability even worse, for being three years old already this beer still needs to age a lot longer it seems, brew is still quite hot with alcohol warmth, I will be the first to say this is much better than the only other triple bock I have tasted which is Sam Adams, would like to try this another three years down the road to see how it evolves and mellows, worth trying","Floydster","Mar 04, 2009"
3.9,1.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"D - The 6oz pour of this was plenty. The ABV is remarkably well disguised, but the buzz creeps up pretty quickly. The sour off-flavor also gets a bit distracting. I get the feeling that Triple (Trippel? Tripple?) Bocks may be too extreme, even for me.","MasterSki","Jan 28, 2009"
4.06,6,2.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Considering the amount of punch that this beer packs, I'm quite surprised and ultimately relieved that the malts aren't horribly cloying in an effort to mask the alcohol. When viewed as a drink for a one beer evening, it works very well, and is quite enjoyable.","EPseja","Beers"

4.1,7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Dark Heathen's very impressive. I've got a couple of small qualms with the nose and the body, but they're far from substantial. I am curious as to where the damn soy flavor is in this one. As a Tripple Bock, I was expecting some soy. ;~) All kidding aside. This is a damn good beer. Much more impressive than the Sam Adams Triple Bock, if you care to compare the two. Definitely recommended if you can find one. Thanks a ton, Derek.","prototypic","Dec 05, 2007"
3.76,-1.8,4,3,4,4,4,"Not sure if it's diecetyl or not. Still shows in the mouth but isn't offending at all. Malty sweet with hints of chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, date, caramel, and whiskey.

2.45,-36,4,4,1.5,3.5,1.5,"I've been excited to try this beer for a while and I was pretty disappointed with it. It was way too sweet for my liking. I struggled to finish the glass. Maybe the yeast tired out during the fermentation process and didn't complete their job. Overall this doppelbock is unbalanced. This isn't what I've come to expect from Kuhnhenn's. Oh well, you win some you lose some.","bozebus17","Jul 10, 2007"
4.54,18.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a somewhat foggy rich mahogany with a tiny half finger khaki colored head that immediately disappears after pour. No lacing left on the sides at all, but this seems to be pretty common for this style. Smell is huge caramel malts with tons of dark fruits such as dates, plums, cherries, and raisins. Brown sugar emerges as well with some hints of honey. For 13.5%, there is no alcohol in the nose at all. Sweet syrupy caramel goodness all over the tongue with a good dose of molasses. A bit of vanilla comes about as well with a warming alcohol flavor towards the end. Very interesting mouthfeel, just about no carbonation at all with a huge creamy feel to it. How they hide 13.5% is beyond me. If I had to guess the abv without knowing it, I would say somewhere around 7-8%. My first beer from these guys, and it won't be my last. Thanks again Steve, let's set up another trade :) Please?","BeerTruth","Apr 30, 2007"
4.44,15.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a ruddy red/brown, small tan head forms, no lacing, head disappears quickly, gone completely, pretty cool colour though. Smell is insane, very sweet, toffee, figs, chocolate, very rich malt, insanely caramelized, some alcohol, a beast. Taste is similar, very caramelized and figgy, toffee and chocolate, sugary malt, rich, full flavour, no alcohol detectable, hidden well, surprisingly light finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation, good warming, very nice! Kuhnhenn scores another winner.","Viggo","Feb 23, 2007"

4.08,6.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Sampled on tap at the Hop Devil in NYC for their Kuhnhenn night. The beer poured a dense brown color with a slight tan head that provided a nice little ring around the edge of the glass. The beer had a sweet, malty aroma with a slight hint of the high abv to come. The body was a nice big punch of malty sweet, caramel, honey and the big big abv. Some of the other Kuhnhenn beers that night masked the abv well but this one put it right out in front and makes for a nice full body and tasting beer.","ggaughan","May 02, 2006"
3.7,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Floral aroma. Scotch colour dark brown and malty scotch aroma. Blind tasting of the baleywine say it was an old ale. Sweetish spice in middle. A real style bender.
