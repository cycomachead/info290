Malty aroma with a bit of alcohol, raisins and dried fruit, biscuit and toast, slight sugary character. Really nice flavour, balanced combination of aroma characteristics along with mild to moderate bitterness. Malty throughout with bready and biscuity notes, grain and dried fruit, alcohol in the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation, smooth texture, mild warmth. I liked this quite a bit.

4.02,0.8,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Pours a slightly chill hazed reddish brown color with a fluffy beige head that persists forever. Caramel, molasses, dark burnt sugars and dark dried fruits, its a malt heads wet dream. Very light aromas of earthy hop provides almost no balance. The flavor is malty and rich with all of the aforementioned aromas playing a part in the flavor. Heavy molasses with a hint of smoke dominates the flavor while the other tastes add character. Rich sweet and frigging smooth. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly syrupy mouthfeel. Great Americanized version of a dopplebock.","johnnnniee","Jun 07, 2013"

4.11,3,4.5,4,4,4.25,4.25,"500ml bottle served in a pilsener glass. November 2012 indicated on the label. Pours a lovely copper hue with a fizzy, 2.5 inch tan-colored head with a translucent clarity and quite a bit of tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a rocky, quarter inch froth with residual spots and strands of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass as the brew recedes. Nose expresses grape bubblegum and some biscuity/wheaty notes. Taste follows nose; however, not as sweet as I would have anticipated; everything present in the nose coalesces nicely and leads to a pleasant balance. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and just a trace of oiliness to the texture. Overall, a very solid example of a style I'd like to see more of. Perhaps the best domestic Dunkle I've had (don't know why this is classified as a dopplebok). Alcohol is dangerously well-hidden as well. Wish these guys distributed in RI - thankfully I can easily cross the border to grab some.","Jwale73","Feb 28, 2013"

3.83,-4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottled, no date found. Poured a deep amber color into a lager glass. About two fingers of beige head. Slightly cloudy. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is earthy, malty, yeasty almost bread like. Not picking up any fruity aromas, maybe some caramel and toffee type notes. Taste is smooth malty sweet with slight bitterness. The word silky comes to mind. Nutty, a little bready, definitely earthy, and yeast character. Some acidity, maybe a hint of raisin or date notes. Very clean on the palate, light to medium body. Carbonation is moderate. Some aftertaste of sweetness once I finished the bottle - seemed to build up some. Very smooth, balanced, and drinkable even with the alcohol. Seems well hidden to me. Enjoyable, sure wish there was more than on bottle left on shelf.","LeRose","Jan 01, 2013"

3.73,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"O/D-Not my favorite from perhaps my favorite Massachusetts brewery but I will literally try every single beer I see on the shelf from Jack's Abby. The price-tag is always legit and the beer is even better. The true question is: would I like this beer more if it wasn't from a brewery that makes a few of my favorites? Or would I like it less without the respect that comes with the name on the label? I will never know.","VelvetExtract","Dec 28, 2012"
3.8,-4.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a dark and raisiny brown with light ruby notes and a big old light cream head that sticks around with light tight knit bubbles that are replenished rapidly. The beers body appears lager clean, but dark and fairly opaque. The lacing is medium width, sticky, and wall-like across the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of spicy raisins. Thick caramel malts are also present and slightly chewy alcohol. The caramel malts even turn a little roasted as you swirl the beer in your glass. The beer tastes surprisingly suppressed with spicy raisin and alcohol and light grainy cereal. The beer begins with spicy cereal notes before transitioning into sweet raisin and slight caramel and a quick burst of spicy alcohol before the tastes turns again to grainy cereal malts and slight biscuit and the faintest hint of roast malt and bacon. As the beer warms up and I drink it further I get more and more of a feeling of slight rauchbier characteristics in it, similar to Smoke & Dagger. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, and hits the stomach similarly. The mouth is left clean except for a slight scrim of spittle that wets the mouth for another sip. Overall this is a fairly decent dopplebock from Jack’s Abby. They hide the alcohol very well, but the thickness of the beer makes it a sipper (obviously…). It’s chewy and tasty, but it really doesn’t standout flavor-wise outside of the faint hints of rauchbier. It’s a good example of the style with some slight variations to add a “Jack’s Abby-flair” to it. A good beer for sure, and another wonderful offering from Jack’s Abby.","Maxwell","Dec 25, 2012"
