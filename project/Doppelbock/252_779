Taste was of molasses, burnt sugar, roast, and a caramel sweetness.  Mild carbonation with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel.  Overall, a very good beer, but, the dopplebock style never really works for me.","dpgoblejr","Monday at 04:48 PM"

The taste is amazing, perfectly malty with nutmegy and brown sugar notes. One of the tastiest and most balanced hyper-malty beers I've had. Mouthfeel is middle to heavy weight with a slight amount of "chew". Wonderful!","evergreen_machine","Mar 10, 2015"

It's not necessarily the flavors themselves but how they blend. The sweet, to bold, to bitter, progression of the drink is amazingly executed. This one is certainly going in my top 5 beers I've tasted.  It's a heavy drinking beer but damn if it isn't enjoyable all the way through.","Jaysauras","Mar 09, 2015"

There is a malty, brown-bread body to the flavor, with a dried fruit sweetness behind it all. It has all the richness that a dark beer usually has, but sits much lighter than it looks like it will. The feel is smooth, yet lightly effervescent. It pairs just as well with rich food as it does with drinking by itself. I'm not usually a dark beer man, but this I could drink pints of.","plaidowl","Feb 09, 2015"

The beer was a nice one with plenty of malt sweetness and dark fruits coming through, sure it didn't quite match the brewery's flagship hefeweizen but it was still a very nice doppelbock with enough going for it to make things interesting. A decent beer well worth picking up but it's not one of the brewery's best offerings, mainly because they have already set the bar so high.","flyingpig","Jan 19, 2015"

APPEARANCE: clear dark brown with ruby tint. persistent medium head of beige color. head retention reduced maybe because of high alcohol content. TASTE: rich malt flavour with slight notes of dried grapes. smooth impression from alcohol and no hop flavours. very low bitterness with malt dominating the flavour. PALATE: medium body with moderate carbonation. smooth without astringency. OVERALL: a very nice doppelbock with a médium smooth body.","titvs","Sep 06, 2014"

Color is a crystal clear strawberry red with the slightest brown tinge when held up to intense light. Thin, tan head, nice lacing. Aroma is yeasty, with roasted malt and caramel sweetness, with mild floral hops. Flavor is again yeasty, roasted malt, toffee sweetness, with a slightly piney finish. Mouthfeel is medium thin, and a bit foamy. This is a style that I do not understand (doppelbock), so I am rating it just as an enjoyable brew and experience. On that basis, I will say it is a very good to outstanding lager, well worth sampling. And this one has a bear, not a goat on the label.","Dsimenson","Jul 21, 2014"

Clear mahogany pour with a two finger beige head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is sweet and malty with hints of caramel, brown bread, toffee, leather, and subtle dark fruit and chocolate. The taste is rich and malty with tons of sweet brown bread and nuts along with hints of molasses, toffee, chocolate, raisins, coffee, tobacco, and leather. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with medium carbonation and a sweet, syrupy finish. Overall, a bit sweet for my tastes, but a flavorful interpretation of the style.","beerdrifter","Mar 05, 2014"

The first taste was heavy on the burnt malts and chocolate, and definitely stood apart from the doppelbocks I was familiar. The slightly sweet malts and coffee flavors come through on this nicely balanced beer. The Korbinian was deep and rich with a thick mouthfeel that stuck with the heavy bready brew. This is not a beer you drink quickly, but rather one you sit back and allow to consume you. The Korbinian was one of the best doppelbocks I have ever had.","brurevu","Oct 14, 2013"

Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, light pepper, nuttiness, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity esters and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big apple, pear, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, biscuit, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, light fruits, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of light fruity esters with a big dark malt balance; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent doppelbock! Great complexity and balance of fruity ester and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 25, 2013"

The aroma was malty with some grapey wine characteristics about the aroma. My initial impression of the taste was that it was too mild. It was malty, but too mild. The carbonation was modest enough to allow that taste to linger, but there was little to linger. The sides of the tongue are made away of a slight tart hop taste, but it is well masked. The texture of a doppelbock is pretty spot on, but the flavor is lacking. While this may be more true to the original version of the style, it does not stack up well against the modern version.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 07, 2013"

I'm a modern, rational guy and can admit such things. This was real sweet. Too sweet for me. If a woman tasted like this it'd be okay to me but not a beer. It's like when you make tea but put too much sugar in and you're already in the car so you just drink it but you're like tomorrow remember to put less sugar in. Had this out of a pint glass, after a Stone Espresso Imperial Stout. That's a beer for me. This tastes like something young people would like. I may be getting old.","mmmaaattt","May 10, 2013"

Originally cracked this open to offset the firey taste in my mouth from what I was cooking. Was taken aback as this wasn't what I thought it'd be. It was an excellent semi milky, sort of sweet, brown sugary brew. Brown in color as most bocks are there was a hint of malt in it, not the coffee, chocolate malt, but more of a toffee, carmely flavor. So smooth I didn't dare mix it with the rest of my spicy thai food dinner. Best doppelbock I've ever had!","Ryanm1","Mar 12, 2013"

The taste is sticky sweet initially with notes of cocoa, caramel, dark roast and nuttiness. Citric hops really gives this a green tightness that then begins to take over the profile and leaves this dry and bitter on the finish but the sweetness does pick up again as this warms. The feel is medium to fuller with a firm sharpness up front and then more of a smooth texture the rest of the way. Tiny bit of warmth but this drinks nicley for 7%+.

I hope that this has something to do with the Stark Fist of Removal as I have been very pink as of late with Oktober being Breast Awareness Month (Cancer) and I need more slack. No slack with respect to my pour, which resulted in two-plus fingers of thick, dense, deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with malt and I was afraid that it might be too sweet for my liking. Mouthfeel was thick, chewy and not as sweet as the nose had led me to expect. The taste was cocoa and dried dark fruits, This was a very smooth-drinking beer and I had swilled nearly a quarter of it before I came to my senses. Finish was semi-sweet, again, nowhere near as sweet as the nose led me to believe. This was, as the DME boys would call it, a "sneaky" beer. Proceed with caution!","woodychandler","Nov 06, 2012"

Nose was sweet with caramel and a little roasted malt. Very enticing. Taste followed up with more sweetness - dark fruit, a sweet bread taste and definitely some type of chocolate. The chocolate was a little muted and tasted like really good and mellow cocoa. Full bodied with good carbonation. Very easy and enjoyable to drink, and absolutely lived up to the hype. Already looking forward to a doppelbock taste test with a few other favorites.","Daktah","Nov 01, 2012"

A touch of prune or something also makes an appearance. The hops don't really do much, but the carbonation does a little something to balance it out. Moutfeel is a little chewy - not something I particularly liked in this case, though not bad.

4.53,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown, but not opaque, with a creamy tan head. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and chocolate. It smells clean and sweet and the alcohol does not come through in the aroma. The taste is fantastic. The flavor of dark roasted malt is very rich and creamy. It is mildly sweet like caramel and there is some chocolate flavor to this as well. The alcohol also does not punch through in the taste. Despite being so rich in flavor, the flavor is also clean and not cloying. The body is full and the beer is creamy. Your tongue let's you know you're drinking a big beer, but it's so clean in the finish that this is extremely drinkable. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. This is a doppelbock you should try if you've never had a doppelbock. It's very satisfying.","acevenom","May 01, 2012"
3.9,-7.1,4,4,4,3,4,"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has a great mix of fruit and malt. I get some nice cherry, grape and prune notes, as well as some heavy toffee. The flavor is very similar. There is a ton of toffee and caramel as well as some cherry and grape characteristics. The body is a little thinner than I expected, but it does have a very nice, clean lager taste. Medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Apr 29, 2012"

While I greatly enjoyed Ayinger Celebrator, this one is similar, but scaled back by comparison. Very sweet. Not much balance. I've found Weihensthephaner a powerhouse with their wheat beers, but this double bock doesn't quite make the grade. Not a bad beer overall, but I think the Ayinger has spoiled me in the Double Bock department. If I had to describe this one in two words, it'd be 'Sugar Beer'.","TheSixthRing","Apr 12, 2012"

4.33,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bought a 500ml bottle of this from a department store in Bangkok. Poured into a Paulaner weizen glass. A mysterious algae dark brown hue to the brew with not much of a head on it. The smell was a bit lacking in complexity for me, but it did have notes of caramel, wood, and chocolate in it. The taste was spot on for a doppelbock, serving nicely to a dinner of dark meats or with dessert. However, possibly due to its bottled form, I found this beer to be a bit overly carbonated, resulting in some initial excess gas. It also made my stomach gurgle for about a half hour after finishing the brew. Overall, I love Weihenstephan's brews, but when i'm searching for a doppelbock, I might look elsewhere. I'll stick to their hefes.","shigg85","Apr 08, 2012"

Not due to my intoxication level, but rather the pleasant subtlety of this beer. Good brown brew. Not a damn thing wrong with it, really.

Very nice beer and a little bit different from your average brew. I really like it, and it’s somewhere between easy drinking and too heavy for another one, making it a great beer to have a couple but certainly NOT a session beer that you would want to have a lot of, especially because of the alcohol content.","seesnow3","Nov 15, 2011"

Smells of prune, pumpernickel, brown sugar with a sweet, bright hint of a hops layer skimming the top. Flavor is great. The prune-ish fruit is well expressed but not dominant. Coffee and chocolate flavors are obvious. I also get spice and herbs: pepper, white pepper and mint really stand out. A near perfect mouthfeel makes this a real treat. Smooth with crispy carbonation that bursts a bit as it compresses for the swallow. It really sparkles for a dark, heavy beer. I'd almost say it's refreshing. It's a great accomplishment: the flavor of a bold beer with the crispness of a much lighter brew. High ABV is hardly noticeable with all the flavor going on. Just an all around winner.

When I took a good sniff of this complex beer I got a nose of roasted malts and dark fruits. The taste was similar to the nose of this beer. I tasted the roasted malts, the dark fruits like figs, prunes(i couldn’t really put my tongue on it) and some chocolate undertones. The mouthfeel is a medium to full body doppelbock that hides the 7.4% abv well. That makes it quite dangerous since I could keep drinking this. There is a medium level of carbonation.

Everything about this style was on point and about where it should be. It may not be as flavorful as some of the American ones but it makes up for that by being smooth as hell and having some great drinkability. I will be buying this again and will be on the look out for any other beers by Weihenstephaner.

4.18,-0.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Korbinian pours a deep brown, with plentiful cherry highlights shining through. The khaki colored head rises to about three fingers in height. It quickly dissipated to about two thirds of its top height, but some serious head retention kicks in from that point on. Lacing is decent, but just a little too patchwork to really finish off the look. The nose has sufficiently whet my appetite, a wonderful blend of toasted nuts and caramel. The flavor then manages to surpass my expectations by adding a distinct biscuity note to the nutty foundation, and bringing cocoa into the fold as a second auxiliary flavor to add a very nice flourish. I want to give it a perfect 5 for flavor, but I think a touch of dark fruits could elevate Korbinian even more. The body is impressively slick, and as pronounced as one would expect for such a malt forward beer. The cabronation though is a bit overdone, and I find it occasionally distracting from all the malty goodness. Weihenstephaner's crafted a great beer in Korbinian, it's one I'd gladly welcome back to my glass anytime.","axeman9182","Mar 09, 2011"

Smells very...hearty, like yeasty bread with caramel malts poured all over it, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Extremely prominent is the malt hinted at in the nose, but ultimately the flavor of dark liquorish dominates the taste, knocking out any attempt the bitterness makes to come through. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy with minimal carbonation and a little bit oily, which taken together is extremely pleasant. Almost tastes like a homebrew that hasn't completed its bottle carbonation.

Also some rum characteristics in there. Also has a caramelized brown sugar and date component. Really nice aromas and complex. The flavor has some alcohol burn, though it's integrated with the date and raisin flavors, like an aged rum. There is also a nice bit of malty richness to this that makes it very full bodied. Big mouthfeel, alcohol burn and dryness on the finish. Caramelized notes make this a perfect pairing for a grilled piece of pork or ribs.

Extremely robust aroma of heavy raosted malt, some mettalic notes, some molasses...Maybe even maple syrup. Pretty great smelling and quite spot on to style. Great flavor upfront. Very rich and full in the mouth. Great roasty punch in the gut, like watching Zito walk in two runs in the first inning of a title clinching game. Beautiful, but loses it near the end - unlike Zito who apparently never has it to begin with. Thin finish, and the unpleasant metallic notes show up more. Nice long, toasty finish - kind of like what the Padres will apparently receive after tomorrow night's game after the Giants choke and lose three straight to get the boot. If not for the thin finish, this would be great. As it is, it's merely good. decently priced at $2.99/half-liter so that brings the drinkability up some, and we're gonna need it after today's game...","SolomonGrundy","Oct 02, 2010"

The flavors were just the same and very tasty! I detected lots of caramel, molasses, maple sugar, brown sugar, hints of honey, hints of coffee, alcohol esters and a long roasty finish.

Despite the age on this particular bottle, it's kept its flavors remarkably (I had a fresh bottle a couple of weeks ago, and the differences were negligable). I've had this a dozen or so times, and it's been consistently exceptional. Korbinian easily ranks as one of my all-time favorite beers overall.

Dark fruits, prunes, figs, burnt brown sugar, a touch of alcohol about midway and a long lingering molasses and dark fruit finish. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, light to medium carbonation, thick body.

Much better than Troegenator, which might be the only other doppelbock I've had. Good blend of dark fruit with the toasted, bready malt that remains. A bit of brown sugar too.

4.33,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Weihenstephan ("holy Stephen") claims to be the world's oldest brewery. I can't be sure of that but I do know that dopplebocks developed near the brewery's location around Munich around the Middle Ages. If this brewery really is the world's eldest than good on them for continuing the production of the monastic "liquid bread" that sustained monks during their periods of fasting. No food but plenty of bock beer? Seems almost a fair trade...","biegaman","Apr 06, 2009"

4.12,-1.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured to a nice brown color that seemed to have some burgundy highlights, a good sized tan head that had quite good retention which left some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma of this one is very nice as bread and caramel come to mind, also though it has been imported it does smells fresh and I think that comes from a slight fruit aroma that is mixed in. The flavor is very good, malt is very dominant and has a welcoming flavor. Caramel and toffee come to mind with a backing of raisin or prune. The flavor does come out more as this brew sits and I sip it, though the alcohol does not seen to be noticeable to me or goes so well with the other flavors it is hidden. Overall this is an excellent brew, one I would get again and hope to have on draft at some point. Give this brew a try as it exemplifies the style.","Stimack","Mar 28, 2009"

Second, smooth more consistent flavor that is malty but better balanced with some leafy, earthy hops flavor. Third, 17oz for a good price, especially for an excellent dopplebock, so it hits the point on value. Last, the feel is the best around due to the uniquely low carbonation quotient. My favorite dopplebock.","argock","Feb 19, 2009"

Mouthfeel is near-perfect, with a velvety, medium body and well-crafted carbonation level, but a slight chalkiness keeps it from the "5.0" department. Overall, Korbinian is a delicious brew that thankfully shies away from the more booze-intensive notes other dopplebock's tend to favor. I'd certainly purchase it again.","wagenvolks","Feb 14, 2009"

Tastes of raisins and light milk chocolate,like Raisinette candy. A little caramelized brown sugar and light maple. Sweet and dessert like,good overall.

There are flavors of oak, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, nutty grain and soft yeasty dough. The finish is unobtrusively bitter. The beer coats the mouth pleasantly but never stickily, and the feel is velvet smooth. This doppelbock is very much bread in a mug with oodles of malt flavor.

Poured into a chalice a burnt caramel brown, with a thin sandy head which quickly faded to nothing, leaving speckled lacing on the inside of my glass. Aroma was dark fruit and malt, figs, raisins, reminded me of port wine. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, a little loose and slippery, with medium carbonation. Taste was full of dark fruit, figs, plums, dates, with a bit of a chocolate background and a slightly sour, vinous finish. Drinkability is high despite the ABV, due to the interesting complexities of the taste that kept me interested in identifying all the different flavors. Overall this was quite an interesting brew, and I may pick another one up to keep for myself.","ljbrisson","Sep 28, 2008"

The soy sauce thing carries through to the taste, something that is interesting but I'm not wild about-- ehhh. Saltiness in a beer is just a little strange, but I do like it sometimes.

A semi-creamy, smooth, medium-bodied beer that contains some sweetness thanks to roasted, chocolate, caramel and butterscotch malts (at least that's what I tasted) with a crisp, slightly dry backbite with some toffee and coffee malts.

Head eventually settled into a slick of foam that coalesced around the shoulders; no lacing adhered during the tasting. Scents of dark fruit, malt, toffee and molasses; nose was extremely complex and difficult differentiate all of the aromas. Taste consisent with nose; however, complexity seemed to strike a more even balance in the mouth. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light considering the bold nose and flavors. Not much carbonation present and alcohol was very well-hidden.

Good full bodied mouthfeel and decent carbonation level help add to the nice drinkability especially for a 7.4% beer. I'm a big fan of malty German lagers and this is no exception.

Being my first Weihenstephaner beer, I guess it is a good choice of a usher-in-the-new-year beer. OK down to business, this beer pours with a fairly large head into my Schneiderweisse Weizen glass; not the weizen style huge head of cos but a > 1 inch head that was creamily inviting. The liquid below was dark ruby brown in color. After the while the head reduces to a nice thin and clingy layer above the nectar below. The smell was not very strong but the malt aromas were clear with a nutty yeasty backing. I could also detect a dash of spices and maybe smoke somewhere and some caramel notes. The smell could really have been stronger than this. The taste starts off with a true malt strength with strong caramel notes and very subtle sweetness; I am also picking up spices (cloves) and a certain nuttiness here. The finish revealed some aromas of banana and some dark fruits and malts were also picked up on the nose. The after taste started off bready malty and with a fair amount of banana; it slowly reveals some notes of raisins before finally fading away. Truly a great taste which gets a little better as the beer warms. The mouthfeel was around medium body or slightly thicker with an apt amount of carbonation and nice creamy smoothness throughout; it finishes slightly dry. I pretty enjoy this beer; still prefer Belgian Dark Ales but this one really hit the spot for tonight. I prefer it to the Andechsers Doppelbock.","basica","Dec 31, 2007"

There was significant side glass lace throughout the session and the overall look of it was quite thick. The aroma was of slight smoked variety. A little bit of roasted malt with a touch of caramel to sweeten in up. The taste was remarkably smooth and delicious. Great full body on this one, definitely not thin. Nice and mellow smoky flavor with a huge earthy and bread like back. A nice caramel sugar sweet finish brought it all together. No taste of alcohol at all and overall it was a very easy drinker. I could have easily had another. The carbonation stayed very nice throughout the session. I would have to say one of my favorites so far, this was very tight and a fine brew.

3.84,-8.6,3,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer has been aging in Sam's storage for quite some time (Sam refused to tell me how long) as it has a completely different label than the current version of Korbinian. the beer has a hazy, dark amber color and is well carbonated, yet despite a vigorous pour did not summon forth much in the way of a head. There is a touch of a foamy, amber tinged ring around the sides of the glass. The beer has a soft, well integrated oxidation character to it; notes of sherry are definitely evident. The taste takes on notes of prunes, which are also noticeable in the nose as well. As the beer warms up a bit lots of flavors open up; notes of Madeira, sherry and fig become noticeable as well as a touch of chalky dark malt character in the finish. The beer also starts to become clearer as it warms. This has aged quite gracefully, certainly the flavors have softened and melded quite a bit, but this must be fairly old and it is still quite drinkable.","Gueuzedude","May 02, 2007"

Bready, caramelized aromas predominate, with a subtle spice character lending an almost meaty quality to the scent. Substantial on the palate with a dense caramel and dark bread flavor. Leafy and dusky-herbal hop notes come through near the back end. The taste culminates with a pleasant bitterness that is muted by the dark-bread sweetness mentioned earlier. Full bodied to be certain, with a smooth feel. A sharp-edged mineral presence in the water gives an overall dry feel to this otherwise rich and malty beer. Wonderfully complex and nearly perfect in its balance. As fine an example of a doppelbock as I've ever encountered.","orfeu","Apr 12, 2007"

It just seems more dominated by malt this time when before it was, of course, really malty but drank really easily. This beer is a bit earthy, but still really good. In saying all of this, I am not saying that this beer is noticeably flawed, but it just tastes a bit different than I remember it in the past.

Medium carbonation, a bit thin on the palate. Drinkability was nice, this brew has a good strong malty flavor, but the aroma turned me off a bit, and Dopplebocks are not my favorite style.

Light, warming alcohol is barely evident towards the end as well, particularly as it warms a bit.

The flavors are toasted/caramel/molasses malts, with a mild bitterness, anise, lots of sweetness that becomes cloying, and maybe some green/spicy hops - all on top of a medium body.

Complex nutty (pecans, walnuts), fruity (over-ripe peaches, dates, figs), maple syrup, and brown sugar flavors swirl over the palate with a heavy coating. Light hop bittering offers a light balance, but not flavor or aroma. The beer remains toasty and lightly roasted from sip to swallow.

Doughy malt flavor, that somehow manages to be incredibly strong without being cloyingly sweet. I think it is this fact that seperates the Korbinian from other hugely malty dopplebocks. There is some dark fruit flavor too. The finish is spicy. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Much more drinkable than you would think. I first had this beer when I was new to craft beer, and I wasn't impressed that first time. Revisiting this beer, I really enjoyed it. Weihenstephaner is now probably my favorite German brewery.","beveragecaptain","Nov 06, 2005"

Flavors of bready malts, mild smoke wood, a touch of cheese, and some grain. You have to really look for all the flavors, but they are there. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and mildly rich.

It pours out a deep plum brown with a phenomenal red glow that just looks magical. The head is fluffy white and sticky enough to leave residue. The aroma is bold and has a semi-strong alcohol sweetness to it. There is definately a presence of aroma hops that pull through. The taste is wonderfully sweet, but prefectly balanced out with some hop bitterness. The mollases body is full, but heavy. The caramel and raison flavors coat the entire mouth and the alcohol sharpness leaves a little warmth and burning. This is very drinkable and goes down remarkably smooth.

4.27,1.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The taste starts malty sweet with potent caramel, some toffee and a rising sweet chocolate. Caramel stands predominant throughout and aptly serves as a base that ties together the co-starring flavors to flesh out the story. Other early flavors I get are iron and pumpkin. Alcohol doesn't make an appearance until during the swallow and makes it's strongest presence known in the aftertaste. Another part of the aftertaste is a dry grassy hop flatness. It stands in contrast to the overall sweet malty theme and isn't particularly alluring. A resurgence of chocolate offers reinforcement to the malt sweet to make for an interesting battle. Body is medium, but there is a smooth creamy thickness. Good thing for these 'thick' qualities as they hold the malt sweet on the tongue during the aftertaste to tip the scale. Carbonation is moderate, perhaps working with the grassy and alcohol in the form of an acid sting during the aftertaste. This is a very filling beer, and it also kicked my ass (where's my pillow, it's time for bed).","mentor","Jul 30, 2005"

This was about $5 for the bottle, not bad at all, I thought to myself. Anyways, this one is a nearly opaque dark brown/black colour with ruby edges. Head is tannish brown and lasts well and leaves nice lacing. Aromas are all dark fruits and figs with super bready bavarian pretzel malts. To style, this one is pretty damn low on the German hops....but that's how it's supposed to be. Taste is malty sweet with complex dark fruit flavors like plum and fig, roasted nuts also come into the picture as well as dark sweet syrupy liquid sugar sources of various variaties.

Im going to let this one sit for a bit to warm*15 minutes pass*after warming a bit the subtle flavors start to present themselves. There is a pretty huge malt presence just as I expected. But it is balanced well with just a touch of hops at the end. The malts dont present themselves as overly sweet in this beer as I was expecting. Mouthfeel is nice and full and creamy to some extent.

Dark skinned sweet fruits rolled around on the tongue, and were backed by a smoky, woody, and herbal hop bitterness.

Creeping into the back of the aroma is an alcohol smell. The first taste is sweet and softits smooth, full of body, and very creamy. Its not so sweet that it becomes undrinkable, but its still not the kind of thing that I could drink all night. Nice warming by the middle of the glass.

No flaws in this one make it a very good Doppelbock to use as an educational tool as well as one to try and emulate in Homebrewing experiments. The mouthfeel is perfect as there is only enough carbonic bite to accentuate the hop bitterness without leaving the beer fizzy as well as the body being viscous enough to flow over the tongue slowly. Very drinkable even the high alcohol level would not deter me from having a couple of these at a time.

The taste is much of the same, rum, bittersweet cocoa, toffee, banana, with an ever so bitter finish, just the tiniest bit of hops profile peeking out to say hello, then jumping back in this vat of banana pudding. The mouthfeel is so creamy and thick, and the alcohol is so well-hidden, I could probably drink several of these easily in one sitting, out of liter steins, but I'd pay the price.

4.62,10,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Korbinian is one of the best made, richest, and most enjoyable doppelbocks made. Its clear russett body has a reddish cast and displays brilliant orange and ruby highlights when held to the light; and its creamy tan head holds very well despite its alcoholic strength, and even leaves thin sheets of lace at the outset of the glass. The nose, however, is possibly the most exciting part. It smells almost like fresh wort at the brewery. It's richly malty with a suggestion of caramel. The body is full; and its fine carbonation gently caresses the tongue before it fades smoothly away. Even bolder than the nose is the flavor. It's simply loaded with deep, rich caramel, toffee, chocolate and even a light cusp of coffee. There's some dark fruit present but it's not bold, and at times a hint of hop flavor can be detected. Otherwise it's exceptionally clean, not even showing its alcohol. It's exceptionally well balanced for such a rich beer as well, and its sweet malt seems to simply fade away in the finish despite the fact that it's bitterness is limited. Brilliant! It's rich and sweet but never cloying. Very well done indeed!","NeroFiddled","Jul 20, 2004"

Its very fruity and almost smoky, but actually not that spectacular after a few sips, earthy grape bubble gum if such a thing exists.

Caramel is the base malt and main flavor. Chocolate malts come and go as they please. I also notice a banana and slight clove taste at times. Hops are there to prevent this influx of malts from being too sweet and cloying. Yeast is prevalent and lends a dry mouthfeel. Alcohol kick comes in the end and trickles all the way down my belly.

3.68,-12.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Coppery-brown hue with a bloody influence, when I held it up to the light I noticed loads of animation racing towards the light beige head. Speaking of head, it reached an apex of a finger and a half in height; it then faded quickly to half a finger, then to a soapy cap that lingered throughout consumption. The subsequent lacing was very modest but discernible. The nose had its moments of impressiveness, sticky toffee, a hint of dark fruits, alcohol, and a strong dose of good ol maltiness. Behind these smells are notes of toasty-bready-caramel. I did find the bouquet to be a little airy. As a whole the aromas are pleasant, the potency is a tad lacking, nevertheless it is inviting. It took a few sips before the flavors really sparked any interest. Upfront on the palate I detected a malty, plumy, toffee combination, in the middle an average caramel noted emerged, also some chocolate pudding was added to the mix, in the finish the alcohol becomes noticeable, this was a lovely addition! The sweetness is really restrained; it is even a little dry. Without question the palate is tasty but it doesnt really standout like Urbock 23° or Samichlaus Bier, nor is it as yummy as SA Double Bock or Celebrator. This is no way a knock against Korbinian the competition is tough! The tummy warming affects are noticeable. Medium-full in body, the carbonation is low, the mouthfeel is quite soft and maybe even a little unexciting. I am impressed at the easy of consumption considering the abv, in other words it is very drinkable. I do wish this beer were available locally as it would be something Id quaff again. I purchased my bottle in Iowa City. This is a top ten Doppelbock but it doesnt standout enough for me.","bditty187","Mar 08, 2004"

Initial mouthfeel is tart and fruity, but quickly reverts to its strong malt character. Molasses, caramel, and dark fruits(figs and dates) are dominant here.

Taste is a bit more filling, starts a little weak and thin but begins to gain malty weight with a nice toffeeish sweetness and finishes strongly with a nice mixing of dark fruits of plum, raisin, dates, and figs giving way to a little chewy caramel lingering finish which is super smooth and creamy. Nice finish on this. Theres a bit of a metallic twinge in the midway parts but is barely noticeable and appears mostly at the front of the tongue and the lips.

Then it sort of dries up, with a roasted malt back end to smooth things over, finishing suprisingly dry for the style. Mouthfeel is full & thick, and this beer goes down easy.

The first sip reveals a full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is nicely sweet but balanced by a mild roastiness. Appealing fruit flavors make their appearances mid-palate, leading to a surprisingly dry hop finish with contributions from the hops and the not-insubstantial alcohol.

Flavor is light caramelly malts, no real hop presence but some odd funky spice. A bit sweet and syrupy. Mouthfeel is lively with constant steaming bubbles.","aracauna","Nov 25, 2002"
4.8,14.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Aromas of toasted brown bread and burned sugar carry through on the palate where they pick up green fruit, white raisins, muesli, flowers and both roasted and raw hazelnuts in abundance. Beautiful! The long, complex, shifting finish inspires images of spring rain on hot asphalt. This was leaner that the other two beers in the tasting, almost a different style, and my favorite. More challenging. Not "easy." A bit wild. But supremely engaging for the senses as well as the intellect. Let it grow on you.","putnam","Nov 20, 2002"

4.3,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"cloudy, brown and a ton of suspended sediment flecks floating around. minimal head....a bit of lace. a pleasant aroma of dark ripe fruits; hints of chocolate, caramel and spice. mega malty taste...not quite doppelbock territory but close. sweet toffee and chocolate flavors....some caramel too...spices and alcohol. oh yeah! we have a beer here! mouthfeel is a bit thin for the doppelbock leagues but it still kicks butt. pretty smooth and the malt load should satisfy any doppel lover. why these weihenstephaner beers aren't reviewed more and exalted...i don't know. i'm impressed by the sturdy character, balance and quality. if i would of known these brews were so good, i would have bought and reviewed them long before. what a pleasant surprise.","budgood1","Nov 01, 2002"
4.27,1.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Ruddy deep brown in hue, w/ a slight haze. Dense tan head recedes slowly and leaves lace. Nutty sweet caramel & buttery toffee upfront in aroma followed by notes of toasty Munich malt and mellow chocolate. Hint of fruity sweetness emerges at the end of the aroma along with a trace of cardboard from slight oxidation. A brash of molasses sweetness hits the palate at first, but immediately is ensued by rich caramelized nutes and subtle carob. Sweetness takes on a darkly fruity, raisiny nature mid palate. Moderate in body, w/ full dextrinous mouthfeel lent by the low apparent attenuation. Hop bitterness, although very understated, prevents the prominent malt sweetness from becoming sugary and cloying. Finishes with a hint of caramelized fruit melanoidins and more toasty Munich malt pleasantly lingering. Although a sweet brew overall, Korbinian wasn't at all cloying. The sweetness was initially molasses like, then took on a toffee character and ultimately became reminescent of dark fruit. A fine brew that would most likely be phenomenol if consumed fresh. Superb drinkability for the relatively high strength.","marc77","Sep 01, 2002"
4.5,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was quite a bit more taken with this bier than my drinking companion, BigE.  Amber with a thick head that left excellent lacing.  The aroma was big time MALT, with some spices and evident alcohol.  The malt couldn't hang with the big dogs in the taste department, as the spices and alcohol came through.  It was smooth with a slight sting of alcohol (what I expected from a starkbier).  Very drinkable.  Excellent.","ryanocerus","Aug 28, 2002"
4.05,-3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Notes: A tasty malt towering brew, makes for a great dessert or end of the night brew. Brewed in the old style of Dunkles Starkbier meaning dark strong beer, more or less can be classified as a Double Bock due to its massive maltiness and boasting an alcohol by volume of 7.4%.","Jason","Aug 21, 2002"

4.63,10.2,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"16 oz bottle. Another one that my little store always has for some reason. I have been saving this review for a while (he he he) Incredible rich chocolate brown color, with a fluffy medium head the color of Heidi Klum's um klums, klums.--uh oh....back to the beer. Super sweet malty chocolate taste that is just fine with me. Very rich full bodied beer, that demands you savor it. Full bodied and nice finish. It only lacks the slightly bitter balance of the celebrator. I wish more people would give it a try, it's well worth the effort.","StevieW","Jun 19, 2002"
3.3,-21.4,4,4,2,5,4,"Ok this has great flavor with the malty richness, ripe fuit flavor but I could not get past the sweetness. There is a big difference between malty and sweet. I me this beer seemed underatenuated. I think it was too sweet even for a bock. It has a lot going for it and if it was not so damn sweet it would be on the top of my list (specially at the price)  People are going to think that I do nothing but trash on beers but I call 'em as I drink 'em.","mattmaples","Oct 16, 2001"
4.84,15.2,4,5,5,4,5,"This ranks among the best aroma beers I've had.  Caramel, maple, toffee and a hint of chocolate.  The first sip was almost as good.  Lots of depth of flavor with caramel and roasted malts.  I hardly noticed the significant alcohol punch at 7.4%, which hides in a spicy finish.  Very nice.","Brent","Sep 12, 2001"
