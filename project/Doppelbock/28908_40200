Taste is a bit on sweet side, too.  Clean, smooth, tasty, decent texture.  Alcohol wasn't present much in taste.  I enjoyed it and would drink it again; in fact, I did order a second and my friend had three!  I would drink this as an easy social beer or in a restaurant with my meal instead of a Shiner or dark Vienna Lager.","marieli","Feb 17, 2015"

Harder to pull off, and earns my respect. Could be more complex, but I would much rather it taste good and simple like this, than compromise true flavors for increased "complexity". The original and classic German versions are better (than pretty much any American versions), but this is worthy of respect and I would drink it all the time.","allforbetterbeer","Jan 06, 2015"

I am really critical of this style as this is what I primarily brew and drink, but I regularly drink the classic examples. I live in Texas, where the origin of this mis-guided "Bock" characterization has occurred, so I am no stranger to drinking a Brown Lager that has the words "Bock" printed on the side of the bottle. You don't typically find that with a brewer that will print "Double Bock" on the bottle, but that is what you have with this beer. It is the same Americanized "version" of the Bock style, but the alcohol is cranked up a bit, so I guess they printed Double on the side. I will stick to my Weihenstephaner Korbinian and leave this on the shelves for someone who just wants a quick buzz with no real Bock flavor.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 31, 2011"
