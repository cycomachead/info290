4.29,5.1,4,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,"Poured a deep reddish-brown color, nice half inch head that receded to a quarter inch thick creamy foam. Aroma was sweet molasses, toffee and caramel with just a hint of dark stone fruits and some faint chocolate notes.  The flavor was pretty close to the aroma, with a very sweet flavor, some prune, plu, caramel and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel was luxuriously creamy and smooth, like drinking a glass of butter! This was an outstanding beer, but then again, it has been perfected for almost a thousand years, and it shows!","timontheroad","Mar 21, 2015"

Mouthfeel is medium.  Overall a nice example of the dopplebock style, not quite in the stratosphere with celebrator but quite good.","BrownAleBollocks","Mar 17, 2015"

Aroma is pumpernickel, toffee, brown sugar, banana, milk & dark chocolate, a little dark fruit & the faintest hint of earthy hops. Taste is  dark toasted bread, Hershey's chocolate, toffee, baked sweet potato, prune, raisins, figs & roasted nuts with some earthy hop character & a peppery spiciness in the sweet, fruity, toffee & lightly boozy finish. Aftertaste is char, chocolate & candied fruit mixed with a little hop bitterness that is accentuated by the alcohol bitterness, & spice.

I just wish it had as much body as it does flavor. carbonated well enough and very satisfying, save for a want of more body. its knit picking though with such a fine glass of beer. as authentic as they come, and one I will go back to at this price (in the 4 dollar neighborhood).","StonedTrippin","Oct 20, 2013"

Also present are treacle toffee and dry chocolate flavors to add a lower end to all those fruit effects riding up top. Very heavy sweet finish with some alcohol to yield a brandy effect.

I'm not going to say anything bad about this beer, but that's not enough to push any of the scores above a 4. It almost pushes past good in drinkability because it's rather easy to drink for a doppelbock, but that category also encompasses my eagerness to buy another bottle, and I can't say that this beer will ever make it into regular rotation for me.

This is quite good dopplebock. Whereas Sam Adams's version is bolder in malt and rich in flavor, Weltenburger is more subtle but a bit smoother and somewhat sweeter. The mouthfeel enhances this tremendously--very smooth and malty, a real treat. Sterling drinkability, easy to enjoy this mug's worth all too quickly.

When i first tasted it, i was struck by the chocolate and burnt flavors blended with a firm, but slightly understated background of hops. as it sat in my mouth, the flavors mellowed out to a slightly sweet coffee-like flavor with background notes of cherries. Even with so much flavor packed into each sip, the lighter mouthfeel for such a large beer made it very enjoyably drinkable. Altogether, this is one of the the more impressive german beers that i have had.","lrbradshaw","Jun 21, 2006"

But its mostly luxuriant creamy maltiness..I like it. Very nice on the palate a very full and pleasing mouthfeel.

The head was perhaps a fingers width, which slowly disipated to a thin patch. Sweet smell, without it being overpowering. Bitter dark chocolate, bready malts, caramel, toffee, bit of coffee and raw hide. I like it. Taste is great! Plenty of sweetness, but enough natural bitterness to not make it nauseating. The question is, does the bitterness come from the hops or the dark chocolate and coffee? Hmm... Something to ponder over. Mouthfeel is light, smooth and creamy. Highly drinkable.

It grows on me with each sip. There is a nice chocolate that comes out as I drink. If you like a good boch then I'm guessing that this is will do the trick.

The finish is beautifully lazy as the big malts and sweet spiciness mutate on the tongue to a more complex mix and the hops make this a semi sweet finish like raw bakers chocolate with fruit and nuts in it.. then the lingering after taste leaves the metallic hops on the back of your tongue to mingle with a detectable "warming".

Its creamy, yellowish tan head drops fairly quickly, but that's to be expected for the style. It does leave some minor spotty lace about the glass, but for the most part it simply maintains a thin, whispy surface covering. Dark, cocoa-ish malt and a combination of dark & red-berry fruitiness greet you in the nose. It's clean and inviting without a hint of alcohol. Brewed from an initial gravity of 18 degrees Plato, the body is medium-full and glides smoothly across the palate with a gentle caress from its fine-bubbled and slightly restrained carbonation. More chocolatey and dark toffee notes appear in the flavor and become more creamy and cocoa-ish at the swallow along with some quickly passing notes of fruit. Some nutty, deeply-toasted and almost roasty notes appear in the aftertaste as it's low-key bitterness begings to rise. It's rich and sweetish but extremely well balanced by an underlying bitterness that keeps everything in check. It never becomes truly bitter, but it does dry very quickly. Hints of black licorice appear towards the end of the serving. And although its alcohol is very well cloaked, some alcohol does appear later on, but it never build on the palate and only helps to dry the finish. Exceptionally well done!

In mouth, we're dealing with vinous chocolate and vanilla. It's the malt fest, beware! Very sweet, but restrained by underexpressed smoke. Medium-full body.

Overall, this is less distinctive than Salvator, but probably more drinkable overall.","the42ndtourist","Dec 02, 2002"
4.15,1.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer as it slides from the bottle into the glass a beautiful deep limpid ruby red color, the head modest and the leftover lace decent sheets that coat the glass. The aroma of peat and or smoke with the underlying malt and caramel sweetness makes it quite a treat to the senses. Start is malt and slightly sweet, the top skimpy in feel with the finish meaningful in it acidity, the hops pleasant and the aftertaste droughty and long lasting. A quite drinkable beer, and well worth the sampling, not the greatest bock, "Celebrator, Optimator, Salvator", top my list, but quite good nonetheless.","Gusler","Oct 20, 2002"

4.25,4.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"It's just plain brown. The head fades rather quickly. The smell is very nice, with traces of apple, raisins, toffee, and a just noticeable chocolate smell. This has a very pleasant array of flavors and a happy-making smoothness. Thanks again to all the monks.","mickeymac","Oct 01, 2002"

3.93,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Dark brown body, ends ups being almost black but is really like Okeefenokee swamp water but darker. Light chocolate milk head. Deep malt aroma - chocolate - and slight citric quality. Smooth malt flavors. The taste is earthy and gritty, but the mouthfeel is almost creamy and really smooth. This last part confused me: I picked up some esters in the flavor and by the end of the beer I was convinced I was drinking a weissbock.","aracauna","May 06, 2002"
4.51,10.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a dark ruby color with a huge, pillowy, dark tan head that leaves a nice lace on the glass.  Big malty nose with some nice dark fruit qualities to it.  Great bicuity maltiness that isn't too overpowering and cloying.  There is an almost earthy quality that I assume comes from the hops.  Subtle dark fruit qualities are present in the background, including a nice vinous character.  Great medium to medium full body without the cloying stickyness that I often associate with the style.  The less intense sweetness also makes this beer excellently drinkable for the style.  This is probably my favorite of the style so far.  It may not be quite sweet enough for some of the doppelbock purists but I could personally drink this one all night.","Murph","Beers"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A sublime doppelbock, with a beautiful chestnut brown color and appropriate fluffy head. It's quite smooth and refined. The hops are pleasantly sharp on the tongue but it's the malts that really give this beer character. Sugary, tangy with vague hints of cinnamon and dark rum, and the requisite doppel undercurrents of oats, apples, potatoes... Thinnish mouthfeel but gets nice and chewy and sticky as it warms. Subdued, mellow but with some real heft. One of the best doppels I have tasted.","Thrasher","0"
