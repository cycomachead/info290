3.68,-6.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not my favorite style to begin with, but a nice departure from Sam Adams' usual offerings.  Nice medium body.  Not too strong of a nose, but decently bready and malty.  Heavy on the toffee, brown sugar, cherries, malt.  While it's fairly sticky and syrupy in the mouth, the finish leaves something to be desired.  Maybe a little nutty and boozy at the end, but nothing that was begging me to keep drinking it.  Overall, a nice addition to the Sam Adams collection, but just not one of my favorites in the style.  If it's at your local bottle shop, it's worth a shot, as it's pretty affordable and may be a nice choice if you're into it.","futiledevices","Apr 01, 2015"

4.09,4.3,4.25,4.5,3.75,4.5,4,"This one has quite the shoes to fill, following a glass of the legendary Bavarian benchmark, Celebrator Dopplebock. Poured from the 22 oz. bomber into a nonic pint glass with perhaps a little too much oomph. After a brief cascade of foam over the side, it settles in to a towering, frothy cream-colored head. The interesting color of the brew only accentuates the appearance. Ruby red under the lamp, with amber highlights. A transparent mahogany in the shadows. In time the pronounced foam settles in to a patchy coating with consistent lacing all the way up to the rim. The aroma epitomizes that massive malt dopplebock bouquet. Bread dough with some faint molasses, soy sauce and fig-like esters. A touch of earthy minerals in the nose. The first sip brings a potent malt sweetness and a bit of a metallic twang. Boozy brown sugar flavors coat the tongue and finish with a slightly drying bitterness. A little toffee is present but this is not particularly complex. Not as earthy as I expected either. Mostly there's rock candy sweetness and enormous malt flavors. The mouthfeel is rich and hearty, a bit sticky. Full bodied. The carbonation is such that it helps provide a creamy texture. Given the high gravity of this one it's no surprise that a noticeable alcohol warmth is present in the chest. Maybe a tad cloying and a little stronger than I prefer for the style. Perhaps it's lacking some of the character of its Bavarian brethren, but it's a solid representation of the style. A worthy beer to pay tribute to it's predecessors and a solid nod to Sam for crafting another outstanding offering.","JohnnyI","Feb 01, 2015"

Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a standard Pint glass showed me a beautiful dark reddish brown pour with a 2 finger fluffy tan head which left nice lace as I sipped it down, the aroma is sweet and malty with hints of bread and brown sugar along with dark fruits. With the first taste I was happy I found another well made special beer by Samuel Adam's...they have many and I'm not a beer snob...so it's a winner. The medium mouthfeel sets up the malty sweet flow over the tongue, roasted malt and a rich bread round out the solid but fruity taste that hides the ABV well...and a hint of Carmel picks out at the end...a very solid Double Bock!","Bear1964","Aug 27, 2014"

4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/3/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pear, apple, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, pear, apple, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, pear, apple, biscuit, nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a excellent doppelbock! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of malt and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2013"

But, it is really not anything outstanding. It is neither a great representation of the style or an interesting variation on the style. Still, it is an enjoyable beer. Also, this beer has aged about one year. By now the alcohol is well-hidden and the flavors have had time to blend together. A year ago the first bottle in this four-pack had a flame-throwing amount of alcohol heat that overwhelmed all of the other flavors except for the sharp hops bitterness. This beer becomes a much better drinking experience with aging, but, I am just not sure that it is worth the wait.","Beer_Runner","Dec 02, 2012"

Poured into a pewter stein, took one sip. Wow! I can't believe a beer as complex as this comes from Sam Adams! I like several Sam Adams beers, but they usually are tasty/straight-forward and not complex. I taste at least 4 different levels to this beer. First off there is the sweet chocolatey malts, and man are they sweet. Next I hint just a tinge of dark fruit like the Rochefort Quadrupel I tried last week. Then more sweet malts, with less chocolate and more caramel. Finishes sweet as well. The mouthfeel is incredible. Not the thickest I have had, but excellent. Overall it is as close to chocolate milk as I can describe for a beer, without it being gross. Excellent. Only thing I would probably wish for is a little more of a head on the pour. One of my new favorites, although I must admit I am partial to the style.","Beer-TheThickerTheBetter","Nov 07, 2012"

As the bottle indicates this is very malty and gives off a sweet grain scent. The taste is kind of has a barrel aged, chocolate thing going on. Overall it is very sweet and drinkable. Definitely taste a little of the bitterness from the 9.5% ABV but it is very subtle.

Finishes pretty cleanly with a crisp light hop tone - probably Saaz.

The smell is of maple and caramel with a touch of fruit, maybe like strawberry and orange. The taste follows the smell well, strong maple and caramel, very sweet and smooth, I detect a slight alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is thick-ish.

The taste is very large and alcoholic, with fruits being the primary flavor. Honestly, it's a little too much for me and winds up tasting just a bit too "hot" in general. It doesn't taste bad on the way down, but it's really just too much fruitiness with too much alcohol. The mouthfeel is far too smooth to really be of note, and the drinkability is not very good. Overall, this is a beer that's just too big for it's own good. The fruit dominance just doesn't work with the huge alcoholic flavors that this beer presents. I'm usually a big Sam Adams fan, but this tastes a little too much like hot vomit for my tastes.","shand","Mar 18, 2012"

This is one of the best Sam Adams beers I've had, contrasted against a lot of safe, transitional beers they put out. Kinda pricey - not on an ABV per ounce basis, just on a per ounce basis. I'm not drinking to get drunk, so ABV is incidental and it's pricey when a fourpack costs the same as a sixpack would.","BrownNut","Mar 01, 2012"

3.67,-6.4,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Appears a dark mahogany color, no visible hazing, with a short-lived soda fizzle sand colored head that leaves minimal lacing behind. At the moment of popping the cap, there is a very strange initial burst of pineapple upside-down cake aroma that settles back down, eventually content to be in the background of the multi faceted malt aroma. (bready, yeast, caramel, toffee) Flavor is a sweet brown sugared and hearty raisin bread buffet with some small amounts of drying alcoholic heat in the finish, although not quite as boozey as, oh say, a barleywine would be, it still has some mild hotness to it. Texture is smooth and silky as it ought to be, but that hotness does distract ever so slightly. Very slightly under carbonated as well for my preferences, but only just barely so. For me, this beer was like a flawed or poorly cut gemstone, in that it was a thing of real beauty unfortunately marred by a couple of imperfections.","WastingFreetime","Feb 18, 2012"

Pours medium brown with a reddish tinge along with a thin off-white head. Very malty aromatics, some notes of apple juice, slight whiff of alcohol, and a nice brown sugar note. Full malt flavor along with some apple juice and brown sugar as well. Malty with a nice warming finish and crisp mouthfeel.

A good mouthfeel on the tongue velvety smooth and a bit thick with combo of sweet malt with the alcohol present as well. Malty goodness but was surprised how this reminded me of an english barleyine or wee heavy with the combination of sweet malty thickness and evident alcohol presence, where as with a Dopplebock I was expecting a bit more carbonation to balance the sweet malts and alcohol.

Very balanced, and I really don't get any of the 9.5% ABV in the smell. I get all the smells in the taste profile as well. It's a little on the sweet side for me, but this is a nice tasting doppelbock! Very rich, bready feel, with a slight alcohol burn on the aftertaste. The feel is not quite as refined as the taste, it's a little out of whack. Overall, this is a surprisingly good beer from Sam Adams- it's a little boozy on the aftertaste, but I generally like that.

2.51,-36,4,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Overall I thought this Doppelbock wasn't that good and it had too many harsh qualitys for me to like. As far as sweet Doppelbocks go this is up there with being one of the sweetest Doppelbocks I have had to date and combined with the lack of hiding the 9.5% of alcohol made for a beer that was pretty hard for me to get down and not all that enjoyable. I don't mind sweetness and booze in a Doppelbock and I have come to expect it from this style, but balance is the key and this beer showed hardly any balance. What I liked most about this beer was the look, it had great color for a Doppelbock, what I liked least about this beer was it's unrefined and unbalanced taste, it was just too sweet and boozy. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'll stick with my go to Doppelbock, Celebrator. I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone, unless sweet and boozy is your thing, it's not hard to find a much better Doppelbock. I find this beer to be a swing and a miss for Samuel Adams, it lacked the balance and refinement that better Doppelbocks have, this beer needs a good amount of tweaking to be good, it's just too rough around the edges. I still want to try their Imperial Stout but this beer made for a bad first impression for Samuel Adam's Imperial Series. This is the second worst Doppelbock I have had with Primator still remaining the worst to date.","StoutHunter","Jul 17, 2011"

First sip dripped sweet caramel malts all over, rich and deceptively smooth.

3.62,-7.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste, a nice deep malty profile with a somewhat thin body compared to something like a celebrator. Way way way too high of hop profile for the style. I'm not sure this is really a dopplebock, but a misguided american interpretation of something else. You get burnt sucrose mostly on the nose with caramel and maybe some brandy notes as the alcohol is apparent. Not super complex pretty straight forward on the tongue from front to back with the nuances of the malt profile masked by the bitterness of the hops. i guess since it is a kettle burnt malt profile and a simple grain bill, that is the reason for lack of depth and texture. Just burnt notes and caramel sugar and booze mostly. Not horrible, but not really a great example of the style. I guess archetype of the style isnt what they are going for here since it is an imperial at 9.4% and I guess thats the best part of it all since what it leaves off from its far cry from spectacular it makes up in bold punch. If you want a deep rich thick on the tongue creamy syrupy mouthfeel like the world class dopplebocks, this definitely isnt it. If you dont mind the over hopped american's interpretation plus the imperial boldness you will like this. Even though they used thier standard american lager yeast, it could easily pass as an American Strong ale, even though it is a lager as that is really more of what this is in taste and profile. The american ale yeasts really dont put off much in terms of phenols or esters to change the complexity anyway. It isnt super boozy for what it is and sure will relax you relatively quickly. I personally wouldnt revisit as this style makeup isnt my preference.","lifeboyq","Mar 31, 2011"

The alcohol is actually very well masked. I had this beer last year and thought the alcohol was more noticeable.

Before I get another email from a fellow BA like I did for my review of Glissade, I will state that this was a solid beer. Just not outstanding like I remembered. The appearance is dark brown with a little head. I didn't get much aroma. Maybe a little malty sweetness. The taste is also malty sweetness. It's smooth, just not very tasty overall.

It pours a fairly carbonated deep red, with an inch of frothy head that eventually falls to a fine lather and leaves a few wisps of lacing. Smells sweet and caramelly, with a hint of cherry. Tastes very rich, but in the wrong way. There are loads of raisiny and caramelly sweet crystal malts and none of the toasty and bready Munich malts that mark a good dopplebock. Sticky and full body, thick and smooth, but it could use some more carbonation. Easy enough to drink, but this is too sweet and not malty enough to make for much of a bock.

That same tell-tale peppery alcohol is a warning to not take this beer too lightly. The syrupy mouthfeel tends to slow drinking down quite a bit and the beer only gets more assertive with each degree gained in temperature. Not a sipper in terms of assertiveness, but certainly a beer to respect and take the time to appreciate. The full-bodied complexity limits it's pairings, though it's quite good with spiced - and even spicy - sausages provided you go easy on the condiments. Try a bratwurst with some grilled onions and a dab of mayonnaise on a roll alongside and you'll see that sometimes, simple is best.","TheMadJack","Oct 31, 2010"

Damn, this is complex, raisins molasses, brandy, dark malts, milk chocolate(a rarity in beer), dark fruits, figs, and vanilla are just a few of my initial of impressions. Carbonation levels are on the medium side, very smooth. A very drinkable beer for something as complex. I am very impressed with this offering.

The nose comprises caramel, blackened biscuits, honey, and that English-style toffee we always hear about. The taste mostly holds true to the caramel and toffee, along with some less-burnt biscuits, figs, and a light touch o' booze. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and an almost chewy (gummy, perhaps?) feel.

This brew poured to a nice brownish amber color, with a thick light tan head that had excellent retention and left real nice lacing. The aroma was a great mix of malts - roasted, caramel and slightly biscuit like. Also present where brown sugar, alcohol and dark fruit aroma's that mixed so well with the malt scents, made it smell rich and very inviting. The flavors where just as good as the aroma - malt flavor is just perfect, caramel like with a slight roasted property. Warming alcohol that is there just to accompany the flavors, in no way burning. This brew turned out to be a delight, it really hit the spot on a cold night.

I still haven't figured out how you can make a rootbeer float look like beer. Sam did it here. Everything about this beer including the hops is drenched in sugary syrup. Mouthfeel is sticky sweet.

The nose seems a bit one-dimensional with a malty sweet brown sugar note with just a touch of dark fruit mingled in. One dimensional, but good. The flavor on the other hand seems to explode with depth. The premise is basically the same as the nose but with a whole new layer of complexity. Chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, dates, figs, and a bit of smoke combine to make this an excellent doppelbock. The mouthfeel is all of full bodied with a minimal carbonation that suits the beer well, goes down extremely smooth and leaves a slick yet drying finish. Overall, dangerously drinkable with the deceivingly high ABV. Try this one for sure.","gmfessen","Jan 19, 2010"

Nice mouthfeel to this one though, lighter body than I expected and some great dark fruit taste to it.

Quite aggressive alcohol with a hint of green hop bitterness. Honeyed sweetness with some molasses. Overall, a malt and alcohol bomb that's sometimes a bit over-harsh. Full bodied for the style.

A bright copper brown poured with a 1-2 finger light beige head releasing a sweet malty aroma with marshmallow & hints of Concord grape and cloves. The taste was a bit sweet & cloying with the cloves & a mild-smoky Scotch ale and cherries with the slightest hops-watermelon note..

With only a half-inch left, there's still a sheen of foam on top that few beers can boast. The flavor is pure and malty without being overly sweet. True to the style, it's not too hoppy but it is well balanced. And did I mention the alcohol kick?

The smell is of sweet malty goodness with maybe a little hop. There is also present a little whiff of alcohol in the back of the nose. The taste is luxurious malt with a slight toastiness and maybe a little nuttiness. These earthy flavors are balanced well against just enough hop presence to keep it crisp, and the final warming alcohol in the finish. A truly great beer that is rich and complex, and yet dangerously drinkable for its 8.8% abv. The perfect early spring beer.","Godot","Apr 27, 2008"

It had a mixture of different flavors including sweet honey, raisin bread, sour apples, and bitter cranberries. It was oily with some carbonation and had a sweet and tart aftertaste. Overall this beer seemed almost like an old ale that could be aged to bring out even more refinement. But currently, it's a very clean and complex drink that's well balanced with enjoyable flavors.

In terms of scent, the first thing that popped into my mind was "sugary." I'm thinking caramel and dark fruit (raisins, plums), as well as the presence of malt as the backdrop. Taste similar to nose (no surprises here). Full-bodied mouthfeel accentuated by the slightest bit of carbonation across the tongue. Alcohol is very well-hidden; I can't believe this is an 8.8% abv.

Not as many chocolate notes as in previous years, but very smooth, with a bit of an alcoholic kick in the finish. Always a big time malt presentation, this one does not have the citrus notes of one produced ten years ago when it took on English strong ale characteristics. Nevertheless, this year's version is beautifully smooth, with an ester note of bannana bread, along with caramel and chocolate. Outstanding beer and reasonably priced.","thebeerdoctor","Jan 31, 2008"

The aroma is of caramel apples, with hints of cherry and milk chocolate. The taste is full of caramel with a crisp malty finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy texture and nice, low carbonation. Overall, this is a very interesting doppelbock. It is bolder than most other doppelbocks I have had, yet it doesn't have the cloying sweetness that a lot of American versions of the style tend to have. I can easily see myself drinking this beer again.","KarlHungus","Jan 28, 2008"

Poured a dark amber red with orange tones when held to the light. The beer had a off white head that disappeared quickly. Aroma is amazing. Lots of dark fruits, with brown sugar, caramel and cherries. Taste is roasted malts with brown sugar, dark fruits and a alcholy kick. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a light carbonation.

Brown-amber colors are the general colors seen in this drink. The smell is great; thick, thick malts and spices. The taste is out of this world: pure sweetness with sharp bitter-alcohol tastes that are more delicious than overpowering. The mouthfeel is awesomely perfect for this drink since it allows the beverage to be thin enough so its not like a meal for some people. Is this the best doppelbock? No, but with its very above average dimensions, this Sam Adams staple is one of the best in their repertoire.","fitzy84","Dec 13, 2007"

It pours rich and reddish brown, producing a thick tan head that lasts well through its consumption. It is extremely rich in flavor and taste, with chocolate, caramel, and berry malt all in a magnificent roasted melange. The malt is heavy but not obstreperous, allowing the other flavors to emerge as it's consumed. It finishes as smoothly as it begins. A genuine treat, one of the best dopplebocks around.

Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's also syrupy, slick and a bit heavy. Leaves a nice coating in the mouth. Drinkability is good, the beer is smooth and not hard to drink at all.

It's remarkably full-flavored, unlike some other "doppel bocks" on the market; and it's really nicely balanced to display its maltiness, rather than alcohol, bitterness, or hops. There are some spicy and grassy hops to it, but they don't really compete with the malt up front, they just keep it in check. They do, however, show themselves at the swallow and into the lingering, surprisingly soft finish. Alcohol is present as well, and once again, unlike many other examples, it's kept well in-check. You know it's there, you can feel it in the mouth, and taste it amidst the malt, but it's not really obvious until the finish - it works with the bitterness to dry the sweetness of the malt, and it's quite nicely balanced from start to finish, never becoming cloying or sticky, and never becoming hot or overly bitter. Very nicely done! One of the best doppel bocks on the market.","NeroFiddled","May 27, 2007"

I am also smelling a little bit of yeast in there. I am surprised by the fullness of flavor. Strong, sweet malty overtones with a hint of hops and yeast in the background to keep it balanced and to take the edge off of the thick, sticky-sweet body. The alcohol adds a sharp, yet fitting, bite. This is a pretty mean beer and it's beers like this that make me appreciate Sam Adams more and more.

Some candi sugar and nutty flavor round out the taste, and the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, almost chewy.

Sweet and syrupy malt base, with a bit of toasted bread-like flavors. Monochromatic under the alcohol. Mouthfeel is full, syrupy, and light on carbonation, a winner here, and who could argue unless you crave more carbonation.

As this is a lager, this was all presented with much more smoothness in the mouth than is ever possible in a stout or a porter.

I get tones of caramel, nut, and red apple skin but all of these cower on the palate before the sugary-sweet presence of this cloying malt-bomb. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy-sludgey.

3.95,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Im always amazed at how Sam Adams does such a good job of brewing beer in spite of being a larger brewer. Double Bock is no exception. Poured into a pint class at 54 degrees, a fluffy, yellow snow colored head (sorry for the analogy) sprang up about a ½ inch thick, but dissipated rather quickly to only faint traces on top the dark brown beer. The 8.8% alcohol shows through easily in the smell, overwhelming any hop note. Alcohol is strong in the taste as well, blended with lots of caramel malt flavors. Very sweet overall, easy to drink for a strong beer. Nothing very harsh or overwhelming. Compared to other doppelbocks, a good introduction for a friend who is scared of hops but ready for a well made strong beer. Smooth mouthfeel makes it accessible, and very drinkable. Not much to be afraid of while doing a very good job. Hopefully, large breweries will notice that such beers are possible and supported on a wide scale. If on the menu at a regular restaurant, Id order it over standard fare easily, but probably before or after the meal or bring a six pack to a friends.","FightingEntropy","Apr 16, 2006"

3.85,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Opinion: This DoppelBock is quite a bit different than the majority of those you find in Germany. For a beer that has this much girth, there is a very mild specialty malt presence. The same applies to the hop presence as this beer definitely lets the malt run the show. It is on the balance between Paulaner and Spaten. I wouldn't say that it was a contestant to either one, but still splitting the difference. It is an OK beer, but it doesn't really stand up to the true German styles.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 26, 2006"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Best before October, 8.8 % ABV. Pours a clear, reddish brown/mahagony color. Thin tan foamy head disappears pretty quick. Caramel, dark fruity and alcohol aroma. Strong caramel, toffee, and slightly fruity flavors. Slight bitterness at the end is followed up by alcohol warmness. Full body, almost chewy, with low carbonation. This is big and bold in comparison to most other Sam Adams beers. Very nice, and certainly a bargain. I like it.","Bierguy5","Mar 25, 2006"

Smells very meaty. roasted malts come across like lump charcoal with estery notes like cherry. The hops add a little to the nose, lightening the other aromas and lending some balance. Very good taste to this one. The flavors meld into a fruity sort of flavor...like berries. Balanced well with the caramel malts and light taste of hops in the finish. Medium to full bodied, a little syrupy. It feels strong, but isn't alcoholic. Just enough complexity to enjoy, but I'd rather enjoy it with a meal.","cracgor","Mar 15, 2006"

A beautiful brown / ruby hue with a fleeting, white-ish head. Very sweet and very bold aromas that take on a molassas, syrup, nutty quality. Lowly hopped for maximum preceived sweetness. Tastes sweet and thick up front with a hiding alcohol content that comes through only in the dry, tacky finish. Barley malt, nuts, and toffee flavors remain persistant from beginning to end. Bold enough to counter the sugar sweetness. A bite-ey graininess hangs up in the back of the throat that compromises the drinkability, but not enough to ruin the beer.

Mouthfeel is thick, you can practically chew this beer. There's a hint of hops hiding in the background to offset the sweetness, and the alcohol is barely noticeable, just a slight burning sensationon the way down.

In the mouth the beer is sweet, with a bit of bitterness--perhaps from the 8.8% abv. Carbonation seems perfectly balanced.

The taste is very sweet, lots of toasted caramel; and a fruity ester hiding behind all that delicious malt. The aftertaste is a touch dry with some faint noble hops that I felt were not enough to balance the sweet flavor. The carbonation is at medium level, and makes a smooth mouthfeel in a truly full-bodied beer.

4.43,13,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"12 oz bottle purchased from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and has a freshness notch of July (consumed late-May 2005). Hard pour to get a thin red-tan head over a dark red (and crystal clear) liquid. Smells of caramel, like those caramel squares people give out for Halloween. Beneath is a gentle chocolate, some alcohol, and faint weedy smelling hop. Smells sweet and enticing. Tastes alcoholic over a sweet caramel with a nice chocolate character. It's got a creamy mouthfeel that, combined with the wet sweet, allows the chocolate to come across as rich. The alcohol, while noticable, isn't unbearingly strong. The carbonation is a bit more than I would like and I'm missing the 'bock' in this bock. Did they decoct mash this?...I'm guessing they just used a bunch of crystal malt to try to get the same effect. At first I was missing a munich character to the malt, but with searching I do detect it as a dry malt beneath the alcohol, sweet and carbonation. I can't place the hops, because the floral that rises in the throat battles with an alcohol sting. Altogether, pretty nice. The alcohol may settle with a bit of aging and I'm sure the malt would meld nicely, too. The head never quite settled to a ring around the liquid and there was some lacing on the inside of the glass. As the beer warmed, the malt smell dominated the alcohol (thankfully) and the caramel character rose more prominently in the taste. What a delighful mouthfeel. Thick and creamy, like an oatmeal stout, but a gentle alcohol burn keeps you on your toes. Oh, I'm liking this more and more (plus the alcohol is noticable inside my head now, too).

This beer is all about the maltyness. Very thick in body and rich in taste. The malts begin with caramel in flavor but a dry maltyness follows that. Butterscotch becomes more prevalent the further I go. A smoky woodsy flavor hides in the background and keep this beer from being too cloying, but it's still slightly cloying as caramel takes the show.

4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is my favorite brew from Sam Adams. Pours a deep reddish brown color with a nice head. Smell is rich, malty, with alcohol, fruits and a bit of sweet spiciness present. Taste is brilliant, with a rich malty sweetness that perfectly balances the high amount of alcohol present. You'll notice the alcohol, but it balances out so well that you won't care. Buttery toffee like finish. Very warming, satisfying beer. I wish I could get my hands on some more. Guess I'll have to wait until next year.","ChrisBowers","May 18, 2004"

The pour is dark red mahogany with a thick tan head and medium lacing down the glass. The smell is of deep, overripe fruit and candied nuts, sugar and alcohol. The taste is thick and very rich, decent carbonation and heavy duty sweet malts just overpower the senses. There is a smell of almost tree bark, earthy, old, heavy duty engine oil... I like it. This definitely has the most character of any Sam Adams brew I've ever had. The alcohol is like another flavor in this one and I like it --- couldn't drink more than one or two, but it's nice and I could see buying this once a year along with Victory St. Vic as a comparison.

The flavor was great with a huge malt carmel sweetness and a great breadyness as well. The 8.4% alc was hidden quite well and just slightly snuck into the flavor profile.

The head on this beer is almost non-existent. It is also MUCH sweeter than I remember it being and less full-bodied. The sweetness is almost overwhelming but it definitely does calm down a bit after it warms up.

Beer is dark copper in color, yet highly transparent, with amberish highlights and a handful of streamers. Smell is very sweet and malty, with an almost candylike caramel quality and a toffeeish finish. Nosefeel is just a step away from being pastryish in the body but finishes vaporous (as of alcohol) and approaching bitter. Taste begins with firm, sweet caramel malts that are quickly pushed aside by hullish barley; somewhere there lurks a hint of grape (which, with the alcohol, had me thinking "cognac??" halfway through the bottle); finally a big, inappropriate (IMO) bitterness as of alcohol plus Hallertau gone wrong. The flavor transitions are smooth but not complex. Mouthfeel is tingly, a bit thin, and sticks to the palate like cola. Where's the creaminess of the great doppelbocks? I actually drank this faster than I felt I should, in order to get it down before the sweetness faded away. Drinkable, but lacking in depth compared to many other widely available examples of the style.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Mar 11, 2004"

After my initial taste, I was strcuk with how much this reminded me of wine, but with a nice mouthfeel witha lingering full-bodied aftertaste. Very smoth going down (but sip, don't gulp).

Taste is very sweet and malty caramel upfront with a long, sweet finish thats slightly dry and hinted citrus. Feel is medium bodied with low carbination and lends a sweet twinge in the mouth, could use a bit more roasted body I think. A pretty good effort by Samual Adams non th less, and is one of their top beers along with thier Scotch Ale & Octoberfest. It's not as good as many of the German doppelbocks, which conquer all. This was a little too sweet, needed to be more deep, robust, and roastier.","tavernjef","Apr 03, 2003"

SA double bock packs a punch so be careful. whoever noted that this brew is a "boozy amber smackdown" hit it right on the head. while not as flavorful, complex or complicated as the other heavy hitters in the doppelbock leagues, this one holds it own by way of brute force.","budgood1","Mar 11, 2003"

Taste begins with rich caramel notes, followed by dark fruit notes, then sweet alcohol, and finally some mild hops. Alcohol is very warming.

WIth full syrup flavors of figs and almost a mild brandy this beer is amazing. A standard in double bocks, definitely incredible in the amount of malt. A beer that is 8.4% purchased in WV was a dream come true, and I felt like I was being rebel breaking the law. It was sweet, then I realized they labeled the bottle malt liquor , and that might be why WV can import the Sam Adams Double Bock. A full mouthfeel that fills you up, nice and chewy.

When I drink Optimator, Celebrator or Salvator, Im not left with as much heat in my stomach as I am with Sam Adams rendition. The classic German versions also show more finesse with their strength. This is a complex brew and I found it to be pretty enjoyable, but I wouldnt want more than one.

Dark amber in color, this viscous fluid makes a grand desert beer or a topping for ice cream.

The aroma is comprised of candy - like sweetness coupled with toasty Munich malt and is reminescent of caramelized sugars and fruit.  The only elements lacking in aroma are the complex melanoidins provided by decoction.  Otherwise, it's quite appetizing.  Although quite bubbly in appearance, the brew is perfectly carbonated, the mouthfeel is very smooth and it's  quite full bodied.  This brew is definitely a sipper.  Although very sweet, almost sticky sweet, there's enough rich malt complexity to keep this brew from being cloying and one - dimensional. Hop bitterness is paltry and doesn't even come close to balancing the malt sweetness.  Finishes w/ a lingering toffee sweetness and pleasant alcohol warmth.  This is a fine brew.
