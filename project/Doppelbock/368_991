4.25,4.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Aroma: slight fruit, bread, sweet malt, strong malt aromas, slight toast, light caramel, no hops, fruit is grape, no roast or burnt malt. Appearance: Brilliant deep copper, off white fluffy head but low retention, ruby highlights, not a lot of lace but some legs. Flavor: rich malt sweetness, a little alcohol that shows up especially in the aftertaste, some hop bitterness in the background for balance but overall leans to the malt. Pleasant mix of alcohol, and malt, long malt after taste. Mouthfeel: Medium full body, medium low carbonation, slight warming, creamy, smooth. Overall Impression: very drinkable, not cloying, smooth, strong and rich.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

Pours a clear, dark copper, almost mahogany, with a fairly thick light wheat head. Malty flavor has firm earthy, caramel, and honey tones with just hints of spice and wood. Texture has decent body and fizz, leaving an earthy, slightly woody finish and a persistent tingle. Happy Autumn!","Cyberkedi","Jan 04, 2015"

4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light chocolate, slight tobacco/leather and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark fruit and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light chocolate, slight leather/tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, light nuttiness/chocolate, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of big dark fruit and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/dark fruit balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome doppelbock style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of big dark fruit and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

The taste was very fruity, brimming with flavors of cherries, and fig, as well as showing off some vanilla, toffee, and just a hint of chocolate. The body was thicker than medium dense, with sticky initial feel, and a dry finish. I believe this is the first beer from this brewery I've sampled.

I was a little disappointed with the aroma as it was more faint than anticipated. Sweet malts dominated the aroma. In the initial taste, one tastes the sweetness of the malt like a sweet bread. A sour note hits the side of the tongue while darker fruits dance in the background. There is a hint of carbonation in the background. Molasses and dark chocolate develop as the initial taste matures. In the aftertaste, the taste sours while coating the back of the throat nicely. A slight warming sensation can be detected. Capital does doppelbocks exceptionally well.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 12, 2013"

Taste is mild caramel malt, raisin, finishing with some breadiness/graininess and slightly off dry. Some indication of a little oxidation. Mild carbonation, lightish body, pretty smooth. No alcohol noticeable. Overall, quite drinkable and an interesting interpretation.

Flavors are masterfully tame without being boring, with none of the angst and urgency present in the smell. Although a little insubstantial for the style, the texture is still pleasurably smooth.

I would classify this as an Imperial Oktoberfest or a strong plain Bock, as the toasted and sweet bready malts really dominate all facets of this beer. Definitely a nice style to enjoy this time of year and I would definitely prefer this to other, blander Oktoberfest styles but that is to be expected with the higher ABV and presumably higher/more complex malt bill.

Their was a strong taste and smell of dark fruits as the beer tasted much sweeter than a fresh bottle. It reminded me more of a barleywine than a dopplebock. The 2011 had some of these characteristics but not as much as the older bottle. I now need to 1.) Find another bottle of 2008, hopefully at Riley's Wines of the World here in Madison which is where I bought this bottle 2.) Leave a few bottles of '11 and '12 alone for a few years in hopes that it is as good as the '08 was tonight 3.)

In fact. the malt is not as assertive as I'd expected, just barely countering the grainy and hoppy bitterness up front. Fruity mid-palate, this beer finishes with a lingering bitterness and some burnt toffee. Medium in body with an exceptional, soft, creamy carbonation, this beer is quite the treat. Warming me well on this cold night, this beer really hits the spot.","DefenCorps","Feb 08, 2010"

The aroma is rather mild for a big 8% Doppelbock. Bread and toast dominate the aroma with a bit of toffee and just a slight earthy hoppiness. The flavor is pretty much an exact copy of the nose. While the bread, toffee, toast, a bit of grass all come through on the palate there is also just a slight medicinal flavor at the very back end of profile. The mouthfeel is just a bit light. I'm kind of surprised that the booze is so high but the body is so light. it definitely reminds me more of a bigger O-fest then a Doppelbock. Oktoberfest or Doppelbock its one tasty and easy drinking beer.","hwwty4","Jan 06, 2010"

A tight foamy off-white head descends to a thin layer of foam atop the doppelbock that eventually dissipates to a ring at the edge of the glass. Not much for lacing, but that doesn't bother me. Huge malt overtones fill the nose with a spicy caramel smell. Smells like an autumnal warmer perhaps. Tastes are relatively complex with a large dose of caramel and notes of sweet brown sugar leading to hints of spice, fig, and molasses perhaps. Finishes sweet with that spiciness sticking around and leaves a nice prickle on the tongue. Mouth-feel is thick and syrupy, but not overly so. Alcohol is warming, but not very noticeable on the palate. Excellent example of the style - wish I had bought more than a single bottle.","barnzy78","Sep 30, 2009"

A light brownish amber color dominates a still liquid with no bubbles. The smell is of very faint caramel with a forefront of raisins, figs and a touch of anise. The taste reflects the aroma, running forward with great raisin and fig flavors. A lot of sweetness to this beer with a wonderful malt bill. You can tell that there is a good amount of alcohol to this beer, but it is in a warming background flavor. I love the mouthfeel of this beer, it is lightly carbonated on the tongue, silky smooth and just coats your entire mouth for a nice long finish. Very drinkable for a dopplebock.

Borderline cloyingly sweet, but is kept just enough in check by the earthy hops. Chewy, thick mouthfeel, light carbonation. Light alcohol heat detected at the end.

Sweet malts round out a nice crisp hoppy bitterness that makes this one of my favorite fall brews. Some caramel malts, ripe fruitiness, sweet finish with a nice warming feeling.

The taste is also a wonderful blend of caramel, brown sugar and molasses, even for a hophead like me, this is a truly spectacular malt showcase!

The smell is the best part- rich and malty with a whiff of lager yeast, alcohol, and pear. Tastes pretty good, just not as rich as the nose suggested. Nicely balanced, though, with sweet malt and German hops. Earthy, spicy, piney, and sweet up front followed by a long bitterness and a bit more spice. Mouthfeel is relatively big, and a little prickly. Pretty drinkable as the the alcohol is somewhat hidden.","Georgiabeer","Jan 17, 2008"

Stickiness is pretty good, here and there on the side of the glass. Very mild smelling, like most doppelbocks. Delicious caramel/toffee that also has a slight yeasty white bread character but lacking a bit in aroma. Taste is much of the same as the nose. A big delicious malt explosion in the mouth. So much caramel malt flavoring, but a bit of milk chocolate seems to surface on the tounge as well. Dark fruits seem to give way as well, raisins, dates, and plum. Mouthfeel is so smooth, exactly what you would expect in a doppelbock. Full bodied with medium carbonation. I hardly detect any alcohol in this 8.5% beauty. Great representation of this style. If you enjoy bocks, definitely pick this one up.","BeerTruth","May 21, 2007"

Good notes of fif, almond to almost candied cherry, with a toastyness playing behind it. With a big inhale, there are faint notes of spice as well. Flavor is dominated with the fruity fig. The toasty melanoidans hit secondarily to break up some of the fruityness. This one is working well for me. There is a touch of deep caramelization as well that accentuates the fruity sweetness. Feel is on the thicker end of moderate with a light to moderate carbonation that doesn't break things up too much. Defnately a nice beer. Not something to drink a lot of too fast, as the flavors are very bold, but something to savor and enjoy. Definately a better beer than I gave it credit for before. I'll get this one again.","kmpitz2","Mar 20, 2006"

Mouthfeel suffers a bit from the stinging alcohol, but the beer feels pretty full and crisp in your mouth.

Very approachable at first, but developping into a surprisingly bold fruitiness and more alcohol at it reaches room temperature. Medium bodied, light-medium carbonation is appropriate.

The body is medium bordering on full, and the carbonation is fine and moderate. The mouthfeel is slightly zesty upfront before warming across the palate to become lightly creamy. The flavor is richly malty and toasty with dark crystal notes; balanced by some leafy and tea-like hop flavor that lends an almost licorice note to it. A solid bitterness lends to its dry finish although some sweetish, toasted malt does linger. Although it's not a really complex beer, it is very rich and engaging. Very unique - like a very big Vienna lager rather than a darker, more chocolatey or roasted doppelbock. Certainly worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 24, 2003"

Aroma is malty sweetness, lots of sticky caramel with some notes of thick starfuit and very dulled dark citrusy-like plums, orange, and melons. Taste is much like the bottle with a great sweetness which is smoother and thicker then the bottle with huge amounts of caramel malts, some toffee and very dulled fruits; starfruit, dull orange, and just a load of malty sweetened goodness. Chewy and sticky, smoother over all and fuller body feel on-tap with a little bit more texture and longer lingering sweetness in the finish. Holy f*ckin' yum!

Good chocolate notes combined with noteable sweetness in the mid-palate is swept away by adequate bittering on the finish. Perhaps I'm crazy, but that vanilla note comes back in the aftertaste.

In the mouth the beer sings! This is a meal and true to the style. I think the monks would like this stuff. Loads of rich malt, creamy chocolate milk like aromas. Long, full bodied, and complex in the mouth with bitter mocha, more chocolate and raisin-nuts-the alcohol is very warming,and integrated well as not to overwhelm.

The warming alcohol almost adds an odd flavor charateristic in the finish and is pretty noticable throughout as an underlying element.

It finishes with a slightly sweet tangy taste. In my opinion, it's quite an enjoyable Doppelbock. I'll have to arrange to get some again.","jcalabre","Jun 14, 2003"

4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Im not always a fan of Doppelbocks as I think they can be a little tedious sometimes with the intensity of the Munich malts. I can almost always appreciate a good example of the style, though I rarely want more than one. Capitals Autumnal Fire, while definitely a Doppelbock through and through gets higher marks for drinkability from me for the simple reason that although it meets the classical guidelines, it also manages to be interesting, without being unusual.","TXHops","Feb 24, 2003"
4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep ruby red hue w/ excellent clarity indicative of ample lagering. Vanilla white, creamy, dense and persistant one fingered head leaves isolated aggregates of foam. Sweet, sugary caramelized fruit like melanoidins and toasty Munich hits the nose at first, then are ceded by mellow, pseudo-diacetyl buttery caramel and nutty brittle. Round, lightly caramelized malt sweetness upfront in flavor yields to toasted malt and rich, toffeeish sweetness. Impressions of pralines and fruit with a side of grainy whole wheat toast. It's a continental breakfast in a glass. Perhaps slightly thin in body, yet the ample residual dextrins lend a smooth mouthfeel. Subdued hop bitterness barely offsets malt sweetness, but is sufficient enough to prevent it from becoming cloying. Trace herbal hop undertone. Finishes clean w/ lingering light bready sweetness. Mild alcohol warmth surfaces late, adding delayed additional richness. Autumnal Fire is a delicious, well crafted brew. Less complex than some imported examples of the style, but pleasantly heavy handed in caramelized malt character and tremendously smooth overall.","marc77","Jan 26, 2003"
4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Deep amber color, clear, with a tan colored head that's fairly full. Rich malt aroma with sense of caramel pushing to sweetness. Taste pushes the sweetness too, but doesn't pass to my point of displeasure. Rich malt without heavy roast or caramel. Nice lingering aftertaste without excessive dryness. Very smooth with a medium rich mouthfeel. Very good beer with nice subtleties and balance.","garymuchow","Jan 24, 2003"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Hazy redish copper color,fruity candy like aroma, taste of light maple syrup and cotten candy, sweet but balanced , thick, heavy and very tasty, another great one from this great brewery.","maxpower","Nov 20, 2002"
4.45,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is my favorite so far from Capital.  Pours a deep red-orange color with a foamy thick tan head.  The bread clean aroma is one of the most inviting of the fall seasonals.  The bold malt profile is touched with a fresh bisuit flavor.  The aggressive spice bitterness makes me picture a perfectly balanced see-saw with malt on one side and hops on the other drooping on each side from the weight of each element.  Warming, complex and flavorful.","beernut7","Oct 18, 2002"

4.8,17.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This beer is a deep beautiful scarlet color. A little head fades to nothing. Similar to some barleywines I've had. Deep, thick malt aroma. This beer is a dopplebock, but the body is in the medium to medium-full range. The taste is wonderful. Deep, smooth malt. Also get some notes of vanilla, oak, dark fruit and wood. If I were to compare this beer to another, I'd look at the JW Lees Harvest ales for similar taste profiles. This beer tastes as much like a barleywine to me as it does a dopplebock. I think the a/v for this beer is around 8.5%. I can't pick up any sign of alcohol though. Brewed to perfection by the Lager Master, Kirby Nelson. This is definitely one of the best Wisconsin brewed beers.","Bighuge","Sep 26, 2002"

4.68,15,5,4.5,5,5,4,"Thick pour, very yellow head, and an overall color of premium light maple syrup. Wonderful mouthfeel, much heavier than a Fest but not sticky. Flavor notes of light rum, some raisin, and a serious buttery toffee and floating caramel impression on the tongue. First rate cinnamon spice close. Satiny smooth, with senses of vanilla. Warming alcohol, great for cool weather. Exceptional amount of good old-fashioned great malt flavor and highly unusual in not needing a more "classical" balance. We have a first class brew here, one of the finest beers I've had.","ADR","Sep 12, 2002"
4.4,8.1,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"One of my all-time favorites...Billed as a doppelbock with an octoberfest feel...me and my brother do a lot of blind taste tests, and we were unsure what to do with this one..We placed it in our Doppelbock test in the spring and the Octoberfest in the the fall..It rated near the top in both....doesn't have the character of a Paulaner Salvator, but much easier drinking and extremly tasty....A guy could get in trouble kicking back more than a few of  these as they are very tasty and very very easy drinking...A high quality beer from the King of Bocks/Doppelbocks..","ZAP","Jan 26, 2002"
