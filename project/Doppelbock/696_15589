The taste of the beer was pretty nice, smooth semi sweet with a bitterness in the back end to sum it all up.

Getting a good amount of the chocolate, malt, and fruit in the taste, those are definitely the standouts, with spicy yeast, caramel, and baked bread notes as well.

The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, slight alcohol, caramel, cream, and chocolate upon warming. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was just plain excellent. It was very complex in both aroma and flavor while be pleasurable to both as well. Not a whole lot can be done to improve this one without moving to another style.

Hooker's doppelbock has an alcoholic burn that nearly overtakes some of the more pleasant aspects of this beer (including its very pleasant honeysuckle aroma), but as it warms up the burn fades somewhat (I expected the opposite) and that's worth a few points on my scorecard.

Soft, spongelike body. Tastes of medium-roasted malts coupled with more candied malt notes. Mineral notes and vague plum acidity combine for a leathery effect at the back of the throat while smokiness persists. Mild mineral, roasted barley twang, spicy anise, and woodsy notes diffuse the sweetness at the finish while the understatedly juicy hops remain in the background. Delectable flavors, overall.

Damn, this thing smells kinda like a quad, only ... browner. The taste is a bit lighter than the smell, with more fruity notes and a heavier dose of baked oatmeal cookies.

Rich dark malts fill my palette with tastes of caramel, fig, date, and hints of alcohol and a slightly earthy hop bite that keeps everything in check.

4.55,8.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a glass mug. The beer is an opaque dark brown with a very big off white head. It is made up of large bubbles, but has a cap of foam on top. There was some clinging carbonation on the sides of the glass, but they have disappeared. It is a very pretty beer. This beer has a very pleasant aroma. It is full of roasted malts, almost coffee like in their scent, but not quite. There is also some dark chocolate and caramel sweetness as well as a touch of bitter hops. It all works very well together. The beer starts out with a nice malt flavors. I can make out creamy toffee and banana. As I swallow, the bitterness comes to the forefront. It is a bit coffee-like and tastes like it is coming from the malts and not from hops. Also present in the finish is a bit of alcohol. It isn't burning, but simply warming, similar to a quality aged whiskey. The beer has a medium body, but feels lighter than it actually is. It has a hint of creaminess to its consistency. There is a good amount of carbonation; it gets to be a bit too much is a swish the beer around in my mouth, but since I don't normally do that, I can't detract any points for that aspect. It leaves a good coat, but it isn't sticky at all, which I find most impressive. The coat feels slick without being oily. The beer is incredibly drinkable. Even though it is a strong lager, I can still see myself drinking a lot of these. Next time, I'm going to have to purchase more than one bottle. This is a beer definitely worth seeking out.","ToasterChef","Jul 29, 2010"

The aroma is boozey, and sweet with dark fruit. The flavor follows the nose, dark sweet plums and dates with rum rounding out the flavor. A candy like sweetness lingers for an eternity with each sip.

4.15,-1.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown with a nice big head - would've never guessed it was around 4 years old. Doesn't leave much lacing, but still, nice looking. The smell is interesting, maybe not as complex as a fresher version, but I get a strong whiff of C02 upfront which burns the nostrils (not exactly a 'smell' to C02, but I know the feeling), followed by raisins, powdery milled grains, cola and a kind of grapey yeast smell. Nice smells, but a little subdued. The taste was very nice. You start out with a slight roastiness, backed up with grapes or plums, juicy and a little sweet. And there's a bit of dried fruit in the yeast character as well - rasins and dates. It is actually a little more dry than I was expecting, but definitely sweet enough to be great. As it warms a bit, there are notes of straw and dry chocolate - it starts to get quite grainy too, still the grape juice flavor is noticable as well. But really, the overriding flavor that I start to notice is just pure caramel, burnt sugar, but kind of dry (less sweet) than the real thing. Very nice background for all of the flavor (and sometimes it leaps to the foreground - keeping the whole thing quite complex). A very nice flavor profile. The body is nice, kind of medium, but thinned a little by drynes at times, quite lively carbonation. This is a very nice beer aged, and I have a 2009 that I plan on drinking soon. The complexities abound, and I was really glad to get to try this - would definitely go for it again.","taylorhamrick","May 21, 2010"

Wow, weird but strangely alluring for the male beer animal. The flavor is similarly intense with peat and swamp malt. Skunk cabbage overwhelms this oddity that tends more toward repugnence than desirability but it's a full bodied quality brew just the same. I get touches of bayberry and seaweed hops, sweet red wine with nutty highlights. Very tiny carbonation in this full bodied brew. Close to being a syrupy brew, not drinkable beyond a slow drinker with cheese. It's sort of nasty but flavorful if you can handle the intensity.

Pours very dark, barely see-through when held up to the light with ruby and burnt orange highlights. Has a nice pillowy beige head that shrinks down, eventually becoming a bubbly ring. Leaves very little lacing. Smell has a nice chocolate element to it, a bit of bread/molasses and dark fruit as well. Taste is quite complex. Getting alot of toffee, burnt chocolate, buttery biscuits. A bit of an alcohol bite. A hint of vanilla sweetness somewhere in there too. I may be digging a bit deep now but somewhat of a plum/red grape taste too? Complex, tasty stuff. Not quite the malty feast that the Celebrator is. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, it is a bit too carbonated and boozy at first but that seems to go away quickly. A sweet dark rum-like finish. Drinkability is good, the price for the new 4-pack is a much better deal than the 500ml. Considering this was a doppelbock I drank it quite fast. Very good.","Chico1985","Apr 12, 2010"

Explosive tangy malty nose, tobacco, leather, slightly metallic, dark bread crust, burnt caramel. The flavor takes a second for my palate to calibrate to, but once it does, wow. Clearly unlike any other doppelbock. Ashy and very smokey, with charred breads and sugars. There's also somehow a solid fruitiness midpalate that I can't put my finger on. Maybe stone fruit.

I've had most of the highest rated Doppels, and I would rate the Hooker over any except Celebrator. It has more hop bite than any of the German examples of the style, but still retains the chocolate notes and body. A wonderfully balanced beer, truly world class. The porter has made it to Ft. Myers, but I've only found the Doppel in the Tampa area. Only criticisms are the price and the lack of a seal on the flip top.

One finger of off-white, spotty lacing; no visible carbonation. The aroma was an impressive mix of chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, and caramel. The taste however seemed to reveal a little too much roasted malt dominance, almost like a burned piece of toast. While it was refreshing to experience a dopplebock that didn't bleed sugary annoyance, the burnt toast flavor was a little too much for me. The alcohol was well-hidden, I must say, but I am unfortunately at odds with some of the other reviews when I say that the feel was a little on the heavy side relative to other dopples that I've tried.

The flavor follows suit with malts being the main flavor with raisins, brown sugar and other dark fruits. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy leaving a good, malty flavor on the palate.

As I take first sip I am taken by the uniqueness of this flavor profile. You get an initial burnt malt sweetness and toffee richness. This is followed by a candied apple feel with hints of carmel and sour fruit. The spice line on this beer is complex and well balanced with a just right mixture of sweet, rich, sour, and bitter.

There is a slightly bubbly, slightly creamy brownish head to this beer if you want to force it out of the bottle. Poured carefully, the beer doesn't have all that much of a head. There is lacing on the side of the glass. There isn't much carbonation to this very full bodied beer and the smell is all about the sweet malts. I'm picking up some chalkiness in the aroma along with caramel, nut flavors, butterscotch/toffee, and maybe the barest hint of heavy fruit. The taste is quite creamy, dense, wonderfully malty caramel, some burnt brown sugars, some roasted grains, some huskiness as well. There is a slight bite on the back of the tongue with this beer, and I knocked the drinkability down a point as a result. Overall, this beer evinces lots of creaminess in the mouth. The 8% ABV is pretty well hidden in the overall character of the beer. The aftertaste doesn't have a throaty alcohol presence, but there still is that partly sourish, partly biting characteristic on the back end that diminishes things ever so slightly.

There's a touch of cardboard from oxidation and sour tang from bacteria, but that's expected and doesn't really detract from the flavor.

There is also a fair touch of fruit in the nose raisins and plums come to mind. The taste is also very nice dominated by the malts nice full maltiness without it being heavy, a little sweet up front but finishes roasty and burnt with a lingering burnt grain bitterness a lot of chocolate in there throughout. Hidden fruitiness in the back adds a pleasant balance but remains light enough to let the grain do all the talking. Hops are minimal providing just a touch of bitterness that is almost indiscernible from the bitter grain and it is really only in there to balance the malt, which it does nicely.

Rich aroma with lots of toasted malt, hints of chocolate, plum and raisin. Also a bit of subtle smoke character as it warms.

4.55,8.1,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark, russet tinged brown with minimal head. Not a very volatile nose. There are some rich smells in there, mostly in the molasses/sweet malts vein, but they're very subdued aromas. What aromas are there carry over into the palate, though, which is rich in sugary, dark fruits like raisins and figs. Full and found mouthfeel, with fine carbonation and a noticeable hop bite of bitterness. Fabulous tastes in here, well varied, complex, and each sensation of high quality. This is an excellent doppelbock; I'll have to try some of the 2007 version as soon as it comes out.","geexploitation","Oct 01, 2006"

Opens with an audible pop, and pours a deep dark brow, almost black, with a thick tan head with good retention and a lot of lacing. Aroma is some sour fruit, with a hint of alcohol and just a whole lot of maltiness. Taste is almost a cross between a stout and a dopplebock, with roasted coffee flavors up front and a deep dark maltiness in the finish, with a nice warming sensation on the way down. I'm noticing a bit more hops in the finish as it warms up. Mouthfeel is thick and slick with fine carbonation. Very drinkable; I'll have no problem putting down a liter of this.

I liked it enough the first time around to get it again, but I think I like it even more this time around - I did notice that this keg had a date on it that suggested that it was less than three weeks old - given that this keg is so young, I thought perhaps that the first one was older and that this beer is better younger - but I don't really know how old the first keg was, so this is just conjecture... Either way, this is really a good beer. The mouthfeel isn't great - in the mouth it sort of feels a bit light or carbonated (even though it doesn't look that way) - perhaps this is just a function of the high alcohol - but I love the taste. Speaking of alcohol, its high - that seems to take away from drinkability and I can smell it a bit on the nose... But overall, I recommend it.","jswigart","Sep 26, 2006"

Aroma is of dark burnt malt, with german hop aromas, intense but not overwhelming--inviting you to taste. The flavor is rather clean actually, roasty, multilayered in malts, focused, and delicious all around. The hops are a distinctive part of whats going on here and no afterthought--slightly citric and floral even....Mellow in their intensity, but lplenty of them. The finish is clean but notably hop laden for such a dark beer. To me, drinking this is better than most porters actually, due to it's focused intensity--sort of dark and stout like, but not quite a stout. There is something about a good complex lager and this is a fine representation of that. Mouthfeel is thick, nearly syrupy, with a healthy amount of carbonation. This is just far too drinkable for 8%...liquid bread! Alas, if only it came bottled in pints!","Liquids","Jun 06, 2006"

Malty, hoppy, and minerally. Chocolate-covered salted nuts with an earthy, leafy side. Oh-so balanced with its alcohol, dessert-like malt, and smooth velvety bitterness. A bit thinner than I expected, but still full and rich. A little candyish, but just enough so as to be dessert-like but not so much as to be cloying or to lose drinkability. This makes me think of an imperial brown ale (go to hell, you style nazis). Let me say that the liter can realistically be thoroughly enjoyed by one person. If I had to pick one doppelbock, it would still be the Celebrator, but this one has an awesomeness of its own, and it is made just a couple hours away from my hometown. Cheers to all at Hooker!

4.11,-2.4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Ok, I'm revisiting this beer. I had it on tap before, and I think I like the bottled version better. Or, maybe it's just that I have more of an opportunity to relax and drink this huge bottle than to judge it from a really cold pint with dinner one night. Either way, it seems like there's a lot more complexity to this brew than I originally thought. I definitely recommend getting the big bottle of this (reasonably priced at nine bucks for a huge thing) and taking it all in over a slow evening. Excellent head retention here, on top of a nice dark brown color, nearly opaque. Smell is a bit tough to pick out actually, which is surprising, since this brew is so full of flavor. But what I do pick out is actually a seemingly hoppy scent, which also strikes me as a bit odd, knowing that this beer is primarily a malty extravaganza. Definitely a roastiness as well though, with a pungent bitterness. Taste is all over the board. That milky flavor that I find to be ever present in dopplebocks is there, but first comes an array of dark, fruity, roasted malts and a burnt bitterness that balances it all out. The hopping of this beer, subtle as it is, is pretty perfect in my book - reminiscent of a Belgian pale ale, nice and spicy, and dusty. This definitely plays a big part in balancing the beer in my opinion, though one might overlook it at first. With out that nice subtle hop character, this beer would be just like your typical American over-done beer. But it's better than that. Much better. Excellent balance, to reiterate, yet still aggressive and unique. Surprisingly bouncy mouthfeel for this one also really separates it from other beers that just try to bombard you with darkness. A super thick mouthfeel, as much as we sometimes love them, would not work with this beer. Definitely a great American beer. Gotta get some more sometime, because it seems to get better the more I drink it. Evolve...","twelvsies","Sep 29, 2005"

Taste is excellent; flavors of smooth dark chocolate, roasted nuts, and some dark fruity flavors toward the finish, all the while remaining very, very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and rich, with the carbonation bringing the tastebuds to attention and giving them something to notice. High drinkability, even with the 8% ABV, I'm not gonna have any trouble taking care of this one litre bottle on my own!

The retention is good, and it holds fairly well considering its strength, but eventually drops to a thin collar. The lacing is somewhat limited, but that's common for the style. The nose offers a combination of fruit; caramelish and delicately nutty malts; and a hint of alcohol. In the mouth it's crisp, medium-bodied, and fine-bubbled. The flavor is very much as the aroma suggests, with caramelish malt that suggests some chocolate and a hint of roastiness along with a mild fruitiness (that combines dark and very red fruits) and a judicious amount of alcohol. The bitterness is balancing, and and it finishes dry with a light wash of drying alcohol and some lingering toasty and very subtly smoky/roasty malt.","NeroFiddled","Sep 06, 2005"

There was sweet chocolate and caramel, toasted malts, some nuttiness, butter and toffee. Lots of toffee in the finish, along with a huge helping of bitterness. The more I drank, the more it tasted like chocolate. Overall, I would say that Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock is an excellent liquid version of a Snickers bar. Nice, thick mouthfeel too.

I liked the 2005 better, and its qualities may be entirely attruibuted to freshness, bolder flavour,bitterness, tabacco, cocoa creaminess, bigger head. A joy. The 2004 was more of a malt experience, with generous chocolate malts and a barleywine taste, little hops, slightly oxidized which others may enjoy. My rating is based on the higher 2005.","Sammy","Jul 04, 2005"
4.53,7.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark red. It has a very thick fluffy light brown, tan head. It fades very slowly leaving a very good amount of laces. It smells spicy, and malty. It also has a very strong hop aroma. It also smells of chocolate, and slightly of caramel. It aroma of alcohol is very faintly present. It tastes quite spicy. It sweet malts. It is very sweet. The roasted malts give it a very appealing flavor. It has a slight hop flavor, but nothing to strong. It leaves a caramel sweet flavor on the palate. It goes down quite smoothly. I think that this beer might be a little overcarbonated. Not so much that it detracts from the flavor though. I think this beer would make a pretty good session beer. It is not too high in alcohol, so that wouldnt be a problem. The flavor, though slightly aggressive, is mild enough as to not become overbearing. I would recomend this one to anyone that likes Doppelbock's. If I had access to this beer, I would definately drink it again. Thanks to goodbyeohio for hooking me up with this great beer.","OStrungT","Jun 27, 2005"

I took this to poker night on Friday and with the women there it turned it to a game of trival pursuit. This beer was a pleasent distraction if for the few sips I lost to the curious. It smelled of fresh pulled wort that was already infused with noble hops. It was a real palate buster, of sweet carmalized wort but a silkyness that is close to heaven. There is a little alcohol in the finish and it coats your mouth with an aftertaste that invites you back. I had no problem finishing the whole 1L, a very nice beer.","Higravity","Jun 12, 2005"

First, its definitely of the first rank, although not necessarily head and shoulders above some other peers like Celebrator and Salvator. Although Im not likely to have the opportunity to drink this regularly, I will endeavor to have this again on occasion. Im of two minds about the bottle. It definitely makes a statement, and it is a good value (~$8 or so Ive been told, especially compared to the ridiculous Rogue swing-tops) considering you get a great re-usable growler; but by the same token, the package definitely discourages grabbing one from the fridge when you might only want one.

This is huge with malt, roasted malt and caramel aromas round this out. While being super malty it manages to stay balanced and very appetizing. Bitter sweet dark chocolate and roasted malt are the big flavors. Notes of dark berries added a nice twist to it as did the caramel. Other dark fruits a present in small underlying notes. Finishes up with a long lingering roasted malt. Mouthfeel is almost full and as creamy smooth as you could ask for. Simply a treat to drink. Drinkability is up there as well.

Similarly, the mouthfeel was nicely dry and with a very satisfying alcohol burn. It was a very smooth and easily drinkable beer.

Taste is rich, mainly malt and molasses...a hint of fruit...a hint of hops on the finish. This reminds me somewhat of a great Imnperial Stout (which is one of my favorite types). Mouthfeel is substantial, chewy, smooth...reminds me of the richness you get in a high fat, premium ice cream (can they freeze this stuff?). This is 8.0 abv?

Full-bodied, meaty, mouth filling bliss. Chewable malty blend of toast & roast meet expected noble hops in an explosion of rich flavors. Dark bready fruit cake topped with licorice syrup and mild roasted vanilla. Hints of chocolate, brandy, and toasted almonds. Masterfully complex and downright delicious.

Its highly malty, almost caramelic with a shadow roastiness, chocolate hints and a luscious earthy profile. Palate is also deeply earthy, like ceoncentrated malt, but still very soft and smooth. Welcomed green hops joins in the finish, rather grassy. It finishes on mild chracoal and potent tobacco notes all around an oily presence, making me think of roasty mazola. Like the other troutbrooks Ive had, this has this honest medium body which seems a bit dead, mostly from low carbonation and seems to take off from the flavor development and this is really too bad.

A swirl of the goblet releases a pleasant Noblesque hop aroma. HOLY SHIT!!! Every aroma carries through into the initial sip and then some! This is simply awesome, I must have more. A complex array of roasted and caramelized malt flavors leads the way while floral and herbal hops provide the perfect balancing act. Dark pit fruit, toffe, creamy malted milk, Ovalteen. This is the creamiest beer I've ever had. Oh why did I wait so long to buy one of these, now they're gone. I savor every drop of this near-black liquid.

The aroma was sweet and roasty malt that gave off delicate fig, and chocolate notes. The hops had that distinctly Germanic grassy tone to them. The taste was sweet and malty, like a dopplebock should be. There were raisin, fig, apple, and toffee flavors to be enjoyed here. There was also an earthy herbal spiciness to the hops.

Fruity nose did not live up to its billing in the flavor department, but I picked up some chocolate flavors along with raisin notes. Only slight hop aromas, but the hops were plentiful and drying on the tounge. Mouthfeel was moderate and dissapointing for a dopplebock. Picked up some vinagery aromas towards the end of the liter. I did put down a liter in one sitting, but it did not leave me wanting another.

Slight booze is also evident in the aroma of this brew. The taste of this brew is really quite exceptional. I taste some nice sweet malts and roasted malts up front with some wonderful clove-like spices in the middle and a sweet-yet-almost-dry milk chocolate taste in the finish.

Smells ok, not the best actually, but caramely, malty, little bit of chocolate and coffee, and kind of like a soft pretzel actually. It tastes much better than it smells, I think. Like carmel and coffee and a bit of spice, kind of toasted, very malty though, with a touch of hops in the finish, and an alcoholic aftertaste, but not too much. Maybe like a burnt soft pretzel?

4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Much thanks goes out to beergeek279 and cupbeerman for letting me join in on the sampling of this highly rated d-bock. We enjoyed it at one of the newest beer hotspots in the Burgh, the Pittsburgh Bottleshop Cafe where we sampled this brew in official Celebrator glasses, man are those things cool. Anyway on to this beer. Appearance: Deep dark ruby chocolate hue tan head forms nice and thick leaves some scattered lacing throughout the tasting session. Aroma: I was hit with some underlying vinous wine like character along with robust healthy dosages of chocolate roastiness, and a touch of underlying over ripened fruit notes. Seems bigger than the average doppelbock much more complex the hops send herbal tones across my nasal passage, not bad. Taste: Alot more chocolate flavor than your typical doppelbock seems porterish in many ways, but regardless tasty and so damn drinkable. A touch of raisin and alcohol sear the palate with mild overly ripened plums complex and good, but seems this one caught alot of hype. Don't get me wrong I love it but what sets this one so far apart from St Victorious or Korbinian, in my opinion not much. Mouthfeel: Medium body big lager here very delicate carbonation makes going down that much smoother. Drinkability: All in all a damn fine d-bock that I enjoyed, but I think I let my expectations ruin the experience for me just a bit. Incredibly smooth and flavorful robust version of the style very good I must seek out more brews from Troutbrook Brewing, well done.","WVbeergeek","Jul 16, 2004"
4.58,8.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"i'm pretty impressed. this isn't just good, it achieves things i haven't experienced in a beer before, the creamy dryness, with the mellow somewhat understated but complex taste, really unique and really good.","kmo1030","Jul 06, 2004"
4.73,12.4,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Delicious. If you didn't hear me, delicious. What more can I say. Dark brown almost opaque with a very nice creamy head. Aroma - malty and roasty. Sweet malty taste, munich malt comes through, very creamy mouthfeel, 8% alcohol, I dont see it or taste it. This is a very dangerous beer. it goes down so nice that if you drink it too much of it, you will feel it. I don't know if there is a perfect 5 beer but this one is close.","kennyo","Jul 05, 2004"
4.83,14.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Wow, I finally got my hands on the beer with the latest buzz. First the appearance.. well, holy cow that is a impressive looking bottle. 1 full liter. Dang... nice flip cap on top, with the lil bit of tape noting bottling year. Nice touch. Poured into a glass (with a bit of glugging due to bottle design).. Pours nice and dark black, almost imperial stout dark. A head that starts nice and thick and then leaves itself stuck on the sides of the glass. Smells of Roasted malts, perhaps a bit too much of roasted malts as it is hard to pick up any sweetness in the aroma. Tastes of roasted malt, and some hit of alcohol in there. It's there, but it's not overpowering. Very very smooth for a beer of this magnitude... Nice rich and creamy mouthfeel.... all around, a great brew!","deejaydan","Jul 04, 2004"
4.8,14,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"It is a opaque, deep brown color with a billowy tan head. Sweet malty aromas pour out of the glass with some noble hop floral and spicy notes. As with decoction mashing, the malt flavors are clean and malted-milk like. Grainy, woody, and very slightly smokey in a finish which is nice and long. The full, chewy body is balanced nicely with spicy and mellow hop flavors and bitterness.It has a nice rustic Black Forrest quality to it, highly recomended.","jeffboo","Jun 24, 2004"
4.43,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"An American doppelbock that eschews the toffee-ish restraint of its German progenitors, in favor of a much more robust, roastier, state of complexity. At certain points, this took on properties of a porter; other times it alternated between fruity and chocolatey; and still other times it was an unmistakable, caramelish doppel. Complex to say the least! It poured dark impenetrable brown with a pretty small head that lingered until the very end. The aroma was surprisingly mild, with faint twinges of nuts, caramel, and a slight hint of coffee. The flavor strongly carried over the nutty flavors, balanced with a noticeable herbal hop spiciness. Coffee bitterness became noticeable, balanced by some chocolate, with a heaping dollop of brown sugar and maple syrup. Eventually the fruity flavors revealed themselves as well: dried apricot, peach, sour apple, maybe some cherry. The aftertaste was enormous, and where the beer did most of its flourishing; many of the mentioned complexities were revealed only after the swallow. The rich hop spiciness tempered and balanced the beer, and kept any fruity or caramel sweetnesses firmly in their place. The mouthfeel was full and supple, and deliciously creamy, and for a beer of its darkness and fullness, it drank remarkably easily. I did find, however, that by the end of a pint, I was ready to either stop, or try a different beer. The 1 liter bottle is perfect for splitting, or the swingtop could be re-closed and saved for tomorrow.","Thrasher","Jun 13, 2004"
4.55,8.1,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Thomas Hooker Liberator Dopplebock was served from a one liter flip-top bottle with a "bottled in 2004" lid seal. In a pint glass, the beer was dark dark brown color and was topped by a thin and fine tan head. The nose was quite subtle, but yielded some very nice aromas...chewy creamy coffee malts, countering figgy sharpness, and dark fruit esters. The taste was anything but subtle. A big creamy coffee-raisen malt profile hit, then quickly opened up with tingling dark figgy-choco-sharp bitterness...laced with dried fruits such as apricot, cherry, and peaches. Nutty flavors then appeared in the transition to a drier cocoa-bitter nutty dark fruity finish. The distinct stages of flavors and sensations captivated me. This beer had just the right mix of malts, fruits, and bitterness. The body was well-composed for the flavors and character of the beer, as was the high-powered carbonation. The balance and excellent flavor of this dopplebock made for easy drinking. Liberator Dopplebock is not to be missed. Big thanks to Thrasher for sharing this treat.","HiroProtagonist","Jun 09, 2004"
4.43,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Bottled 2004. Pellucid deep garnet hue. Lofty, dense, pitted, dogged beige head. Steadfast lace remains. Waft of underripe plum combined with dulcet, rounded dark toffee initially in aroma. Bittersweet cocoa and herbal hops hints follow. Hints of bubblegum and minty ethanol with a deep inhale. In flavor, incipient is a fleeting impression melanoidin derived caramel glazed almond. Nutty sweetness diminishes readily, and is ensued by notes of singed, chocolate dusted sugar cookie. Mid palate, dark fruit character surfaces in a sherry macerated ripe plum suggestion. Spicy, stately, leafy noble hop flavor augments as the beer warms, lending herbal and slightly grassy contrasts. Hop bitterness is agreeably understated and serves only to partially offset the ample, but well conducted residual unfermentables. Similar as in the aroma, a subdued ethanol presence is mint like and couples well with the subtle Hallertauer hop flavor. Moderately dextrinous in mouthfeel, with an airy softness conducive to effortless sipping. Finishes sweet yet brisk, with polished toasty Munich malt and turbinado hints carried by an intangible lager derived pastel. A delectable doppelbock with multifacted sweetness without any cloying qualities. Immaculately crafted. Sincere thanks to Mikeys01 for the delivery.","marc77","May 29, 2004"

5,18.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Oh yeah, it was time to open up the Liberator today. Big 1 liter bottle of goodness. Love the bottle and the label design they put on this bottle. That little yellow tape you see on the top mentions what year the beer was brewed in. Poured out black, but there was some dark to medium brown in there. Looked like dark milk chocolate. There was a thin layer of head on there, I thought it was going to go away but stayed all the way through. Smell was quite malty. Some cocoa in there, perhaps a touch of nuts and dark fruit (plums mostly). Caramel and chocolate also hit the nose. Quite complex. Taste was just as complex as the smell was. Big chewy malty base sets the foundation of this brew. Some plums and caramel hit the palate gently, with some chocolate and hop undertones. Finishes dry which makes you want to sip a little more everytime. This beer will wow you for sure. My only complaint is that I shared this with people, but that's ok. I'm just spreading the love around me. What a stunning beer.","necoadam","May 01, 2004"

4.47,6.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"sweet 1 liter swing top bottle - pours a rich dark chocolate brown with ruby undertones. tan head dissipated quickly - I drank this warm and the aromas were spicey, chocolate, sweet - like a dark baking chocolate bar. The flavors were sweet complex malts, moving from sweet chocolate to spicey nutmeg to toffee/cofffee, all wrapped up with a nice hop finish, dryer than one sees in the other "...ators" from germany. While not as thick and cloying as the typical doppelbocks, it was great and the abv was well disguised, but ever present in thr background something I would not have expected from a thinner doppel. enjoy!","counselor","Apr 19, 2004"
4.89,16.2,4,5,5,4.5,5,"The exquisite taste and nose, the silky feel and somewhat foreboding appearance made Liberator amazingly drinkable. Add that the 8% alcohol content is very well masked and it gets downright dangerous. All in all, Liberator struck me not so much as being a doppelbock as being a doppelbock borne of a barleywine, such was its complexity and breadth of hops character. Easily the finest doppelbock I've had and worth picking up on sight or working out a trade for.","Boilermaker88","Apr 14, 2004"
4.83,14.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Huge malts make up the flavor profile on this one. Bittersweet and complex, but oh so drinkable. There is just the right amount of a hoppy bite to this beer and the slightest hint of the alcohol lurking there. Smooth and creamy with prickly carbonation. The biggest fault to this beer is that the liter sized bottle just isn't enough! How about a 2 liter next time?","cretemixer","Apr 10, 2004"
4.97,18.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Notes: Absolutely outstanding in every respect, and a credit to the style.

4.8,14,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I have been Liberated!...and hope to be many more times in the furture, Paul Davis has done another great one. Served from an amply sized 1L brown bottle, beautiful glossy label graphics. Pours from the bottle a very chocolatey opaque brown, capped with just enough tan head to appreciate before it sinks into the murky depths. Aroma is full of toasty and roasty malt, caramel sweetness, and perfect spicy hop notes as an accent. Taste is wonderfully full of complexity, leaving you at first wading through the roasty malt flavors, then basking in a myriad mix of fermenting fruit, crisp and spicy hops, and fresh roasted hazelnuts, among others. Full bodied but exceptionally smooth, alcohol is very well concealed and only became apparent to me in the finish once I was halfway through the glass. Excellent local offering, those who can't get it should be jealous!","mikeys01","Apr 04, 2004"
4.68,11.2,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"1 Liter Swing-top Bomber: First off, the bottle is superb. When you pour this one it is an opaque brown color. There is a bit of a tan head. Decent lacing. The first thing that hits the nose is some roastiness: I didn't expect this much in a doppelbock. There is sweetness in the nose also. Caramel, fruits, and maybe a hint of smokiness? The flavor is rich and full. The roastiness is there, but there is a ton of other flavors in here. Complex and extremely tasty. Their beers just keep on getting better with each release.","Boto","Mar 20, 2004"
