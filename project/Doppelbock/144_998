The 16 oz. bottle poured well into the pint glass, a nearly black hue leaving little froth, but giving lots for the nose to contemplate--plenty of chocolate, caramel, and yeasty good tidings. The taste is rich and smooth, smoother than many dopples, in fact, and somewhat (though a little less) comparable to Sam Adams' first-rate Double Bock. I also get a nice hint of berry. Decent carbonation deprives this of what would be a better mouthfeel, but this is a terrific beer, a great dopplebock with sweets on a very cold Midwestern day. Cheers!","Gehrig","Oct 22, 2007"

Creamy chocolate taste and extremely smooth, the kind of smooth that I imagine got people to switch to lagers from ale once upon a time.

The initial roastiness subsides to a creamy feel at the top. The finish comes back with some roasty and spicy notes but the maltiness is always there. Intriguing, tasty, quite good.

Like the aroma, the flavor has a sourness lurking in the background. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. No sign of the nearly 8% abv. Pretty good drinkability.

3.93,2.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Deep chestnut with a thin but full tan crown. Very Belgiany. Lively flavorful yeast. Vinous in the extreme for a bock. Dark fruit front, toffee middle, and spicy/citric hop finish that improves as the beer warms. Very drinkable for a bock as well. A tad thin but still creamy enough to be enjoyable.","DaPeculierDane","Aug 30, 2005"

However there is a lot of room for improvement, the appearance and mouthfeel could use some work as well as some added complexity and power in the aroma and taste. Still one of the better American Doppelbocks I have had, and a pretty good deal for the price. This was particularly disappointing after being really impressed by Sprecher's Black Bavarian.","OldSock","Apr 30, 2005"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy bright dark amber-brown with a decent foamy lasting off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Has a sweet fruity and bready aroma. Sweet and malty fruity and caramel flavors, medium body with a slick and smooth mouthfeel, finishes sweet, alcohol well hidden, very nice.","maxpower","Mar 05, 2005"
4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I continue to be surprised by this brewery, maybe because I bought a mixed four-pack for $2.95, but this stuff is great! Surprisingly authentic tasting. Pours a deep dark brown with some crimson shining through, and a white creamy head. I love the milky creamy tastes and smells coming from this beer. There's also a decent amount of complexity in the taste. First of all, it's a malt explosion. Soft and sweet for the most part, but a bit of bitter coffee been rounding out the finish. There's a nice almost merlot character to this beer which I'm finding quite nice. A great dopplebock from a great brewery.","twelvsies","Jan 22, 2005"
4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark crimson ruby color, with large tan head. The carbonation slowly fades away. Smells of caramel and roasty, definitely sweet and fruity. Taste is sweet and resinous, but not thick. Dark fruits and caramel dominate the taste with some residual bitterness at the end, but not much. A little bit of the yeast profile shows towards the end. mouthfeel is not thick, but not too thin, on target for the style. Very drinkable, one of sprechers better brews and a top notch Dbock","bnuttz","Jan 09, 2005"
3.9,1.6,4,4,4,3,4,"Cloudy medium brown boasts a lasting off-white head. Excitingly vinous aroma full on the currants and blackberries jam flavors. Sweet Iced tea like caramelic malt comprises a generous roasted raisin bread overtone. Nutty with more roasted candies and pumpernickel complexities all while deploying a savant fruit knowledge. Fitting lagerish body with moderate carbonation may not carry it to excellence, but doesnt affect negatively either. Remarkable take on the style mostly due to its unique deep roastiness.","Rastacouere","Dec 20, 2004"
4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A surprise of a dopple for sure, this beer poured out very dark with a small amount of head. I couldn't decipher the bottled on dates of these bottles, but I will guess they are over a year+ old, but i didn't notice any ill affects because of that fact. The taste was very malty, but not with the syrupy brown sugar flavors that many young dopples have. A dryer, more porter -like flavor with increased acidity and coffee flavors. Alcohol is very present. Mouthfeel is right on, and I proved to myself that the drinkability is very high.","TastyTaste","Nov 16, 2004"

3.27,-14.8,3.5,4,3,3,3,"As I have said before, Sprecher doesn't have the ability to knock your socks off, but they are truly one of the greatest, low-priced, breweries in the country. This seasonal dopplebock was decent overall, but didn't have the normalities that I look for in a dopple bock. It seemed a little too dark for this style. It was remnant of a porter in both appearance and taste. The was a nutty, roasted presence that seemed a little off-balance, but the finish was very nice and malty. A great seasonal that is definately worth a try!","ALESwhatCURESya","Oct 31, 2004"
3.94,2.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a chestnut hue with garnet tints and develops a light beige head that fades quickly to an edge layer. Mild toffee aroma and some general fruitiness mixed in berries and pears I think. First sip reveals a small yet prickly carbonation and average body. The flavor is sweet and sugary up front with toffee and brown sugar dominant, some ripe fruit as well. The finish is rather dry and allows some hints of vanilla. There is a bit of a sweet coating on my tongue after the swallow almost a syrupy feel to it. Overall a very nice brew and easy to drink. Wish I had bought more than one bottle!","sulldaddy","Oct 31, 2004"
3.57,-7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The carbonation was quite bitey up front, medium-bodied throughout w/ a nice sweet alcohol burn at the end. Drinkability was pretty decent...not my favorite dopplebock by any means, but a nice find as well.","Fish113d","Aug 07, 2004"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Sprecher beer has always been available at the airport in Milwaukee, and has been there to keep me company in flight delays. I was very happy when this beer became available here in MA. This dopplebock has a deep brown color with a medium tan head , not too much lace. A candy, malty aroma from the roasted malt dominates the nose. A thick, rich malty taste with a light alcohol back. No hops to be found in the flavor. Heavy mouth feel with a great drinkability. Many dopples are dominated by alcohol, this one really puts the malt forward. Nice beer.","carln26","Jul 15, 2004"
3.92,2.1,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Drinkability: a little light for my liking giving this beer questionable drinkability considering the style. a good beer but not a Paulaner Salvator either. overall, nice complexity and balance.","Popsinc","Jun 15, 2004"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Brown-burgandy, fairly clear. Not much in the way of head; what's there certainly fades quickly. Caramel and sweet, wet malts. Deep down there's an almost fruity sensation that reminds me of a squished fig newton. Smacks of roasted bitterness in the middle through the end. Somehow remains "light" and drinkable. Stays very smooth even through the hop bitterness; never gets astringent, something I've found common in some bock and dopplebock beers that are trying too hard for balance. Just a trickling of prune juice across the tongue washed away by more dominant "pure" malt flavors. Quite a nice doppelbock.","marburg","May 08, 2004"
4.63,20.6,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2 inch tall beige head. Would like a bit longer head retention time, but for a dopplebock, we'll forgive and move on. Amazingly deeply reddish brown in shade, a thing of beauty in front of the light. Heavy malt nose, with alcohol apparent. Sweet malty flavor, with undercurrent of berries or cherries, and that alcohol that was present in the nose is only found here in the warming feelings of the mouth and tummy. Exactly what I'm looking for in a dopplebock. Mouthfeel is excellent as well, and the drinkability drops down just a tad, because although I want more and more, I know it'll kick my ass later... So glad Sprecher is now getting distributed in MA!","ppoitras","May 07, 2004"

3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Had this on tap at BW3's in Indy. Poured a deep brown with ruby red hues. Not much head but plenty of lacing on the glass. Aroma was malty sweet with a hint of fruit thrown in. Add to that a touch of the hops. Taste is oh so good. Malty sweet, but not overly so, with a little tanginess that really balances it out. However the mild carbonation and thin watery mouthfeel detracted from it slighly. All in all a very good doppel bock in my humble opinion. I can't wait to have this on tap again!","Indybeer","Jan 17, 2004"
3.85,0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Deep reddish sienna color with a creamy 1/4 inch head on a hard pour. Coats the glass lightly, little lace. Malty aromas, some sense of fig and raisin. Decent mouthfeel, consistent but somewhat lighter than stickier Doppels. Very pleasant taste, slighlty buttery caramel with even some chocolate notes. Well-balamced, hops are background players but are noticeable in the light raisin tones. Overall, this strikes me as meeting style, but middle-of-the-road -- in the Salvator category with slightly more limited body. A drinkable beer for sure, though.","ADR","Dec 26, 2003"

Aroma is a bit like purple grape juice with a tangy sweetning sense, with touches of caramel, raisin, and alcohol with some roasty tones to it, but overall a bit to light and subdued. Taste is mildly malty with a dull sweetness of fruityness upfront that flows right into a nice roasty end that has some cocoa and burntish notes. Moderately rich and creamy feel with a solid medium body and a touch of chalkyness and restrained sweetness intermingling with roastyness in the finish. A very drinkable brew with a clean, soft smoothness and quiet roasted character.","tavernjef","Sep 23, 2003"
3.82,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Time out for a cup of coffee! Typical deep chestnut color. The head fades very fast. Aromas start malty, then quickly head towards coffee. In the mouth more coffee. The alcohol comes off slightly out of balance and overwhelms the flavor and warming richness of the style. Finishes with a bitter burt sugar note and a touch of sweet malt and raisin. A bit too carbonated-almost soda like-maybe they intended it for the root beer and it got mixed up? All in all a pretty good beer despite.","moulefrite","Apr 29, 2003"
3.4,-11.5,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and bready. A full-bodied bock.
