Big flavors of raisins, caramel, and black strap molasses.  As a doppelbock, it's got the appearance of a porter but the mouthfeel of a much lighter beer.

However, the caramelization of the wort on the hot stones during the steinbeer process does add a lot of depth and intensity to the malt flavor.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a dark brown body which left 2-finger head and lace. A strong, sturdy malt base smell as I pick up bread/cracker - a dryness, and also some sweetness and a touch of hoppy fruitiness. Strong, medium-bodied, a clear smoothness makes it easy to drink and there's a balance in the beer as it finishes crisp thanks to carbonation. A good malt base as I pick up that touch of dryness, but mostly a syrupy figgishness as well as some caramel and dark chocolate. Also some fruit flavors akin to dark fruit and/or black cherry. A quality dopplebock that isn't as heavy and the mildness makes it an easy to drink brew.","clayrock81","May 04, 2011"

Flavor is much of the same with sweet malt, raisin, prune, some crackery notes, and overcooked vegetables.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. An authentic German steinbier, I've been looking forward to this. Dark copper in color, cloudy, opaque. Ample carbonation feeds a lasting head. It's malty on the nose, heavily caramelized but also very earthy, mineral, almost metallic. Hops seem to be buried beneath it all. The palate shares the same mineral and earthy notes. It's semi-sweet, very caramelized though not as metallic as I was expecting. The use of hot granite in the wort does add a unique mineral quality to the beer, but it's not overwhelming. I enjoyed this far more than I was expecting.","largadeer","Sep 21, 2010"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I can see quite a few shades of brown in my glass right now. If you'd like a brief selection, grab the box of 96 crayons and read the sides of those that at least vaguely look brown. ...Or I suppose you could just look at a glass of Granitbock for yourself... Either way. I realize that I've been circumventing a real description, so I'll fill in some gaps by saying that the core is lovely dark mahogany and, as the eye prgrosses outward, this bleeds through a few shades into a rosy walnut. A deep haze pervades throughout. Not quite as pervasive is the aroma, though I've tended to find bocks somewhat lacking in the scent department. What's there is some weak cinnamon, brown sugar, and wheat. As weak as they have been for me, I have enjoyed their grainy/spicy quality. And, even better, this translates beautifully in the taste. Reprising their roles are the cinnamon, sugar, and wheat, but a woodiness and nuttiness are also present, culminating in a nice almond-laced aftertaste that lounges about for awhile, sinking into its newly-purchased muscular sofa. I feel this bit helps distinguish this particular brew from its similar cousins. The familiar familial traits of medium body, light carbonation, and sevefrely smooth feel are all here, and I think baldness is as well, but it's still too soon to know for sure. As much as I often feel bored with them, I always find myself enjoying my time with the Bocks, and now I have a new friend in Granit.","TMoney2591","Mar 09, 2010"

Super-rich nose of caramel, nougat, honeyed nuts, raisin bread, dried apple and pear fruit, cinnamon stick, there is a flinty to stone and tar element which distances itself from all the sweetness, highly credible lingering in the nostrils. Medium-bodied, the initial wave of sugary sweetness settles into a steady pulse and a drier finish. Still, replete with caramel, molasses, brown sugar, nuts, candied orange peels, bittersweet chocolate. The apple, pear fruit here has some plum and cherry in it but not much of a dried fruit character. The hops don't coalesce into distinct flavors at the end but texturally create more uprightness.

An average dopplebock, definitely on the sweet side as the dark fruit flavors are predominate. I would like to see a touch more of a roasted malt presence to add some depth.","Gmann","Dec 11, 2009"
3.04,-17.8,3,4,3,2,2.5,"It was interesting to try, and I'd try another "stone" beer, but the underlying bock has to be a little better to begin with. Not worth the price of admission ($5.49) for sure....","phisig137","Dec 04, 2009"
3.85,4.1,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Sweet brown sugar and caramel aroma. Very malty and only mildly toasty. The flavor follows suit, big brown sugary doppel flavors with little in the way of smoked flavor. It's chewy, rich, and supple with a mild apple flavor from the yeast. Not bad to try, it's a little too sweet for me to return to over drier Doppelbocks like Asam-Bock and Celebrator.","emerge077","Nov 09, 2009"
3.32,-10.3,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer that is a bit too sweet to drink quickly. If you are in the mood for a malty beer this one will work.","Gavage","Sep 27, 2009"

4.05,9.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I had this beer in a pilsner glass. It was a medium brown color with some red highlights. A medium sized tan head. Strong malt aroma, some dark fruit. Sweet. Big malt taste, sweet raisin. This was a chewy beer. It reminded me of the brown bread I used to eat with my baked beans. Very nice.","lordofthewiens","Aug 19, 2009"
4.1,10.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"$5.50 per .5L bottle at Knightly Spirits in Orlando, FL. This brew pours a clear, brownish/dark red, and there's a small, but lasting head. Carbonation leans toward the low side, but is not inappropriate for the style. There's a superb, rich, toffee aroma in this beer that most American breweries never come close to emulating when trying to brew a bock. The flavor is even richer than the aroma. The delicious bock flavor in this beer is also something which is rarely found in bocks brewed outside of Austria and Germany. I'm really digging the malty, caramelized toffee flavor of this brew. This is an incredibly smooth doppelbock and one of the best I've had in a while. There's a strong maltiness, but that's what I like in a doppelbock. A little more carbonation would make it less syrupy, but it's excellent just the way it is. This beer is too expensive, but it is a very good example of a traditional doppelbock.","ohmybock","Aug 18, 2009"
4.14,11.9,3,4,4,4,5,"Flavor is sweet malt through and through with caramel and toffee, some biscuity notes and a bit of brown sugar. Again no hops to be found, there is just a faint wisp of bitter alcohol on the finish, but overall this is a malt lovers beer. Not overly complex but certainly drinkable and enjoyable.","sulldaddy","Jul 12, 2009"

3.79,2.4,4,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Not really much to say about this one, unfortunately. It's a little on the dull side but good if you want to chug your doppelbocks, I suppose.","Lupin","Apr 07, 2009"
3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a light tea-like brown with a small tan head that recedes quickly and leaves traces of lacing. The aroma is dominated by the caramelized malts and fairly sweet with hints of a toasted character and spices in the back. The taste follows the aroma with caramel malts and a bit more sugary sweetness. The mouthfeel is light to medium for the style with decent carbonation. This is a very good bock and certainly original in the brewing process.","gford217","Apr 04, 2009"
4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the Brick Store Pub. According to the menu, "white hot granite stones are dropped into this brew to get its caramel smoothness". Others have done this as well, and it does taste somewhat similar. Pours dark chestnut with a very nice head and some decent lacing. Smells fruity and malty with clean caramel throughout. Tastes richly fruity with caramel, somewhat sweet, and with fairly sumptous flavors without being heavy. Some slight char on the finish, but light and clean thrroughout. Quite soft and creamy in the mouth. Pretty much as advertised, this was a nice change of pace. Nice.","Georgiabeer","Mar 10, 2009"

3.95,6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall this is a nice beer, though it's not as rich as some of the better doppelbocks. Still, I like the flavors and could have a lot of these if the ABV were a bit lower. Worth a shot, if for nothing else than the granite.","glid02","Beers"
