3.84,3.5,3,4,4,3,4,"Beer pours a clear ruby red to brown with a chubby reddish pink creamy head that settle quickly leaving the lace to cover the glass. Nose is that of over ripe cherries, caramel and with the malt present a cotton candy like sweetness, fresh and appetizing. Front has the pleasant malt sweetness, with the cherry like taste also present, light to medium in feel. Finish has a light to medium hop spiciness, sweet to the end with the acidity stunning, quite dry, a drinkable beer.","Gusler","Jul 29, 2007"

Kind of disappointing, most English bitters that I've had, I have really enjoyed but this was pretty much just standard fare. Nothing offensive, just a little bland for my tastes.","biggmike","Mar 27, 2007"

3.45,-7,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a deep chestnut color with modest off-white head. Smell is mainly of fruity malt with no hop character noted. Taste is also mainly malty with a bit too sweet fruity taste. Finishes with more sweetness and this sweetness begins to get a bit tiring. With no hop presence to balance the malt this is a very one-dimensional beer. Drinkable, but nothing great.","tgbljb","Jun 26, 2006"
3.37,-9.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,"This is a very pretty beer -- a nice hue of red. It has a small white head, and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is very nice -- almost smells like a rich red wine. The taste is bitter, but smooth. However, towards the end of the beer...the bitterness is a little overwhelming. Good to have one, but I wouldn't have more than that in one sitting.","oldirtycaffrey","Mar 03, 2006"

3.63,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste; that smokiness follows over in the taste, as well as a strong caramel maltiness. There's some nutty flavors and a touch of a spicy hop bitterness in the finish. The flavors definitely get better, and more pronounced as this warms. Reminds me of a bitter I had while in a pub in Gibraltar that I've long since forgotten the name of. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for me, but the drinkablility is good.","RedHaze","Aug 07, 2005"

3.31,-10.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: the mouthfeel overall is quite smooth and the body is in my opinion balanced, but this beer lacks somewhat exceptional elements to make it stand out as a really tasty pale ale or bitter.

3.83,3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"sampled this one on Nitro tap at the Brazen head in Brooklyn, NY, Arrives rudy/red/dark amber/cloudy with tiny bubbles clinging to the glass. Super fine, creamy head, loads of lacing left behind. Minimal nose picked up. This one is all about the mega creamy mouthfeel and the light subtle, drinkable approach taken towards this very British ale. Fine sessioner, could drink this stuff all night","Billolick","Apr 21, 2005"
2.83,-23.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Thanks to Darkover for the trade. What is this beer trying to strongarm exactly? This brew isnt going "over the top" any time soon. Dark amber color with a thin off-white head. Weak lacing. The aroma is malty in an indistinct way. Medum bodied and mildly bitter throughout. Some malt and nut flavors as well but Sylvester Stallone movie references aside, this beer doesnt offer much. The finish is dry and slightly hoppy. I wont bother with this again.","Dogbrick","Apr 17, 2005"
3.24,-12.7,4,2.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours a deep amber/ruby with a foamy white head which leaves some lacing on the glass. Some malt in the nose but rather clean. Sweet malt with faint fruity notes and a subtle hint of diacetyl coming through and then leading to a delicate long hop finish. A rather mild and unassuming pale ale. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable, but not terribly exciting.","foamer","Apr 08, 2005"

Toasted nuts and escarole skim a mahogany juice that doesn't not taste like a gulp of mineral water after cutting fallen hardwood with a chainsaw.

3.85,3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Dark red mahogany color with a decent yellowish head of 1/4 of an inch. Nice lacing on the glass, thin, but complete around the perimeter. Malty aroma, slightly musty and dusty but with a caramel and slight butter undertone. Lightish body but plenty of carbonation. Burnt caramelized sugar taste, creme brulee, bittering from English style hops early but matched by Heath bar toffee and a touch of wild honey. Thins a little mid mouth and closes on the light side, without nearly as much impact. Overall, I'd say this is a nice enough brew, good drinkability but the close is a little weak, making a little too much of a switch for me.","ADR","Nov 19, 2004"
3.58,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Had this brew on cask last evening while at Mahars. Must say that is it an interesting brew. The brew had a hazy amber color with a nice off white head that broke down very slowly and left some lacing. The aroma of this brew was of caramel and butterscotch malt. The taste does along with the aroma but you get a strong apple cider flavored finish. It took me a while to actually figure out what I was experiencing. A very different tasting brew! The flavor, even though different seemed to be weak or was missing something. Over all it was a nice brew and was very happy I got the chance to try it on cask. Would like to try it on tap to compare in the future.","Stimack","Nov 02, 2004"
4.21,13.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Overall, I was happily impressed with this offering, as I'd never tried anything from this brewer. For $3/pint, the price isn't bad and it was definitely worth the money to try it. Could be a good session beer if it was available around here in 6 or 12-packs.","hero27","Nov 01, 2004"

2.77,-25.3,2.5,3,3,2,2.5,"If I saw this next to a mass produced American beer (which I dislike), I would choose the Strongarm. At least it has some interesting aspects, at least more so than the mass produced junk.","karengarys","Jul 27, 2004"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a strong 4 in my eyes. The smell was nice and malty with hints of fruits. I was a little nervous, thinking that this one might have a lot of hops in it, but it's just the opposite. It's got a nice, solid malty backbone, which is something I really favor. The taste and the smell are quite similar to each other, which denotes consistancy. The taste was also very refreshing and actually quenched my thirst. All in all, a great beer. Go get some!","JISurfer","Beers"
3.86,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Hops make more of a statement, both in terms of flavor and bitterness, on the drying finish. The body is strictly medium for the style and I find myself wishing for more mouth-filling creaminess. Strongarm is quite the complex brew; amazing since it's only 4% alcohol. Who says that session beer can't be serious beer?","BuckeyeNation","0"
3.6,-3,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,4.5,"My only complaint on this beer is its flavor profile..

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This ale poured a hazy, reddish amber color with off-white foam that persisted. The smell was modest malt. The taste was slightly sweet malt with some tangy citrus notes and a low hoppiness. The body was medium with low carbonation. There was a lingering tangy malty flavor. This was an enjoyable ale from cask.","UncleJimbo","Apr 29, 2004"
3.59,-3.2,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beautiful reddish copper with a nice thick light tan head, and a glint of ruby at the bottom. Smells of butterscotch. Tastes of appley cidery fruit. The butter scotch becomes more and more phenolic as I drink. Strong cidery finish. Not to my taste, and disappointing after the lovely Castle Eden.","gentlebubbles","Apr 29, 2004"
3.97,7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice creamy malt scent that seems a bit dry. The taste is good. It has a light malty flavor that is enhanced with some mild hopping and a dry English style finish. It goes down easy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine red ale. It has good aroma and flavor; a good drinker.","WesWes","Mar 05, 2004"
3.09,-16.7,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours with a one-finger light tan head that goes slowly and leaves a good lace. Light carbonation. Nice clear, deep amber color. Nose has some malt. Starts and finishes with a balance of hops and malts with a little sweetness at the end. $3.00 for a 500ml bottle. Best by date Nov 04. The ABV is 4.0%.","jdhilt","Feb 17, 2004"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Super color here-deep caramel/amber with an enticing, creamy beige head that sticks throughout the journey-moderate to ample lace. Aromas are somewhat savory, with roasted grain and nut up front-some melon like fruit and tangy hop bitter on the tail end. The mouth feel is medium bodied, crisp and somewhat creamy. Flavors satiate, and are quite easy to swallow. The emphasis is on the roasted grain and the subtle, buzzing hop bitter that balances the beer in sublime English fashion. A flavorful, refreshing, and just right brew to serve up with a plate of fish and chips.","moulefrite","Jan 30, 2004"
4.13,11.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A slightly hazy chestnut body displays ruby highlights and streams of fine, steadily rising bubbles beneath an enormous head of creamy off-white foam. The head retention is excellent, and it leaves wide streaks of lace throughout most of the glass. The nose is mainly malty with a distinct caramel side and a touch of diacetyl, although some limited, grassy hops are able to slip through. The body is decidedly medium and its fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation leaves it smooth and creamy across the palate. The flavor reflects the caramel maltiness that's displayed in the nose with a splash of yeasty fruitiness (apples, pear, berries) and some subtle buttery diacetyl adding depth. It finishes soft and smooth; almost without notice. A straightforward, highly drinkable ale that could easily be enjoyed throughout an entire session!","NeroFiddled","Dec 01, 2003"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A tea-like and a citrusy hop bitterness, along with a mild metallic bite make for a nice balanced ale. A very light basil-like herbal flavor emerges as it warms. This is a highly gulpable brew!","BeerResearcher","Nov 22, 2003"
3.8,2.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer is very drinkable, but belgian beer has ruined me. I like stronger flavor and alcohol.","daledeee","Nov 15, 2003"
3.95,6.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Strongarm Ruby Red Ale, in a bottle (best by date 6/04). Hmm, pours not so much ruby or red, but a kind of brown, fairly clear. Had some head, but what there was left fairly quickly. The aroma is mild, but I can sense a little red wine aroma, of all things. Fairly clean and brisk English style ale, with a nip and bit more of hops. Bready malts help to round out the flavor, leaves a slightly toasty aftertaste. Crisp, easy to drink, and light bodied. Very nice, I can see this being enjoyed in the late afternoon at an English pub. Nice.","jackndan","Beers"
