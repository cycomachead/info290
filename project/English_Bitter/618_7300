A touch of diacetyl - simple and pleasant. Taste is a bit restrained, more lightly bready notes, some cracker, fruits but the richer earthier English malt notes on the nose weren't as pronounced on the palate. A bit watery, a bit from some carbonation and a modest hop bitterness. Light and relatively flavourful, I'm sure this is substantially more enjoyable fresh.

An all around great beer for all seasons. It would go well with dinner or be good for a hot day. It would be fine at the pub or to give to your buds at poker night. It would make a great session ale and is even good for cooking with. Certainly worth your time and at about $12.00 a six pack in Ontario this beer is well worth every penny.","TheHammer","Beers"

Recurrent themes of stark bitterness that seem sour and out of place, mingling with that ubiquitous maple-leaf flavor. Dusty, almost leathery hints as well. Went down fairly well but seemed ham-handed in use of maple. Relatively fat mouthfeel for such a smallish beer.","GreenWBush","May 24, 2005"

Not bad but there is some way better bitter out there.","Phyl21ca","Nov 20, 2004"

Sure, this beer is still damn good on tap, but it really shines on cask! Another world-class UK style beer is being brewed in Ontario!","francisweizen","0"

Malty flavour to start and hop bitterness becomes more apparent towards the finish. Medium/light body, and low carbonation helps keep it smooth. The finish is dry, with hops lingering on the palate. Great session beer.","DrJay","May 08, 2004"
3.98,9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pretty good, mild bitter. Appearance is kind of a dull sunset colour. Browns twingling with oranges. A 1 1/2 finger head that slowly settles to one finger at the finish. Small strings of lace coat the glass. Smells of caramel, barley, hops, apples(russet?) and ripe raspberries. Tastes a bit more bitter than the smell leads to believe. The malts are first, with the hops a close contender. Their is also a bit of toffee taste. Pleasantly balancing. The apples leave a somewhat sour aftertaste. Definite Granny Smith, but I still think their are some Russets in the mix. Mouthfeel is a little chewy and light. I would like to know what it'd be like with more body. One of those circumstances where more body could be an improvement, or fatal. Very drinkable. The light body makes for a good session beer, while the complex balances of taste and aromas leaves you curious for more. A good, nay, a terrific beer from Wellington. It's nice to know their is a brewery in Ontario that produces some quality beer.","slitherySOB","Feb 11, 2004"
4.22,15.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Another gem from the Wellington County Brewery. Beer must be consumed at room temperature to appreciate its essence. The terra cotta colour was quite intriguing for a bitter. The head lingered a tad too long, but once it subsided the plethora of hops came to the fore. I really enjoyed the chewy taste and the light smooth feel in swallowing. No apparent after taste. Not the "Best Bitter" I have every had, but not a bad bitter either.

Certainly a fine and solid brew that I may come back to when I want a session drinker.","the42ndtourist","0"
