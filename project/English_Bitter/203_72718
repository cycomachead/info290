I've always had a fondness for bitters, and even though I haven't had a new one in a while, this brew immediately reminded me why I love them so much.

Clear gold (aptly named) with a thin white head that nearly disappears. Oddly fruity - the mix of English yeast with Galaxy hops is certainly unique - lime stands out along with some peach and a grassy herbal note. Malt is minimal with a light graininess and a hint of corn. Just a hint of butter at the finish. Not a bad beer if you are looking for something low ABV. It was interesting to taste Galaxy hops in something besides a big, aggressive American ale.","bump8628","Mar 16, 2013"

The nose comprises light lemon peel, fluffy biscuit, light honey, light greens, and a hint of skunk (damn glass...). The taste brings in more of the same, but with a deeper vein of greens, this time closer to tobacco than anything. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.
