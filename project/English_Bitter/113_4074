Fits the style of an English Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of citrus. Overall, average appearance, aroma, and feel.","Tone","Jul 07, 2012"

3.69,0,4.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a lovely amber with a dense white head with firm bubbles from tap (Nitro, I believe, at a company pub in Oxford). The aroma has very low levels of earthy UK hops. This is a very estery beer, pears and apples. Raisiny caramel notes lead the flavor, with low levels of bittering hops complemented by low flavor hops and noticeable esters. The beer goes down smooth with a medium body.","mrandolph","Sep 17, 2007"
3.53,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On-cask at The Cock in London. Appeared a hazy golden yellow with a tall white head. Eh, nice and drinkable but a bit plain. The aroma is just a sharp, sweet mellon note and a plain bready flavor. Very drinkable and it fits well into the style Worth a try is you're into Sam Smith beers - but understand, this isn't at the same level as the Taddy Porter or Oatmeal Stout.","tempest","Jun 01, 2006"

3.58,-3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Warning: the same beer could be very bland when served on tap, over-chilled, or dispensed carelessly, in another Samuel Smith's pub with poor bar-training and cellarmanship, though.","wl0307","Dec 23, 2004"
3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear, rich orangey-amber with a nice creamy off-white head which leaves some lacing. Sweet and fruity malts in the nose, with discernable oak notes. Not too powerful, but present. Sweet malts up front with fruity notes of pear, green apple, and peach leading to a lingering earthy hop bitterness with definite oak overtones. Lovely. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable and quite refreshing.","foamer","Jun 27, 2004"
4.3,16.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Was excited to try a Sam Smith on cask, from a wood cask at that! Old Brewery Bitter was a solid copper color topped by a thin white head. lacing was smattered about and on the thin side. Sweet malt aroma is strong yet inviting. Sweet malt and hop is prevalent in a long finish. Seems well balanced and is very smooth and drinkable. Had it at the wonderful Citte Of York pub in London.","Mark","Jun 22, 2004"
3.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is "beer from the wood" drawn from an oak cask! An orange/ amber color with a light beige head. The aroma was lighty sweet with a hint of apple. A malty sweetness starts out on the tip of the tongue. Followed by an even smooth bitterness througout the rest ot the tongue. This is one the very few beers that are still served from oak casks. I know because I saw the Cooper making the casks a the brewery.","ybnorml","Apr 12, 2004"

2.53,-31.4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This beer had a unique taste, bitter is definitely the operative term, as this beer is very bitter. I liked it OK, but could not drink more than one in a sitting. Mouthfeel is similar to sucking on a lemon, the beer's appearance is intriguing. I wonder if this is a more popular beer in the UK, where it probably compliments the blander taste of the food there.","Trentonator","Jun 07, 2003"
2.92,-20.9,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer had a medium sized head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles.The hue of this beer was orange and it produced a decent lacing on the sides of my glass.To me it has a fruity, citrusy nose.This is definitely a bitter tasting beer.This is not my favorite style of beer; however, it wasn't that bad.","hotstuff","Apr 17, 2003"
4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this in what was supposed to be the oldest pub in London: the "Old Cheshire Cheese". The beer was a rich copper color. A bit of a lingering head. There was a slightly sweet maltiness to the aroma. There was as full, malty taste to this one, with a hine of bitterness coming through at the end. Very Good!","Boto","Beers"

4.05,9.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: I was in heaven getting Samuel Smith on tap. A truly amazing experience. This beer goes down smooth, and with the relatively low alcohol content of 4.% abv, you could drink these all night (speaking from experience). I think I paid 2 pounds 50 pence per pint (roughly $3.75), and it was worth every cent. If you find yourself in London anytime soon, check out Cittie of Yorke.","cbl2","Aug 05, 2002"

2.06,-44.2,3,2,2,2,2,"Pretty ordinary, sweet creamy mouthfeel, Ok maltiness, not much bitterness, not much hoppyness, smooth aswell and tasted very very flat, lacks bite and once again this is a bit to sweet and creamy for me.","rastaman","Beers"
3.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Had the pleasure of drinking this brew in one of the oldest pubs in London, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese. OBB as it's referred to in the UK, is not available in the US. Golden peach color with a thin layered head. Light, multi-grain bread aroma. Toasted malt, trace fruit and faint hop aroma. Lightly toasted malt is again present in flavor along with a skillfully reserved hop finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. A fine, flavorful, easy drinking bitter.","John","0"
