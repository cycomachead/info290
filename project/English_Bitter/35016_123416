While this one is not the best I've had it is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. You definitely get that malty ,bready, biscuit flavor, which I love. Not much lacing and mouthfeel was a little thin but over all I enjoyed this beer. I forget the price but it wasn't expensive. This will certainly end up in my fridge many times.","trebbates","Feb 02, 2015"

3.95,14.8,3.25,3.75,4,4.5,4,"Overall. I don't think CAMRA would approve as this is in the can. I had the pleasure of having this on tap and it was much improved by the change in format. Even in the can there is a taste of London. Much fainter in the can, but take an average person to a Pub in London and serve them 4 proper pints and this; I doubt most would be able to pick it out. Worth a try!","HardTarget","Jan 06, 2015"
3.94,14.5,3,4,4.25,3.5,3.75,"Enough poetic waxing! The Crack! was nice and loud so I celebrated with an inverted Glug. This caused the formation of two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, eggshell-white head with decent retention. I was fascinated to watch it slowly fall, leaving dense, sticky lacing in its wake. Who is going to clean that up? Color was a hazy Amber (SRM = > 7, ","woodychandler","Jan 01, 2015"
3.46,0.6,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sampled from the can.  Pours bright gold and not quite clear.  Huge fluffy white head. Nose is remind one of a lemon tart.  Flavor is bright, malty with a bit of lemon and grass in the back.  While not stunning, very refreshing and clean.  A nice take on this classic British style.","mschantz","Dec 26, 2014"

4.25,23.5,,,,,,"On the whole, I think Oasis hit this one out of the park. I have yet to drink anything else from them, but this particular offering stands out among most other recent Austin/Texas upstarts. I love having a local bitter in cans for the times I want something a little more subtle and sessionable than other great locals like Zoe and Four Squared, and even Real Ale White.","Riccymon","Sep 13, 2014"

2.5,-27.3,,,,,,"Pours out hazy and much like a SNPA in color.  Nose is very subdued.  I don't get a whole lot of English character from the smell.  Flavor reminds me of green homebrew.  Yeast is a bit heavy handed, but not in a tasty British way.  Malt leaves a lot to be desire: a bit of toast and too grainy for me.  Hops give it a grassy and citrusy quality.  Carbonation is a touch out of hand.  Overall, this is somewhat passable, but I expected more.","goochpunch","Aug 23, 2014"
