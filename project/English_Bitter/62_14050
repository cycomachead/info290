There's a dryness in the aftertaste that I'm attributing to an over spicyness. Just as too much cinnamon doesn't taste good without the right amount of sugar, so too, the spices here are unbridled. All that malt & spice w/no sugar creates a bitter aftertaste that's off putting.","seedyone","Aug 16, 2014"

It has a golden amber color and a nice white head. The beer starts with a sweet malt and with a slightly harsh carbonation that brings out the earth hop flavor. The hop flavor is more of a pale ale flavor, but the buttery malt makes is a real English style. What I love about this beer is it's not traditional. Geary's is smart why try and make another dark ale as the HSA and porter are some of the best beers ever created.","bishopdc0","Mar 26, 2010"

Taste is similar, sweet and toasty at first, some honey, oats and biscuit, floral, light fruitiness, lightly musty, balanced finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation.

The bittering hop lasts too long into the finish and aftertaste.

It has a fresh hop aroma that is predominantly green apple and sweet fruit on top of an underlying caramel malt base. Moderate, to moderately light body and carbonation combine to give it a slightly thin mouth feel. Yet, it has pleasant hop flavors and lingering bitterness to assure you that you're drinking an English IPA.

It's just a bit bigger than a pale ale, not particularly caramelish at all, and not as bitter as what most think of when they think IPA. However, Geary's Winter is an authentic representation of an English style IPA, or what they used to be until just recently when some of the younger breweries started bumping up their hop charges. A solid brew across the board!","NeroFiddled","Mar 04, 2007"

3.5,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear, coppery in hue with a brassy shine as well, the color is lovely. The head was white in color; at the apex the foam reached one finger in height before quickly dissipating to a fizzy cap. There wasnt much subsequent lacing. There isnt much noteworthy about the appearance of this beer. The nose is pleasant, earthy from an English hop influence. Must be Golding and Fuggles. Light citrus notes. The malt construction is equally English. Caramel. Bread. Yeast must be Ringwood. Fruity. Buttery. I found an occasional whiff of alcohol. The potency is modest but the nose is plenty articulate; it helps I like what it is saying. The bouquet is organized just right; Im impressed. Inviting. The palate follows the path the nose setout. Honesty is the best policy, right? I hate beers that lie. This one didnt, so Ill be honest too. The palate isnt as good as the nose, mainly because I dont understand what is going on. Its a bit of a mess. Fruity and spicy at times, there is heat that comes from the alcohol and, it would seem, the yeast. Its like a candy heat; this clashes with the caramel/toffee malt. Hops offer grassy, earthy flavors that do work with the malt and with the buttery, fruity, dirty yeast to a lesser degree. Vague notes of citrus. A suggestion of leaves. Dry at the finish. Woody and sweet. Odd. Overall the palate is okay, it lacks richness what is there to sink my teeth into? Not much. Also, on what planet is this an IPA? I reviewed this bottle without this knowledge and my numbers are based on what I tasted. If I reviewed this as an IPA I would have ripped this beer. My point is this, there is nothing bad about the taste and there are good points too but there isnt anything special about it. Of course not every winter seasonal needs to be a high alcohol/spice/hopped beer; that is not what Im suggesting. This beer is okay. Just okay. Around medium in body, the carbonation is on the low side but the mouthfeel is still decent. It works. Sure, this beer is drinkable. Id have little problem drinking a six-pack of this. If this were a local beer Id buy it yearly. Its a simple but lovely quaff. Thanks ppoitras for the bottle, it was a welcomed addition to the 2004 Secret Santa!","bditty187","Dec 27, 2004"
