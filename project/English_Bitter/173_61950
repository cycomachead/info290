4.13,16,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"O: So damn drinkable! Truly a sessionable beer, low alcohol and bold flavors (and cheap draft price, too!) would keep me returning to this again and again. As a 'small beer', this may not be to everyone's liking, but I'm fascinated by it and will continue to enjoy it as long as Alan and crew keep brewing Fred, Doggie Claws, Adam, etc.","msubulldog25","May 30, 2011"
3.97,11.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Seems more like a veritable Continental pils, and a good one at that. The lower booze (to no apparent detriment) provides a nice offset to the other higher octane offerings from this brewery.","biboergosum","Feb 23, 2011"
2.71,-23.9,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O: Average. Second runnings of Doggie or Fred may be good for some but not this guy. Not a fan and I prefer the first runnings and I dont see how this could be classified as an APA either.","barleywinefiend","Dec 17, 2010"

3.97,11.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Gotta love a great sessionable beer by HotD. This small beer from the second runnings of a Doggie Claws batch poured vibrant, hazy golden/yellow with a white head. Floral hops on the nose with a biscuity grain character. Cascade hops maybe? Very floral, earthy, aromatic, piney. Cracker-like, toasted grains. Smooth drinking, great hop presence.","boMD","Sep 19, 2010"
