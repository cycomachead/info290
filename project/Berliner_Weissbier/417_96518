It's not the newfangled, sour 6%ers, but a traditional Berliner Style wheat with low alcohol, loads of flavor, and a brightness with no end. Buy this beer if you see it, it holds up very well.","joe1510","Oct 07, 2014"

My poor rating won't hurt though because there is a pretty strong group that likes Star of the North.  It's the only offering from Schell's I haven't enjoyed so there's plenty of options for me.","BeerSnobRobinson","Sep 13, 2014"

I was very surprised to see how highly this was rated here. I am not a beer expert necessarily but I drink beer in the $10-$18 / 12 pack so I don't drink swill either. I expected this to be like other wheat beers I have had and enjoyed, namely a Paulaner Hefe or others that I have had. I do not want to be too harsh because this may very well be (and by the reviews I believe it is) exactly how this beer should look and taste, but I have to say this tastes similar to stomach bile to me, specifically the taste of regurgitating beer when having a few too many. So anyway this did not agree with my palette and I won't be buying it again. For those of you who like this I say awesome, and thanks for supporting my local brewer :).","Jackmn","Sep 01, 2013"

Some bready malt sweetness on the nose, but mostly a lactic/citric tart aroma. Smells great. When you first drink there is some malt sweetness that is slightly bready and even slightly fruity, although I found it hard to nail this down. This was replaced very quickly though by a clean tartness that I found very well balanced and by no means over whelming. Thinking green apples and champagne. Nice dry finish. The tart lingers nicely and there is a touch of funk in the after taste that could be attributed to either the yeast or the old Cypress tanks the beer was aged in. The body is light and easy drinking although perhaps under carbonated. This beer is fantastic, both my wife and I loved it. A great summer beer. For a Schells product I was floored. Not that they are a bad brewery, but this is far above the bar for them. I am headed back to the bottle shop for a few more of these.","jreindl","Jul 27, 2013"

4.27,0.5,4.5,3.75,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: a wonderful beer and if more people drank it, it could turn them on to the style. I love finding refreshing and crisp beers that are full flavored and sessionable. Can have a few and not stumble around. Well done Schell's.","scoand","Jul 16, 2013"
4.52,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall, this beer is spot on. I know I am not a b-weisse expert, but this tastes very German and authentic. I am a big fan of this. It is so easy to drink and provides way more flavor than you would expect from a 3.5% beer. A must try.","mothman","Jul 15, 2013"

4.29,0.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.25,"Happy that Schell's did a proper Berliner Weissbier instead of the half-hearted attempts by most other brewers. I am definitely going to pick up another bottle and let it sit for a year or two as I think this will develop into a real fascinating beer.","morimech","Jul 12, 2013"

4.18,-1.6,4,4.75,4,4,4,"Overall: Perfectly balanced. Fresh and clean with just enough bread, cracker, and sour apple to make it interesting. Seems like a good pairing would be any cheese with penicillin, a good crisp pale cracker, and a slice of granny smith or mulberries.","beachscrat","0"
