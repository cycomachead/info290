It's not the newfangled, sour 6%ers, but a traditional Berliner Style wheat with low alcohol, loads of flavor, and a brightness with no end. Buy this beer if you see it, it holds up very well.","joe1510","Sep 13, 2014"

My poor rating won't hurt though because there is a pretty strong group that likes Star of the North.  It's the only offering from Schell's I haven't enjoyed so there's plenty of options for me.","BeerSnobRobinson","Aug 27, 2014"
