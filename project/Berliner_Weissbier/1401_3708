3.45,-0.6,3,3,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pale yellow, quickly vanishing noisy white head. Smell of lemon and bread. Taste lemony, very sour. Aftertaste doesn't stay for long. Refreshing. OK, but not my style. Much more sImilar to Gose (but it's not salty) than Hefeweizen or WItbier.","hansavijaticar","Nov 08, 2014"
3.39,-2.3,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Bowl. Bottle. Pale yellow, little hazy. White almost vanishing white head. No lacing at all. Very light aroma of straw, grains, but mainly dominated by sharp lemon and apple notes. Taste is sour (sharp lemon, some grapefruit). Dry, sharp, light body, above average carbonation, thin texture. In overall refreshing and crispy beer.","BlazerT","Nov 01, 2014"
