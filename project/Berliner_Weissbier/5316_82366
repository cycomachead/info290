3.65,6.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light orange straw amber. Minimal head, but a ring around the glass with slight slippery lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, light citrus and a lactic hint. Flavor starts with tart lemony wheat and develops into a light biscuit malt, wheat and lemon. The tartness is dominant, and other flavors are subdued. Light bodied, but nice mouth feel with sharp active carbonation. A refreshing, understated weissbier with a balanced amount of lactic tartness.","LiquidAmber","Jul 05, 2012"

3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"One finger white rapidly dissipating head over straw gold clear body, champagne like effervescence quickly leading to some clinging bubbles on side of glass, and a few small bubbles rising from bottom of etched glass. The lacto is fairly prevalent in the nose, wet hay and a bit of sourness. Taste is a bit more tart than sour though the finish will make you pucker up, lemony, clean light wheat, no hops to speak of. Mouthfeel well on the light side of medium, about right for style, decent effervescence. Could have used some more conditioning but at this price point certainly a good value. Worth a try.","jdense","Jul 01, 2012"
3.78,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"o - Overall a pretty nice berlinerweiss; cool to see them doing things like this. The nose is definitely a bit funky, while the taste has more sour citrus and lemon. Wheat is present throughout, and it is easy to drink. Would have it again.","mdfb79","Jul 01, 2012"

3.65,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours a delicate light yellow with the slightest diaphanous overcast. Fleeting foam atypical of the style. Smells of wheat, co2, lemon must, hay and some hints of lactic acid. Light and crisp smelling. Lightly tart with a wheaty sweetness and finishing corn flavors. The tartness is upfront and surprisingly transient. The finish is longer than I had anticipated with grain and grass with a hint of dry tartness (like I just swallowed some plain yogurt). A little heavy for the style with moderate carb and a wet finish. Clocking in at 4%, this is on the low end for US Berliner's, but the high end for Berlin. I like this version, although I'm guessing it isn't natural lacto, nor is there any Brett, so the beer really does merit a "best by". Nonetheless, I'm not put out by the offering. Certainly worth the $5 I paid.","harrymel","Jun 25, 2012"

3.68,7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: Not the most complex Berliner in the world, but it is very much to style in ABV and taste. Plus at less than $4 a bomber, the price is right for those who want to get into this style, which for some reason is much more expensive than it should be.","Halcyondays","Jun 17, 2012"
