This did not hold up, but even still I doubt it was very good in the first place. Not tart enough and seriously lacking substance all around.","ryan1788a5","Feb 25, 2014"

Not nearly sour enough either, just a light lemon squeeze is all I am getting. Its more like an unsweetened radler and less like a berliner. I'll easily finish my bomber, but even at the modest price of $5, I wont be going back for more. A shame too, because I would loooove to have an affordable , decently sour berliner available here.","twiggamortis420","Oct 23, 2013"
