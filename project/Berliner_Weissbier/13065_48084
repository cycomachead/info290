2.35,-40.4,3.5,1,2,4,3.5,"This beer was falsely advertised as an "intensely sour wild ale" but the beer isn't sour at all! I mean, not one bit of tart was tasted. The pour is nice without foam and the beer is still a smooth one. If you're looking for a sour, skip this brew. But, if you're looking for a day time or summer beer then this one is a go.","TheBrewBrotha","Dec 21, 2014"
4.04,2.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Tastes like the after taste of a war head. Very bitter. Easy drink. Low alc level. No complaints but not blown away either, 4/5 is a fair assessment. Almost tastes like champagne. If I want to continue my night can't go for 9% so it's a very solid option at one mile house","Mikefriedman90","Dec 13, 2014"
