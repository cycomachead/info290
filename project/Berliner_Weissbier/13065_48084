Subtle and soft lactic sourness hits the nose and palate first. Lemon juice, grass, and a background note of earth and herb (from the lemon verbena?). A smooth vein of musky funk runs through the beer and adds a nice complexity. Another wave of tartness hits the back of the palate on the swallow. Really nice and refreshing, but still plenty complex. Certainly inspired by Berliner Weiss, but this beer brings a little something else. Well done.","bump8628","Jun 01, 2012"

Mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this was an awesome beer that I was not expecting to be as great as it was. To me, this is more like a berliner weissbier than a wild ale. Highly drinkable.","DovaliHops","Oct 13, 2011"

4.2,6.6,4,4,4.5,4,4," crisp, clean, tart aroma quickly fills the air. Hints of apples, light touches of citrus, a light bready note all combine to form this crisp, clean profile Wonderful tart green apples blending with hints of light orange peel and lemon. Herbal grasses fill the profile mid palate and give it that depth but flowery notes keep it light and airy. Super quick, clean and dry finish leaves a tart flavor on the tongue that will not go away. So light and refreshing","mikesgroove","Jul 07, 2011"

Chip was always a crisp jolly individual who could somehow out-harvest the others, and outsow his colleagues at planting time. “Toot doot dee do da dee dee daaa” he whistled some antiquated tune to himself, smiling in between breaths. “COME ON, DAMNIT CHIP!” One co-worker threw his rake down in anger. “Here we are trying to harvest some damn wheat and instead we have you all up in our heads with your old show tunes and knock knock jokes, don’t none of that make this any sooner!” Chip’s smile slowly faded and he looked down at his glistening pitchfork, “don’t let them get sore at you old Chip, don’t let what happened before ever happen again,” the darkness in his heart burned. “Well sure fellas!

3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Tasted from 750mL bottle at Lush Roscoe. Pours pale golden with a decent but quickly receding white head. Smell is sour and funky with tart fruits.

3.82,-3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a pale hazed straw golden color with a quickly dissipating large fizzy bone white head. Head settles into a thick ring and thin film of tiny bubbles with light streaks of lacing. Aroma is mildly lactic and sour, with strong notes of banana, wheat, citrus rind, lemon, florals and light pepper. Body is very light and fluffy with extremely active, sharp carbonation which nicely complements the lactic and lemon sourness. Flavor is much less of a typical wheat beer than the nose would have suggested. Lemon zest dominates the flavor, with some hints of the sweet malt and yeast. Very berlinner weissy (well, a very sweet one) and highly drinkable and refreshing, but the overly effervescent body combined with oppressive lemon and lactic flavors obliterate most of the wheat presence. I enjoyed this a lot more than my score suggests since this was very unique, but the balance and composition misses the mark for me.","yourefragile","Jul 25, 2010"
4.3,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I love the idea of a sour wheat- I think the lactic notes of a Berliner Weiss work very well, so why not Brett notes as well. Pours a hazy golden with a good, but loose head and lots of carbonation. The Brett is certainly active in this bottle. Smells lemony, lactic, and herbal. The taste is a very nice blend of lemon, herbs, and sharp, quick lactic notes, followed by a long salty minerality and the barest bit of barnyard. Very nice. Perhaps a little overcarbonated, but lemony and refreshing in the mouth. Overall, I think this works quite well. It retains the refreshing nature of a wheat beer but adds some funky complexity.","Georgiabeer","Jun 29, 2010"

3.84,-2.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,4.5,"D - Insanely drinkable. Drinks more like a saison than a sour/lambic. Small compensation for the mouthfeel, in my opinion, but is definitely an upside. I could have had another 750ml; it was that drinkable.","ebin6","Jun 06, 2010"

The mouthfeel is certainly not thin, but it is not a creamy wheat taste from a normal wheat ale. That part disapointed my drinking buddy. I got some brett, some herbal lemony flavour, and it was most drinkable to me. It is unique. Light colour with substantive bubbly white head.","Sammy","Mar 06, 2010"
3.94,0,3,4,4,4,4,"D: Easy to drink, considering it is brewed with wild strains of yeast and bacteria. Note that this beer is not aged in wine barrels, unlike many of the more high-profile american wild ales. It reminds me of RR Sanctification, with wheat added. The rich wheat backbone is very well represented here and it makes me want to try a traditional (non-sour) wheat beer by this brewery. There is a lot here to like, get it if you can.","beagle75","Mar 06, 2010"

3.82,-3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, with with acidic citrus tickling the tongue on the finish.","weeare138","Jul 12, 2009"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"75cl bottle. Lightly hazy yellow with a medium white head. The aroma is super complex, with spice, citrus, funk, sweet bread, wheat, and doughy yeast. The flavor is not as sour as the aroma suggests, with a light tartness that plays with some sweet, doughy malt to give off a lemon pastry impression. Bready with some light spice as well. Medium bodied with some spritzy bubbles. While this isn't as sour as I was expecting, it's a damn pleasant and drinkable wheat beer.","bulletrain76","Jun 28, 2009"
3.92,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours a slightly hazy light gold color, much darker than a typical German Berliner Weisse. Lactic lemon zesty aroma with candied citrus and some sort of unidentifiable spiciness. Hard to stop smelling this one. Flavor is wheaty with lemon meringue, slight banana pith, coriander(?), and a wheat malt finish. Solid tartness. Nice robust flavor and body.","illidurit","Jun 28, 2009"
3.78,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D: A very nice Berliner from Telegraph, a beer to compare with the Bruery's for the best I've had in Southern California. Not the greatest drinkability as it is heavy in a way at times, but a refreshing, interesting beverage nonetheless.","Halcyondays","Jun 13, 2009"
4.1,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Tasty enough and certainly dry and quenching. The tartness stays fairly level throughout and never builds to what I would consider "sour". More funk and sourness would be welcome on this end.","brewandbbq","Jun 08, 2009"
3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy, light gold in color with a nice inch or more of frothy head. Smell is wheat, yeast and some lemon zest. Taste is more of the lemon flavor as well as some clove. This is perfect for a hot, humid spring day. There's just a hint of bitterness and some sort of citrus in the middle of each sip. Very refreshing. Very full and creamy on the mouthfeel. This is a real easy beer to drink. Quite the fact that it is gone too fast. This is a really good beer and the first that I've had from Telegraph Brewing.","FtownThrowDown","May 27, 2009"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A bit more simplistic than I was expecting, the Brettanomyces character is really quite muted at this time; this would have been a welcome boost to the complexity of this brew and perhaps this will develop a bit more with time. If the yeast character was a bit more interesting I would almost call this a great example of a Saison (though it does lean a bit more towards a clean Berliner Weiss); it is light and refreshing and the lactic character adds a nice touch but is not overwhelming.","Gueuzedude","May 11, 2009"
4.65,18,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"D- I can drink a whole bottle of this easily and still want more. I have no idea what the ABV is on this beer but I would love to put this back all afternoon during a hot summer day.","MiScusi","Apr 27, 2009"
3.92,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle labled bottled on 1/12/09. Poured a medium and hazy yellow color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of wheat, cereal, and lighter citrus. Tastes of citrus, wheatiness, cereal, and lighter spices. Lighter tart finish.","hopdog","Apr 26, 2009"
3.96,0.5,4,3,4,4,5,"T: Overriding sourness, but strangely slick with a complete lack of puckering - which I find impressive! Perhaps the easiest sour beer I've had yet. Sweet, tangy lemon from beginning though mid until a grassy-ness tries to fight through, only to be overpowered by the tang. Finishes clean with only slight lingering flavor.","weazal","Apr 03, 2009"
3,-23.9,3,3,3,3,3,"D: Easily drinkable. I usually take a little more time when drinking a beer, but I find myself taking bigger mouth-fulls of this one, so it's going down pretty easy and fast.","djaeon","Mar 31, 2009"
3.68,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Easy drinker. Light, not a lot of mid or finish. Ok nose with slight funk and very slight sour. Maybe a beer to intro people to this style. But ver light and not complex. Though with 3-6 months of bottle conditioning age I could see a bit more happening. There are others in this style I'd rather pick up.","paytoplay","Mar 21, 2009"
4.3,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Very drinkable, very refreshing. Compared to the German versions I've tried, this beer is more accessible. It's almost like they blended a small amount of an APA or another mild style into it. The Berliner Weissbier tang is there, but there was little actual pucker in my mouth. I hope that more American breweries take up this style if they can achieve results like this. Then again, I wonder how much my reaction is from just being able to have this beer very fresh, while the German beers suffer from the time lag of importing. In any event, I hope that people try this beer and realize that it's a style that has the potential for returning to popularity among American palates.","popery","Mar 17, 2009"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"If you want something more complex and floral, try the 1809. If you want something with way more lactic sourness, try the Bruery Hottenroth.","rallison","Mar 17, 2009"
