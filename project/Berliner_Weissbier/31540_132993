4.38,3.3,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall, this beer is fairly sour, but not so much as to be distracting. This really reminds me of an adult lemonade, perfect for quenching your thirst on a hot day. The kiwi gives the base berliner an added level of complexity and really improves the overall flavor of the beer.","boilermakerbrew","Dec 20, 2014"

Fairly sour flavor, some kiwi fruit, green and lemony, wheat and light yeast.  Medium thick, highly carbonated body with a puckering, milky finish.","yourefragile","Beers"
