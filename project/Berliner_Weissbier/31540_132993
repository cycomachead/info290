4.38,3.3,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall, this beer is fairly sour, but not so much as to be distracting. This really reminds me of an adult lemonade, perfect for quenching your thirst on a hot day. The kiwi gives the base berliner an added level of complexity and really improves the overall flavor of the beer.","boilermakerbrew","Dec 08, 2014"
