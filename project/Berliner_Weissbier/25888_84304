3.91,3.2,3.25,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours very cloudy, was a little turbid but not in a bad way. I felt like it was more like that and it had a kind of creamy/heavy mouth feel because they used real peaches in the brew so there was pulp in it. Smelled like peaches (surprise). It was more sour than any other berliner weisse I've ever had and it lacked a funkyness characteristic that i get when I drink 1809 so I don't know if I would really call this a Berliner but I would compare it more to Pizza Boy Peach Funker which is an American Wild because of the sourness and mouth feel. If you see this it is definitely worth a try, not the best peach sour I've had but it is a solid beer.","caffeineTX","Feb 16, 2015"
