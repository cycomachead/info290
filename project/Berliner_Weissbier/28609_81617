4.09,7.1,4,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Another excellent example of why Night Shift is known for its sours. Lemon grass and other citrus flavors and aroma are striking over a biting, slightly astringent, sourness. Barnyard aromas are detectable under the heavy citrus aroma, suggesting that this beer was made with a small Brett component, in addition to the more common souring techniques for Berliner Weisse. This may have arisen through contamination from their American Wild Ales or been deliberately added. The resulting flavor/aroma seems out of place in this beer, though it remains one of the better Berliner Weissebiers I have had.","dabarton","Jan 01, 2015"
