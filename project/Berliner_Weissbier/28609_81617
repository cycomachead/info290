4.09,7.1,4,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Another excellent example of why Night Shift is known for its sours. Lemon grass and other citrus flavors and aroma are striking over a biting, slightly astringent, sourness. Barnyard aromas are detectable under the heavy citrus aroma, suggesting that this beer was made with a small Brett component, in addition to the more common souring techniques for Berliner Weisse. This may have arisen through contamination from their American Wild Ales or been deliberately added. The resulting flavor/aroma seems out of place in this beer, though it remains one of the better Berliner Weissebiers I have had.","dabarton","Jan 05, 2015"

4.12,7.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a chalky, pale yellow with hints of light orange and green. The beer pours with a nice head of soda-like white bubbles. In body the beer is very cloudy and impenetrable to the eye, though light and bubbly. On the nose, the beer smells beautifully funky, almost like a lambic with leather and cherry hints beside bright citric lemon and a touch of spicy ginger. The more you stick your nose in the beer, the richer the funk smell becomes and the more nuances you detect. It smells delectable and complex. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart and puckering with big acidity at the forefront of the taste. As the beer moves over the tongue, however, a nice balancing sweetness blankets the tongue and cushions it from the harsher bite of the acid. Faint, herbal saltiness can also be detected on the edges of the palate. In flavor, the beer begins as huge citric lemon with deep fruity notes that lightly hint at cherry, but mostly suggest the complexity of a well-crafted lemonade. Subtle ginger spice tingles across the middle of the swallow, and brings some really nice, ginger ale-like flavors to the finish alongside tart lemon and light wheat flake flavors that quench down the tartness. The aftertaste is lightly citric with lemon fruit and soft wheat flake flavors. In the mouth, the beer feels light in body, but sharp in carbonation with a good strong scrub and a solid pucker from the acid. The mouth is left with a light ringing pucker and some nice balancing saliva that doesn’t completely flood the mouth with fluid. Overall, this is a supremely crafted American Weisse with a great amount of Berliner Weisse in it. The citrus and wheat flavor of the classic Berliner are still in this beer, but it is far fruitier and more complex than a traditional Berliner Weisse, making the beer fascinating to drink. This beer is light and refreshing, and makes one hell of a summer beer. Try it!","Maxwell","Aug 07, 2013"

Well-rounded taste, clean and fresh (would be good in the summer, though I did have this in the winter), lemongrass, citrus zest, a twinge of tartness, pale malts, and a dash of gingery spice. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, very enjoyable overall. My favorite of the NS brews I sampled.","Rifugium","Feb 09, 2013"
