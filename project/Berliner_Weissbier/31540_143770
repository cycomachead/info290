The apricot seemed to be there a bit more than the peach, but both were so there. Stellar stuff, the best of the day which is saying a lot. We also joked that a beardless man has probably never stepped in the place. Virtually true, I'm sure. :D Cheers,","Rutager","Feb 12, 2015"

4.44,-3.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The palate opens with a pleasant fruity tartness and flavor, glorious in how bright it is. Focused heavily on the apricot, it approaches Fou'foune in intensity. Semi-ripe peach character is present on the mid-palate with a mild peachy, vanilla like character. Yogurt and buttermilk are present towards the finish. The palate is just a shade green, but that's driven by how driven it is by the apricot flavors - I occasionally get a mild sulfury note from stone fruit, especially if I eat too much too soon, and this beer has those characteristics. Light in body, crisply (but not overly so) carbonated, this beer is a treat on the palate. Highly recommended. Given my love for apricots, I think I just might prefer this over the also excellent Berry Bu that preceded it.","DefenCorps","Jan 24, 2015"
