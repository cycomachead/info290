3.85,-9.2,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,4,"Verdict: A nice berliner from Bend Brewing, perhaps a bit too sour for my tastes, but the hibiscus is showcased well, decently balanced, but I'd like to see a bit more pomegranate in this. All in all, this is quite a refreshing and enjoyable beer, definitely would be a go to if I was local for summer sessions.","kevanb","Mar 05, 2015"

Flavor is also too sweet, again virtually no grain, not as lacto/brett heavy, but becomes even sweeter lemon and candied sugar.  Body isn't super light, carb is pretty spot on, gets a little juicy.","cpetrone84","Dec 26, 2014"
4.16,-1.9,4,4.25,4.25,3.5,4.25,"this is excellent and real unique beer, i think the pomegranate comes through more in this neon pink colored berliner weisse than in any other beer made with the fruit i have had. the hibiscus is an accent flavor and aroma, rather than something perfumy and overbearing. the two actually go quite well together, and this beer is very sour. its got a puckery tart nose, lactic acid and lemon notes for sure, and then the fruit and flowers over the top of it. the sourness is really developed in the taste too, insanely tart in the finish especially. refreshing, but my one real critique of this thing is that it cant hold a head and that its carbonation is super light, it just doesnt feel like a berliner for that reason, ive said before, i really prefer my wild ales to be effervescent. not that its flat, but it just doesnt sing like it could and give life to the unique flavors. great fruit flavor though, and a really interesting finish. this is a beer unlike most others, and probably my favorite fruited berliner i can recall.","StonedTrippin","Dec 15, 2014"

There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

It is more of a sour beer than a Berlinner Weisse, but I have no complaints about the overall picture in reguards to Ching Ching. This beer was brewed with pomegranates and hibiscus, I didnt feel that either of those elements translated into the nose or flavor profile of the beer, but I do not really care at all because it that great of a beer. My advice to Bend Brewing Company is dont change a thing with this beer.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jun 01, 2014"

An easy swirl kept the head going. Aroma was lacto, some light grains, pomegranate seeds and wildflowers. A little bit soapy, but that's probably not the beer's fault...it has been sitting in the fridge for several months. That said, the tartness really held up here in the taste, and there was quite a bit of puckering on the first sip, light but sour fruit notes--pomegranate, lemon, cranberry, raspberry--saliva-inducing acidity, tangy, dry grassiness, with a rock candy sweetness in the background. I'm really glad the flavor didn't fade on this one. Light-medium body, crisp, tart mouthfeel, super tasty and super drinkable. Lots of fruit character without being syrupy or cloying.

There is a sharpness to the palate, clearly lactic but with a touch of white wine vinegar as well. Sharp lactic sourness, like really sharp yogurt on the finish with minimal wheat flavors.

The floral notes from hops and hibiscus were prominent in the nose along with huge dose of pomegranate syrup. Taste is features the fruit up front, more tart than sour (to they make pomegranate sweet tarts?), and the hibiscus dried out the finish.
