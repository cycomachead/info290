3.85,-9.2,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,4,"Verdict: A nice berliner from Bend Brewing, perhaps a bit too sour for my tastes, but the hibiscus is showcased well, decently balanced, but I'd like to see a bit more pomegranate in this. All in all, this is quite a refreshing and enjoyable beer, definitely would be a go to if I was local for summer sessions.","kevanb","Feb 22, 2015"

3,-29.2,3,3,3,3,3,"Pour is darker amber, lightly hazed, tons of bubbly white head that sits forever.  Nose is very little grain, heavy lacto, a bit of dusty brett, lots of lemon, a bit sugary.  Flavor is also too sweet, again virtually no grain, not as lacto/brett heavy, but becomes even sweeter lemon and candied sugar.  Body isn't super light, carb is pretty spot on, gets a little juicy.","cpetrone84","Dec 10, 2014"
4.16,-1.9,4,4.25,4.25,3.5,4.25,"this is excellent and real unique beer, i think the pomegranate comes through more in this neon pink colored berliner weisse than in any other beer made with the fruit i have had. the hibiscus is an accent flavor and aroma, rather than something perfumy and overbearing. the two actually go quite well together, and this beer is very sour. its got a puckery tart nose, lactic acid and lemon notes for sure, and then the fruit and flowers over the top of it. the sourness is really developed in the taste too, insanely tart in the finish especially. refreshing, but my one real critique of this thing is that it cant hold a head and that its carbonation is super light, it just doesnt feel like a berliner for that reason, ive said before, i really prefer my wild ales to be effervescent. not that its flat, but it just doesnt sing like it could and give life to the unique flavors. great fruit flavor though, and a really interesting finish. this is a beer unlike most others, and probably my favorite fruited berliner i can recall.","StonedTrippin","Dec 07, 2014"
