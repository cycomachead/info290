As someone who hates to see beer go to waste, I decided to finish it up for him.  Surprisingly, I actually liked this beer quite a bit.  Open the first taste, you get a bit of dry sourness but then it turns into a round, juicy flavor that I rather enjoyed.  I might need to rethink sour beers now.","iheartmyTHO","Mar 21, 2015"
