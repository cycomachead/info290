Aroma was pretty muted, light scents of soured grains and sweet corn. The taste was predominantly grainy, toasted wheat, light sweetness, some lemony tartness mid-palate, with a big grainy finish. Body was light, carbonation was low, mouthfeel was less lively than I prefer for a Berliner. Not bad overall, but nothing I'd go back for.","Rifugium","Jun 07, 2014"
