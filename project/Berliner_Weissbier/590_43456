4.18,0.2,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"The aroma is reminiscent of apples and fresh cut lemons. Pours a tantalizing straw color. Thick head retention, as per the foam that gushes out from the opening. This is a wonderfully balanced berliner weiss with an emphasis on a restrained tartness and refreshing citrus and apple tone. Some banana and sugar on the back end, with a yeasty undercurrent. A superb beer.","Barnoloid","Jan 03, 2015"
