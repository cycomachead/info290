This is a wonderfully balanced berliner weiss with an emphasis on a restrained tartness and refreshing citrus and apple tone. Some banana and sugar on the back end, with a yeasty undercurrent.

Aroma of wheaty funk as expected, some interesting clove and coriander spice, lemon peel, hay, barnyard. Flavor is a twinge of sour lemons on top of some cracked wheat and a bit of zesty spice. A very crisp finish and without the dirty wheat that I usually find unpleasant at the end of the sip for this style. Some definite white wine notes that were picked up even before reading on the label that reislings were used. Extremely light bodied and almost spritzy carbonation. Really more of a sour golden ale than a wheaty Berliner. Lucky for me, that is more to my tasting. Good stuff as usual from New Glarus. If we really want to call this a Berliner, I don't think there is anything close to this. Yum.","BMMillsy","Jul 03, 2014"

The aroma has a tart orange and raspberry character with hints of vanilla and cream. The flavor expands with grainy oak barrel touches that join the vanilla with sharp, acidic white grapes. This is a subtle, but crisp beer with an impressive depth of flavor and a wonderfully balanced sour tang to the light, bready sweetness. Find this beer.","tempest","Jun 20, 2014"

4.15,-0.5,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured into a proper NG pokal, a golden color with hardly any haze at all, topped with an unexpectedly long-lasting cap of bubbly white head; Champagne-like carbonation blipping up from the bottom of the glass. Aroma promised some tartness, notes of lemon and toasted wheat. The flavor reflected the nose, lemony with a nice tang to it, sour white grapes, toasted wheat, crackery malts, and some hay-like funk underneath. This is pretty much what berliners are all about! Body was light to light-medium, very easily drinkable, and smooth enough in the mouthfeel that even if you don't like sour beers I'd venture to say you'd be able to handle this one. Very nice overall, and a good example of the style.","Rifugium","Jan 12, 2014"

I think I get some coriander in there, but it might just be a figment of my imagination. The taste brings in more of the same, the sourness really shining through without becoming o'erwhelming. The body is a rather hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a damn solid Berliner, one that makes me wish we had easier access to New Glarus down here.

The aroma was a little on the mild side, with notes of lemon and wheat. On the initial taste, one gets bright lemon, lemon rind, biscuit, and some muted earthy tones. The beer finishes dry and sticks to the roof of the mouth in a manner that makes you want to scrape the taste off with your tongue. It reminds me a little of eating a granny smith apple. The carbonation was fairly intense, so the flavor does not last exceptionally long. Carbonation brushes away the lemony notes fairly quickly. The is not my favorite edition of the Unplugged series, but I would drink it again.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 09, 2013"

Kind of sulfuric at times, quite a bit of wet stone and mineral in there as well. The mineral aspect of this is not entirely pleasant, and it's a touch too sour for me.

It could be the temperature (pretty chilled), but there's not much in the smell - sour green apples, lemon, some wheat, a little musty. I was pleasantly surprised to find it tasted much more sour than it smelled. I can't decide if it's more of a lactic or acetic sourness, but the vinegary quality is subtle. Hops are imperceptable. The taste is dominated by sour fruit - reminds me of green apples and pear the most, but definitely some lemony citrus in there too. The beer ends with a subtle taste of wheat. Really dry - very similar to cider or champagne. medium-light bodied. I could definitely do more than one of these but the sourness prevents it from being a highly drinkable beer.

Sour white grapes, lemon peel, and Granny Smith apples all combine to pucker the back and sides of the mouth, but thankfully the acidity doesn't seem to wear out the palate. Give this one some time and allow its complexities to unfold across the palate--it will reward your patience. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, dry, and extremely carbonated, just as a good Weissbier should be.

Sour beers are quickly becoming some of my favorites.","KeefD","Sep 09, 2008"

Track it down before it's gone forever--New Glarus' Unplugged beers are brewed once with no promise they'll ever be brewed again. Too bad, as I'd love to see this one year round.","Metalmonk","Sep 06, 2008"
3.63,-12.9,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Pours a mildly hazey sunshine straw. Very light, yet bright white lacing that disappears rather quickly. Very light and small bubbling. Very clear Pinot Grigio and pilsner malt bill. The taste is a dry malt bill with some tart dry wine grapes and a touch of some of those sweeter Riesling grapes. The palate is a vibrant tartness with unripened green apple skins. This bee really envigorates the senses. Great wake up beer.","scruffwhor","Sep 06, 2008"
4.15,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a somewhat murky pale yellow hue with a chunky bubbled white head that quickly fades to a thin layer of bubbles. Some spotty lacing, but not a whole lot. Smell is light and fruity; grapes, apricots, and lemongrass. An interesting (but fitting) leather aroma finds its way in the nose as well. A unique aroma for sure, but one I enjoy. Taste begins very tart with white grapes and crisp sour apples. Sweet wheat with honey and sugar midway on the tongue. Aftertaste is very puckering with an acidic lemon flavor. Light and crisp body with a strong and lively carbonation. Very refreshing for this warm, out of season September night in Syracuse. I could see why some wouldn't enjoy this beer, but I love it. A perfect summer brew for sure. I wasn't a fan of Festina Peche which is the only other of the style that I've had, but this one is leaps and bounds above Dogfish Head's offering. A great beer experience for sure, glad I have a few more to enjoy.","BeerTruth","Sep 05, 2008"

Appears a slightly cloudy golden yellow color with a good three fingers of white foam that quickly dwindles down to about half an inch or so. Aroma is of citrus fruits and is a bit bready with some grapes thrown in for good measure. Taste is nicely tart with flavors of lemon, wheat, apple and grape. Very crisp and refreshing with moderate carbonation. Over the past two summers, this style has quickly become my favorite thirst quenching , go-to beer. Check it out if you have the chance.","ClockworkOrange","Sep 05, 2008"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very light golden hue with a thin head on top. This beer is lively, and the name "champagne of the north" is indeed quite fitting. An effervescent nose with apple, sourness, hild hoppiness, and grassy notes. Tastes pretty good. A nice rounded sourness to it with some hoppiness as well and with apple flavors predominant. A nice crisp and somewhat clinging feel that goes into a long seductive apple finish with the sourness becoming smoother. Nothing too special but a solid job by New Glarus and an enjoyable and quirky beer no doubt.","Duffman","Sep 01, 2008"

The flavors last pretty long on your palate - very refreshing and invites you back quickly for another sip.

Nice aroma of lime, grape juice, barrel funk and lemon rind. Starts with a definite tart presence, but it gets washed away rather quickly with a front of sweet lemon drops and grapes. The Reisling character appears throughout with a soft sweetness. But tart, crisp wheat character presides and is the main player. I'm no expert on this style, but this is pretty damn good.

This is by no means a big beer though, but I do wish a bit more wild complexity and funkiness came through rather than the grape flavors which are quite expressive. I must admit though that the flavors that the grapes contribute are quite nice, it is just I was expecting a reasonable facsimile of a Berliner Weiss given the name of this beer, and this has definitely moved in another, albeit derivative, direction. Still I'll happily consume & share my other bottles of this brew.","Gueuzedude","Jul 21, 2008"

I drank two bottles, but the tartness became cloying to me on the second bottle. I've had New Glarus' take on sour brown ale and was pleased, but I feel this one could use a little more than sourness to keep it interesting. Despite using two kinds of grapes, wheat malt, and 5 kinds of yeast (according to the label), it ultimately seems one-dimensional.","pweis909","Jul 21, 2008"
