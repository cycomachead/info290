Aroma of some strawberry and floral notes, wheaty berliner and yeasty sour notes. Flavor follows with lightly tart notes and strawberry, floral flavors, wheaty berliner finish is there but subdued. Light bodied and high carbonation. Though I’m not a huge fan of the style, this was pretty solid. I wouldn’t turn it down if offered again. Thanks for the share!","BMMillsy","Aug 03, 2014"

Thinking that cellaring this one for almost a year maybe wasn't the best idea, was probably a bit more balanced when the fruit was a little more potent. Having said that, very good take on the style.

The aroma is mostly strawberries with a lot of noticeable lactic sourness and a good amount of Brett mustiness. The flavor, on the other hand – look out. This thing is mouth-puckeringly sour. Strawberry and kiwi are prevalent with tons of sour acidity. At the finish, an earthy, floral taste comes out that may be the hibiscus and an earthy, musty, and funky flavor that has to be some Brett. The mouthfeel is tough to appreciate just because this thing is so sour but it’s light-medium-bodied with good carbonation. While this is too sour to fit into the Berliner weisse category, it is a delicious beer that is definitely worth a try if you can get ahold of it. Especially after seeing “brewery only” on the label, thank you so, so much for giving me a chance to try this beer, Jared! Cheers!","BlackBelt5112203","Sep 08, 2013"

Brew pours a majestic ruby with a nice fizzy head that fizzed away almost immediately leaving spotty lacing at best. Great pinkish orange color. Smell is soft soury egg with fruit. You definitely get the strawberry and kiwi with hints of floral notes. Subtle sourness. Flavor matches the nose with great fruitiness and just the right amount of eggy funk and floral, almost brett like sweetness. Super easy drinker and a.pleasure in this beautiful summer day.

Strawberry and kiwi are great fruits for such a concoction I think. Great job Night Shift.","Dope","Jun 02, 2013"

4.35,1.9,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Beer pours a beautiful reddish pink, almost like ruby red grapefruit juice. It pours with a fizzy, eggshell white head of big soapy bubbles that fades away slowly. The head leaves a very light lacing of thin sticky bubbles that form clouds on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body seems clean of particles, but hazy with no site of the other side of the glass. On the nose the beer smells like ripe and jammy strawberry. It is thick on the nose, and beautifully fruity, and though it is one dimensional with pure strawberry and maybe just a kiss of citric kiwi, it is still a big and beautiful smell that is rich and complicated in its own right. On the tongue the beer tastes tartly acidic and then fruity sweet with a lingering pucker but no traces of bitterness. In flavor the beer begins as puckering citric sour but then blossoms into huge strawberry flavors with touches of fuzzy sweet kiwi fruit and a very faint hint of savory hibiscus. The finish and aftertaste bring more of the subtle hibiscus flavors into the mouth alongside ripe strawberry skin and acidic kiwi fruit. The malt in this, of course, is light, but does give a faint touch of grainy breadiness. The aftertaste softly rings with lingering hibiscus and even fainter touches of strawberry. In the mouth, the beer feels sharply citric, but on the light side of medium in body. The real weight in the beer’s body comes from the real fruit that was added to the beer, and which (oddly enough) can be felt as a slight graininess on the tongue. The carbonation is sharp and prickly on the tongue, working to keep in order the massive, ripe, and sweet fruit flavors of the beer, and it achieves this nicely. The mouth is left puckering from the sourness of the beer, and also begging for more beer. Overall this is a beautiful example of the burgeoning American Weisse style. It is fruity, sour, and very refreshing while still being puckeringly refreshing. This beer tastes great. It is what all fruit beers should be with its beautiful fresh fruit flavors and its thirst quenching beer touches. Try this beer for sure.","Maxwell","May 16, 2013"

Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some berry and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity and acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and super easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 14, 2012"
