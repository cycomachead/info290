3.55,-12.1,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours an opaque, muddy straw producing 2+ fingers of effervescent, white, shortlived head that leaves no lace. Aroma is wheat, lactic acid sourness, green apple & lemon/lime with a hint of Brett mustiness. Taste is very lactic, thin wheat malt, some citrusy & green apple fruitiness, a little Brett & brine. Fruitiness & brine most prominent in the finish. Afrertaste is tart & salty. I'm not sure that this is brewed with salt as is the case with Gose but it certainly has a saline twang.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with medium carbonation, prickly, crisp, dry & puckering. If you liked Sweet Tarts candy as a child then you will most likely give this a solid 4-5.","mothmanscott","Feb 11, 2015"
