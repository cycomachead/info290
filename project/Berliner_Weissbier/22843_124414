4.17,0.5,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"D - Not the most complex beer, but enjoyable and easy to drink. Appreciate the sub-5% ABV too, as there are too many of these 6%+ Berliners popping up. Probably more appropriate for the summertime.","MasterSki","Jan 01, 2015"

3.49,-15.9,4,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Overall - Nice berliner.  The passionfruit aroma belied a much more intense beer that never materialized.","Alieniloquium","Dec 08, 2014"
3.86,-7,3.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A mild and interesting fruited sour beer.  Rough around the edges but a starter beer for those just getting into sours, as the casual drinker can easily pick out the fruit, handle the sour and begin to search out the funk and yeast involved.","rawfish","Dec 07, 2014"
