3.86,-1.8,3.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is slightly fizzy (1/5), then becoming somewhat foamy (1/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5). Generally fairly crisp and dry. Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips.","falloutsnow","Oct 06, 2013"
