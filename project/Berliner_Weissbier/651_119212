3.41,-3.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured a clear, golden hue with a small amount of white head (not to style as I understand, perhaps a bit more carbonation would be nice). Hint of lactic sourness on the nose, not much else. not a strong aroma. Lactic sourness on the palate right up front, some hints of white grape, and some bright lemon notes. Crisp and tangy. Effervescent with a nice, dry finish. Nice beer. One of my first Berliner-style beers. I am sure that there are some whoppers out there, but this was a nice taste of the style for a good price. Berliner-style might be making it to the homebrew queue.","Mikus","Dec 09, 2014"

4.02,14.2,,,,,,"Overall a good beer and one of their better new beers. Surprised ratings are so low on this one; a little simple but executed well and refreshing; would like to have it again. Reminds me slightly as a sour gose. Worth checking out.","mdfb79",
