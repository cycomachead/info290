4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Hazy yellow no head, saurkraut and bready aroma and flavor. Refreshing tartness and dry mouthfeel. "A" grade new world Berliner. Nothing too special.","Zach136","Mar 31, 2015"

Overall a splendid example of the style. Should go well if you prefer to add a dash of himbeer or waldmeister syrup.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 30, 2015"

3.76,-4.1,3.25,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"O- a bit of an underwhelming sour, especially at this rice point. One dimensional towards the tartness with only the mild breakfast cereal character giving any complexity. Could definitely stand some increased esters or funk. That said, it's an easy drinker and the six pack shouldn't last long as the days get warmer.","Guden","Mar 28, 2015"
