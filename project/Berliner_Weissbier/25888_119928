3.69,-4.2,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall - This just is not my style. I may have to try a more traditional Berliner Wiessbier to ensure it just wasn't this particular flavor, but this was too sour and funky for me. I rated it like I did because, according to the description, this is how these beers are supposed to be. Well, if that's the case, I don't like them, but I didn't want my personal view to cloud my reviewing judgement. Drink at your own risk.","TheCondor","Nov 22, 2014"
