4.4,18.6,3.25,4.5,4.75,3.75,4.25,"Not much to look at like most Berliner Weissbiers, not much head or lacing.  Nice smell, you get the citrus, more of a lemon with some funk.  Excellent flavor, similar to the smell, some citrus and very tart.  Very low on the ABV but this would be an unbelievable summer, hot weather beer that I enjoyed very much.","JamieDuncan","Nov 06, 2014"
