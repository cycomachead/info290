Big cherry flavors dominate the palate with lemon in the background and very faint grain flavors. It finishes tart and dry. It is a very refreshing, light and drinkable beer. Not syrup or cloying in anyway.","pat61","Feb 02, 2015"

This is a good take on a cherry forward Berliner from the fine people at Schell's. It doesn't quite match the lofty expectations of the original but it's still excellent and sitting even shouldered with the other two releases. Worth drinking without a doubt.","joe1510","Nov 07, 2014"

3.91,-6.5,3.25,4.75,3.5,3.75,4,"Overall: An exciting beer if you're at all into traditional beers and especially Berliners. Schell has gone to great lengths and you can taste it here. I would recommend chilling but then letting it warm up in the bottle for 15-20 minutes- I thought it was just ok (and very thin) when ice cold, but quite delicious as it warmed up. This is a great way to get those friends who love New Glarus Belgian Red to jump over into more authentic "sours", as the flavor profile here is much more traditional of a "sour" ale (although not as extreme as an American Wild Ale). I really wish it was $10-12 a bottle instead of $13-15. But I will most likely buy another to age until next summer.","robear","Oct 13, 2014"
