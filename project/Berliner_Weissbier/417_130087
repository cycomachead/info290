4.64,11,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Has a big cherry nose with a trace of tartness. It pours brilliant effervescent cherry red with a quickly dissipating 1‚Äù white foam cap. Big cherry flavors dominate the palate with lemon in the background and very faint grain flavors. It finishes tart and dry. It is a very refreshing, light and drinkable beer. Not syrup or cloying in anyway.","pat61","Jan 25, 2015"
