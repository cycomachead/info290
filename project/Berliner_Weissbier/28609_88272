The taste on this beer is weird - I feel like I'm drinking one of those spiced candle tart warmers.  Mouthfeel is light in body with an even carbonation and a slight astringency.

4.17,4,5,4.25,4,4.5,4,"Bottle. Like Ever Weisse by them, this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Pours a reddish purple. Body is clear. Almost the color of Pinot Noir. Blueberry juice color for sure. Soft, airy head that fizzles away quickly. The color is a pretty pinkish purple. The aroma brings forth some incoming tartness. Acidic scent. Tart fruit. Some wheat that reminds me of a blueberry pie or other blueberry pastry. Soft cinnamon, almost unnoticeable at first, when very cold. The bottle tells me to drink it at 45 degrees so I patiently wait for it to warm up and the aroma becomes more intense, slightly less sour and displays more cinnamon and wheat. The flavor is a big zap of tart berries. Not just a blueberry flavor; it's a unripe berry medley. It's very sour!  Acidity is very high, leaving my lips tasting sour as well. The cinnamon is soft at first but grows with warmth. Finishes with a pastry wheatiness that complements the berries. Not sure what batch this is but the label says 5.6% and was bottles on 12/22/14. Body is light and it's fairly dry. High carbonation. Lingering tartness. I thought this one was a great success. Their Weisse series has been great and more than makes up for a few duds along the road.","VelvetExtract","Jan 16, 2015"

While I enjoyed the first and second bottles, I found them to be almost tongue-bucklingly sour, with the potency of the sourness overshadowing the complexity of the beer's other flavors. With the extra bit of time on this particular bottle, however, some of that brash sourness has disappeared, allowing the other flavors in the beer to come out of hiding and have their turn in the spotlight. A tart, refreshing, and nuanced Berliner. Very nice, Night Shift, very nice indeed.","Ljudsignal","Dec 04, 2013"

3.82,-4.7,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Beautiful pink body. This beer looks like a peeled blueberry. I was very excited to get into this beer. All I got on the nose and from the taste was unripened blueberry tartness. This one was a little more acidic than I would expect from a fruited berliner. My favorite part of the taste was the finish of slightly sweetened cinnamon on the very back end. I kept drinking just for that. It was so interesting. I was hoping for more blueberry and less lemony tartness in the taste personally.","PHBoiler","Oct 28, 2013"

3.75,-6.5,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a murky pinkish-yellow with a small white head that doesn’t last but does leave a nice ring of white bubbles around the glass. The head leaves a thin, stringy lacing around the glass. In body, the beer is opaque and cloudy. On the nose, this beer smells of tart lemon, green apple, and yogurt. There is a faint touch of blueberry, indiscriminate spice and wheat flakes. On the tongue, the beer tastes very tart and acidic with just a wisp of sweet fruitiness and not much else. As the beer warms, the harshness mellows slightly but this beer is not very balanced and leans too heavily on its sourness. Compared to other weisses that Night Shift offers, this beer is a little out of whack. In flavor the beer tastes sour apple, sour lemon, yogurt, and chalk. The faintest touch of blueberry can be sensed, but I honestly think that is because I know there is blueberry in the beer. No cinnamon can be sensed, but I do pick touches of indiscriminate, hot spice on the tongue. The finish is quick and muted with sour fruit and the aftertaste is of puckering lemon. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body. Carbonation is a little fiercer than a medium level, but the beer is puckering and fierce in mouthfeel, with a touch of slickness. The mouth is left full of saliva and puckering from the sour shock of this beer. Overall, I am disappointed with this beer. Night Shift has really impressed me in the past with their Sour Futures program and the fruited weisses that they can pump out; this beer however, is just too sour. The acid bulls over any other nuance that the beer might have and makes the beer harder to drink. Night Shift usually does an amazing job of bringing fresh fruit flavors into their beer but they missed the mark with this vintage. This isn't a horrible beer but its a little too unbalanced for me.","Maxwell","Oct 24, 2013"

4.5,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a blueish purple color with a pink head. The smell is lactic sour with a definite blueberry smell and hints of cinnamon. The flavor is very similar to the smell with the sourness coming through the most with hints of blueberry and just a touch of cinnamon. I was not sure how cinnamon was going to work in this sour but it integrated really well with the blueberries. The mouthfeel is lite dry very well carbonated. Overall this is a great beer, and while not a traditional take on the style I am beginning to enjoy the fruited Berliners more and more. Just saves the time of adding syrup.","rowingbrewer","0"
