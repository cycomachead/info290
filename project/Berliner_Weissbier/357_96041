4.25,3.4,,,,,,"Fairly hazy, very pale yellow - practically white - in color. Forms a fizzy white head that slowly reduces to a creamy surface coating. Minimal lacing. Aroma is standard for the style: slightly tart, wheat, and a light bit of lemon. Taste is also pretty much on the mark for a Berliner. Mostly wheat with a slight lemony tartness. Lighter bodied. Heavier carbonation. Good stuff.","Florida9","Aug 27, 2014"

4.13,0.5,,,,,," The taste really is great with tangy yet not extremely tart flavors with subtle lemony tinge and nice foundation of wheat malt for a lactic acidity  which brings you back with light sweet cereral flavor and honey/lemon quality. Overall a pretty great canned berliner -probably the only I have had _ I would drink this anytime it is sour enough to be truly drinkable without crossing the trheshold of to tart -the epitome of what the style should be.

Of course not. But as a purpose built lawn mower beer, outta this world. I did a Berliner Weiss beer bakeoff betwee this and NG BW, and this was narrowly the winner. I had 2 cans. Now they are gone.

4.05,-1.5,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"O- This was a nice simple, standard berliner weiss. I'd love to see NEBCO put some fruit in this at some point, it might also be interesting to try again with some fruited syrup added. Overall it's nothing that I would go crazy for but if you are into the style then and don't mind a little acidity it is definitely worth the try.","jaasen64","Dec 17, 2013"
3.9,-5.1,3.5,4,4.25,2.75,3.75,"The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN and the inverted Glug released a sour, cheesy odor into the air. I had a brief finger of bone-white head that fizzed its way out of existence very quickly, almost like pop. Color was a cloudy, light-yellow (SRM = 2) and the serving wench in her drindl wanted to know "Mit Schuss?" "Nein, fraulein," I replied, "Schuss ist scheiss!" I like my beer unadorned. Nose had a sharp lemony tartness and my mouth puckered at the thought of what was to come. Mouthfeel was sort of thin, not watery, but not much to the body, either. The taste was tart, not sour, with a definite lemon-like flavor as part of the assault. Finish was a big "Wow!" as the tartness just seemed to explode in the back of my throat. It was definitely refreshing and would be much better on a hot, humid day in the summer. Still, it was very cleansing for my palate and left me ready to Crack open a CAN of something else.","woodychandler","Dec 16, 2013"

4.01,-2.4,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"12oz can bought at the brewery. Pours a very pale translucent straw color with a small head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Almost looks like a carbonated glass of white wine. Smells funky and sour with lemon and wheat aromas. The taste is a big sour punch of lemon up front, with some sweetness as well. Almost like a sour candy. Some wheat flavor followed by more sour lemon at the finish. Extremely refreshing and insanely drinkable. Virtually no alcohol presence. The can, the low abv, and the drinkability make this an ideal summer beer. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. Every sip is just a refreshing burst of sour lemon and wheat. I was hesitant to get a 4 pack at the brewery because this isn't a style I drink often but I took a chance anyways and I'm glad I did. Fantastic brew that I hope gets made again, but if not I'm glad I bought some.","PicoPapa","Jul 10, 2013"
