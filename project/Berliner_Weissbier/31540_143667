The balance is nice, though quite sour and with a more aggressive texture but the bright flavors and supremely refreshing nature of this make it another winner.","kevanb","Mar 16, 2015"

The raspberry are very pithy, seems very sour and tart.  Flavor is a bit less seedy, more cherry with a balanced raspberry.  a lot less tart than I would have thought but still has a hint of sourness.  Moderate carb, very dry, light body.","cpetrone84","Nov 25, 2014"

The nose is predominantly fresh picked raspberry paired with lactobacillus.  The cherry doesn't seem to make much noise here, perhaps it adds to the acidic undercurrent. The flavor is straight raspberry and lacto tartness.  Juicy fruits up front, nice puckering tartness to follow! a touch of grainy wheat on the finish. The barrel isn't detectable on my palate but that does not detract from how tasty this beer is! Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light. Overall, a delicious fruited berliner!","homebrew311","Nov 16, 2014"
