3.84,5.2,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Pale straw color, lots of bubbles and a massive white head.  A little barnyard funk, cut grass and a hint of peach on the nose.  Nice, mouth-puckering tartness, slight creaminess and, again, just a touch of peach in the flavor.  Not my favorite Berliner Weisse, but not bad.  This one's pretty easy to find and still scratches that itch.","thebeers","Mar 12, 2015"
