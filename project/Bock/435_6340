The aggro Glug got a fine cascading action going and I was CANtent to sit back and watch the show. This was actually starting to look like it might be drinkable! I had close to three fingers of dense, deep-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Did somebody make a mistake and make an actual beer at that swill factory? Nose was rich with caramel and chocolate malts and although I am not into sweet beers, there was no way that I was going to dun them for it. Mouthfeel was medium-to full and the taste was milk chocolaty, very tasty, almost like a chocolate milkshake. Finish was likewise quite sweet, reducing its drinkability for me, but a minor point. This disappoints me in the same way that the beers that come out of the Sandlot at Coors Field disappoint me - if you are capable of making something decent, then why do you waste your time brewing rubbish?

The smell of the beer has a lager-like aroma mixed with some caramel malt aromas. The taste of the beer is decent but nothing exciting. The caramel notes in the flavor are dominated by the lager yeast spiciness. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side on this beer. Overall this beer needs more malt, it needs to be sweeter and needs a stronger bitterness in the finish.

There is a good bit of malt vinegar in the aroma and some dark roasted malt, with very light coffee and cocoa. The aroma actually reminds me quite a bit of some Scottish ales.

I couldn't believe something this tasty could be so inexpensive. I felt I had stummbled upon something that the rest of the world didn't know about. While everyone else around me was gulping down Bud and Miller products, I was savoring this caramel colored, sweet brew made about 75 miles away from my town and I seemed to be the only one who knew about it. Then I began telling others about and they soon became converts. One day I asked one of these converts if they were still drinkling Huber Bock. He replied that he stopped buying it because it tore up his stomach. It wasn't long after that that I too began running to the bathroom after just drinking a few sips from one bottle. Then, one weekend I must of drank about 12 bottles and became deathly ill. I even began pissing blood.I had never gotten so sick off of beer before and I tried returning the remaining bottles to the store where I purchased them. I told the manager what had happened and he said I was the first person that he knew of that had tried to return beer. In conclusion, I would say to you that if you decide to drink Huber Bock, make sure there is a bathroom nearby with several rolls of t.p.","ishcabibble","Aug 28, 2008"

Also, since it was a little on the weaker side for a boch I thought it was a very drinkable beer. All in all, it's not bad for a mass produced boch beer, especially if your looking for a break from the super hoppy IPA's you've been drinking. It's definitely worth giving a try if you like this style- and can't to wait until the truly great Bochs get released.

Color is a brilliant/clear red-burgundy. Nose is malty sweet and phenolic, with notes of honey and plum. Not truly one dimensional, a little more hop presence in here colud work wonders for it! Bittersweet on first sip, with the fruity and honey notes from the nose playing their cameo parts, along with some fresh apple notes working their way into the nasal passage. Smooth, easy-drinking and malt-driven, although a touch thin for the style. Roasty but not-quite-smokey malts, with a touch of oilyness, a nice bitterness, and a touch of brisk, cleansing carbonation on the tongue. Lighter body than I'd like for the style, but not lacking in flavor or style-specific characteristics. Some alcohol is present toward the end of the palate but rather than interfere it compliments the taste and drinkability. A longtime personal favorite of mine, and a very flavorful and drinkable beer at its retail price - per style it is by far a better value than many offerings from craftbreweries, microbreweries, and brewpubs. Normally the price of a brew doesn't affect my opinion of it, but with this one I've always been impressed that such a great-tasting bock could be so value-driven: woe betide the new owners should they ever get rid of this brew!","Chaz","Sep 14, 2006"

The colors are a fine brown with less viscocity than expected and a non-withstanding head retention. Aromas are lightly malty per style with a twinge of fermentation sourness and graininess. The flavors are Irish Red in nature and lacking the deep, complex, tostedness, barley malt flavors. The alcohols add nothing to the beer. The texture is weak and tacky to the mouth.
