Nice aroma of sweet caramel malt, dark fruit, a little earthy oxidation. Flavor starts with caramel, slightly toaste malt, dark fresh and dried friut, tapering off to a drier brown bread and toasty malt finish with a light hop bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Aroma and flavor are classic bock, but the flavor drops off to a lighter, starker malt and hop finish that are not as well supported by by the richer caramel malt flavor of the start. This is a discontinued variety and this bottle may have some modest age to it, which may have affected the flavor. Still a nice, but unremarkable bock; pleasant but not in competition with the traditional ones. Still glad I got to try it before it goes archival.","LiquidAmber","May 20, 2014"

A dark reddish or coppery brown brew with an outstanding milkshake-thick tan head. Aroma is sublime and includes a gorgeous noble hop spice, assertive for the style, against a caramel and boozy raisin backdrop. Yes, I detect some booze on the nose, which is interesting. Not a super thick brew but semi-chewy with an oily mouthfeel, quite crisp and smooth. Tastes of caramel and brown bread with a hint of molasses, but the malts almost take a back seat to the spicy, earthy, herbal hops, with hints of licorice, green leaf, grape, and a noble floral perfume. Maybe more hopping than is typical for a bock but it works. Finishes rather dry, with a sour malt/toffee aftertaste and a mild alcohol burn. I have a soft spot for this brew, one of the first true craft beers I tried years ago. Playing a funeral dirge as I type this. Over The Hills and Far Away by Zeppelin.

There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Decent cling left behind as the head settles, too. Aromas of old world fruit sweetness, including dates, raisins, plum, and fig, on a bready, "thick" presence in the backbone. Flavors of rich, sweet character all over the tongue on a slightly watery, thin body. Roasty notes along all of the dark, earthy, and sweet flavors. This one is rich. Plum and fig again are present, with a touch of molasses bringing a dark and sugary touch to the sweetness. Very powerful on the sweet senses of the palate, and the body and backbone is unable to balance it out. Darkly sweet aftertaste, with a slick, lingering, cloying finish. This one has an overbearing flavor profile that makes it tough to drink en masse.","GarthDanielson","Sep 23, 2012"

Head is sort of sudsy with large and tiny bubbles that dissipate quickly and leave little to no discernable lacing. I took a strong whiff of this and got almost nothing out of it at first; it was served maybe a tad cold, but even with it warming, the smells were tough to pull out of this brew. I was able to get some caramel sugar and baked bread with some orange rind hops in the mix. The taste was quite malt forward; reminded me of slightly charred bread and almost no caramel sweetness. There was a bigger than expected hop profile as well; lots of citrus with a long, dry, bitter finish that lingers and lingers. Mouthfeel was clean, dry, and a little watery. Overall, I think the hops were maybe a little too big and took out the malt backbone. Not a bad beer, but just not something I would choose often.","estlinska","Jul 07, 2012"

Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of hops, hint of syrup, slight floral, and slight pale malt. Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an low-to-average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight hops, and a hint of syrup.

Some decent lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of light chocolate, biscuit, toasted malt, apricot, fig, raisin, caramel, molasses, and herbal hops. Nice aromas, with a good amount of balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, biscuit, raisin, fig, prune, molasses, toasted malt, and herbal hops. Nice balance of flavors with a decent amount of robustness; and no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slight creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming present at all on the finish. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable bock. Nice toasted flavors with good balance, and very smooth to drink.

Having tried a large number of Anchor offerings, I think it's close to criminal how their darker beers are so overshadowed by their more widely available flagship brews.

Even notes of spruce or mint seems to sneak in there. The body is medium along with carbonation. An easy drinker that goes down so smooth. I do notice that if you pick this up in the summer it loses that sparkle that makes it a top spring release.

Huge notes of caramel sugar and a touch of a woody and earthy like quality as well, really a very nice profile here, and classic for the style. The taste was fantastic. Very rich and creamy. I was surprised at how full the body was on this, with a really thick smooth like feel, not the usual crispness you would find, but this was superb. Nice carbonation really allowed the flavors to pop when you tasted it. Rich notes of caramel sugar and roasted malts just dominated the heck out of this one.

Nicely carbonated with hints of brown sugar and a nice balance of sweet malts, a bready slightly bitter finish. This is the type of beer I imagine they would drink in Buffalo around the turn of the century. The type of thing you can have instead of lunch and then go back to working on the canal.

Most impressive is its appearance, with a darkness more commonly expected from a doppelbock. The smell is entirely too one-dimensional and even predictable, without being enticing. Flavors struggle to find purchase on the palate, but do present themselves cleanly overall. In the end it is a mediocre beer unmistakably brewed by Anchor, and it does pair well with sweet and roasted foods (such as roasted sweet potatoes).","beagle75","Mar 08, 2011"

The smell is of sweet toasty malts, some faint chocolate and dark bready malts. This beer smells pretty spot on for a bock beer, lots of sweet bready malts. The taste is big bready and sweet, but nicely balanced by a finishing bitterness, could be from the dark roasted malts, could be some hops. I am guessing the latter from Anchor. I am somewhat familiar with their beers, taste a lot like their basic dark beer, kinda a bit like the Christmas Ale minus all the accoutrements. Anyway, not a huge bock fan, more a huge Anchor fan and this beer does not disappoint. I especially like the back end hoppyness to give a little more bitterness and balance away from the sweet malt.

The nose is real malty with a hint of a bitter chocolate. The bitterness jumps out right away but it's not overpowering. Some soft leather and burnt tobacco sits on the back of the tongue while a gritty malt texture sticks to the top of the mouth.

I would still definitely recommend this beer, and buy it again for myself.","Pencible","Mar 29, 2010"

4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Anchor Bock pours a beautiful shade of nut brown, a dark mahogany highlighted with maroon and mocha. The head is substantial and leaves good lacing. The aroma is sweet with some nuttiness, like a good, heavy pumpernickel or dark rye bread with a sprinkling of caramelized sugar. The malt is definitely the star. The beer really smells like bread; there's even a baker's yeast flavor lurking. The flavor is a bit sweet for my taste, but it's far from bad. It's an aggressively malty beer, more of a bread in a glass style beer than most American bocks. I don't recognize whatever hops were used, something European I'd guess. At any rate, the whole package fulfills my mental image of a Bock better than anything that I've previously tasted. While I'm not in love with the beer, I don't think that it could really be improved as my score might indicate. It's a tightly crafted beer that nails the style. Changing anything about it would be akin to making an entirely new beer because it tastes like they hit what they were shooting for already. Every time I have an Anchor beer, I ask myself why don't I buy from my local brewery more often. Anchor makes fine beer.","popery","Jun 04, 2009"

A sweet tasting beer that is thick and a littly syrupy as there are all kinds of malts in here. Caramel, bitter chocolate, maple syrup, molasses that combine with some roasted and/or coffee notes to give it a balanced dryness and some depth.

It's like a "dubbel/bock" hybrid. Flavor starts with the molasses/fudge combination. Anise oil dries it out a little. This is really a uniquely flavored bock. Now I'm thinking "Bock/dubbel/imperial stout" hybrid. There's some dry cedar and white birch coming through lightly. Caramel and bready malts. Medium full body.

As tantalizing as it looked the smell made me want it more. Floral hops, roasted to almost perfect sweetness filled the air in the glass. At the forefront you get a nice toasted hop with oak mellowing to sweet malts at the end. This is a full bodied drink, it's thick and creamy that goes down smooth.

I had never seen this particular Anchor Steam beer before so I definitely wanted to get it. Poured into my stange glass. This beer is a very dark brown color with some ruby/amber highlights. The big, fluffy tan head is about 3 1/2 fingers thick when poured, settling to a nice surface coating after about 15 minutes. Very excellent lace indeed. Sweet, strong malty aromas with chocolate, caramel and dark fruit-raisins and plums, and alcohol. Kind of surprised I could smell the alcohol this much since the beer is only 5.5% ABV. Sweet and malty with the aforementioned caramel, chocolate and dark fruits making their presence well known. A bit of a tart flavor and the taste of alcohol round it out. Has a mild hop bitter finish. Has a crisp, frothy and smooth, sort of chewy full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink indeed! One of the best bock's I have ever had. Period! This was fantastic!","neenerzig","May 08, 2008"

A somewhat unusual blend of sweetness and sour with some hop bitterness at the front. Pretty drinkable, not heavy, but I don't think I would want too much of this level of tartness.

It is very malty but the additional hop, roasted nuttiness, and most importantly the sweet fruitiness that knocks this one out of the park.The feel is between medium and full with a slight sticky feel to it.

The aroma caught me off guard at first - I thought I smelled suede. It's more like a light roasty, chocolaty, nutty aroma. The flavor shows some roasted malt and faint hazelnut. It reminds me of sticking my nose in a one pound bag of cracked dark crystal malt. There is definitely some Anchor Porter character here in the nose and taste. A little fuller than medium bodied with a little extra carbonation. Finished slightly tannic from the burly darker malts that colored this otherwise lower gravity beer. Also some hop bitterness. All in all I don't know if this really tastes like a bock, but it tastes good. Call it Anchor Porter Light. Wait! Two thirds of the way into this beer and I suddenly had a revelation.

A very rich mouthfeel, I was expecting something a little more lighter, not that there is anything wrong with that, it slides it way across the palate for a very clean finish.

Slight lingering alcohol aftertaste, with a sticky, dry finish. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic but crisp yet deep.

Some roasted malt, a bit of burnt coffee, a lot of sweetness. Maybe a touch watery. There is a slightly drying characteristic to this beer in the mouthfeel. Carbonation is right on the money, balances nicely with a decent FG, though I think this could've been a bit higher.","benmiliron","Apr 29, 2007"

The nose highlights caramel, burnt sugar, molasses, and dark fruit. I would imagine that I am missing a bunch, but what I am picking up is very enticing. The taste highlights, while are similar to the aroma just come out more and add so much to the experience. The caramel, molasses, brown/burnt sugar flavors come out intermingling in a fantastic brew. At the tail end a hop flavor is there giving a slight but perfect amount of bitterness while a chocolate flavor seems to come and go quickly. I was actually not expecting all of these flavors to come out, this brew really impresses me and I cant believe that this is my first exposure to it. The feel is quite dry, an excellent brew all around.","Stimack","Apr 14, 2007"

Mouthfeel is so smooth but has a bit of a tingle to it. Carbonation seems to be there quite a bit throughout, but doesn't distract from this amazing bock.

Aroma is an American twist in hops on a German style base...the hops are piney and citric but sweet malts are detectable, inviting and very 'anchor.' Taste is on par stylistically and again a distinctly anchor beer, which I'd say is not unlikely due to the yeast. It's delicious, but the alcohol is detectable, very rose like. Wheat is present but not overwhelming, and the hops are light but just enough for me while not at all bordering on a sugar bomb. Mouthfeel is full! Smooth carbonation again characteristic of anchor.

There isn't any espresso or cocoa here, so this goes down a lot easier than any stout or porter would. This is another great offering from one of my favorite breweries, and a shame that this is the only solidly crafted Bock that I've ever had.

On the palate, the nose is reprised, albeit with the addition of a touch of brown fruit and a slight, highly complementary alcohol burn. Very smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation -- that is, enough to tickle the tongue a bit and keep things fresh, but not enough to fill the mouth and create the sensation of greater weight/volume. Overall, this is a wonderful bock. It's not over the top -- just moderate weight, ABV, and hefty-but-nuanced flavors.","geexploitation","Mar 27, 2007"

It was colder than it should have been, lacked head retention (probably a dirty glass), and without releasing some of it's carbonation, 'twas a bit gassy and harsh on the tongue. The caramel flavor was reduced, or perhaps I should say concentrated, as its full breadth of character was masked by the cold. Once warmed a bit it's wonderful.

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer exhibits much of what I like about Anchor's beers. They are always very flavorful and extremely clean. A lot to brag about, and very drinkable. Looks very clear with a tan, loosely knit head retention. A strong toasty malt character shows boldly in the nose and flavors. Hop aromas shadow the malts closely and nearly compete with the grains. Simple, without a lot of muddled flavors; roasted coffee and chocolate with a whisp of a finish. Hop flavor takes on grassy and pine notes and ride well into the finish. The body is lighter than the flavors would make you think, but again, this leads to good drikability. The hops kick the beer out of syle a bit, but then that would not be the Anchor Steam way; but adds to the crispness of the brew. The grains, however, do take on chalky and astringent proportions late, but does little to interfere with the favorable qualities of the beer.","BEERchitect","Mar 15, 2007"

Therefore, the strength of the coffee even today seems to dissipate as one travels west through the country. My point being that it appears the bock style here has tranformed accordingly en route westward to San Francisco, taking on some of the west coast philosophies in lieu of the typical German bock profile.","mjsarch","Feb 02, 2007"

I smell malty blankets of yeast and barn yard with a bunch of intermingling bitterness and roasted malts. Great balance. The taste is just as unique. Very malty and roasty, but not high in the fruity malts that I'm used to in most bocks. A little dry roasted mlats with a few hints of dried prunes and apricots.

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at Anchor Brewing during a recent tour. Great overall taste on this one, great beer! Its a newer beer for them, and they have hit the nail on the head with this one. Not as heavy or sweet as their barleywine, but just as enjoyable to drink. Recommended to anyone wanting a slightly thicker, more complex darker beer.","Solomon420","Jun 24, 2006"

3.8,4.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Anchor's dark beers have been appearing on my table at Christmas dinner for some years now. This one pours with thick, creamy foam, brownish in color. The color of the beer is reddish, dark brown. Smelling sweet, with hints of fruits and coffee. The taste is bitter with roasted hops and bubble-gum. It almost has a powder-like mouthfeel. It definately measures up to Anchor quality, although the tastes could be a bit more pronounced.","JanM","Jun 14, 2006"

4.09,12.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The look was kind of blah, but beginning at the aroma, it redeemed itself nicely, carrying a flavor that seems dependable and lip-smacking good. I had one, but had I not had kids in tow, I would gladly have had another, and it would have been every bit as good as the first. This is the kind of beer that makes bock season a joy...it's basic but fairly complex, and goes down smooth and mellow. That's a fine Springtime scenario.","Foxman","Jun 05, 2006"
4.35,19.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Never did see this on the east coast, nor had I really known about it, so I had to grab a bottle of this upon finding it in CA. Crimson brown with a well held tan head. Spicy nose hints at plums and licorice. Flavor is really toasty with very nice complexity; subtle coffee, plums, an enormous chewy malt profile and a fair smattering of hops on the palate make this one interesting brew. Kind of reminds me of their OSA without the pine/spruce element, but still has a flavor profile all its own. Extremely drinkable at 5.5% as well. I'd be happy drinking stein after giant stein of this one.","IrishRedRock","Jun 03, 2006"

4.35,19.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a very deep brown color with impressive reddish notes. Smell is loaded with malt infused with a nice dark fruitiness (raisins, figs, dates, prunes). taste is fruity sweet with the prune and dates really showing through. Finish is initially very sweet but a pleasant hoppy bitterness begins to assert itself. A very nice creamy mouthfeel is the perfect ending for this beer. Great drinkability. Really a winner.","tgbljb","May 16, 2006"
4.22,15.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Upon the beers disemboguing the 12-ounce stubby bottle a deep chocolate brown with a massive creamy dark tan head that ever so slowly erodes leaving a thick blanket of lace upon the glass. Nose has a molasses like sweetness, big malt aroma, hints of hops and a bit of chocolate to this old schnozzle, start is somewhat sweet with a good grain presence, the top moderate in feel. Finish is lightly acidic, the hops pleasant in the spiciness, very dry aftertaste, a throwback to the old Bocks like Pabst.","Gusler","May 13, 2006"
3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a rich, dark mahogany color with a frothy and sticky 2" head. Aroma is roasted malts, with chocolate and toasted bread notes. Taste is sweet maltiness up front, with a mild alcohol kick mid-sip, and an ever so slight hop bitterness. This beer finishes VERY indeed, nothing lingering afterwards....very nice! Not a huge fan of this style, but this is one beer that will have me trying a few others.","jockstrappy","May 11, 2006"

4.07,11.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Dark coffee color, with red hues as you can see through it in the light, revealing nice clarity. The slim head doesn't last long at all, and leaves a very faint ring in its wake. Aroma of tangy brown malt, sweet with licorice, nut, and brown sugar notes. Flavor is of clean, nutty sweet malt, slightly tangy in the finish. There is a slight roasted character present and perhaps a hint of cherries. Mouthfeel is decent, medium thick, adequate carbonation. This is fairly mild, with solid, clean flavors for a darker beer, making it an excellent choice for a session ale. Another fine offering from Anchor...","bennetj17","Apr 09, 2006"
3.87,6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear, deep chestnut with ruby highlights. The light brown head left behind some clumpy lacing. Rich, malty sweet aroma with caramel and a bit of chocolate character, also mild alcohol and a hint of hops. There's a hint of roast that adds to these qualities in the flavour, along with a bit of toffee and apple core. Light lingering bitterness and malt. The body was a little lighter than expected, but certainly not approaching thin. Fairly dry with low carbonation. One that I'd definitely give another try. Thanks HogTownHarry!","DrJay","Mar 25, 2006"

4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Like Wetcoaster I was surprise to see this offered at my local Whole Foods Market, didnt know Anchor made a Bock. My only previous experience with the style was the in my opinion, vastly overrated Celebrator, still I decided to try it. Deep copper color was topped by a tan head that displayed excellent retention. Lacing was in nice sheets, lots of it. Aroma was sweet malt and a bit of burnt or roasted notes. Smooth taste profile, malty, subtle hopping and a slight roasted tone. Medium thick mouthfeel, and a very drinkable dark beer. Not bad and I think I'll have it again.","Mark","Jul 30, 2005"

3.44,-5.8,4,5,2.5,4,3,"Bottle provided by wezil, ala BIF20. Thanks for the opportunity! Freshness date is 5YM and consumed in July 2005. Pours a half finger walnut brown head over a very dark brown liquid. The edges are cloudy dark ruby red when head to a bright light. Smells richly of sweet caramel and toffee. Some chocolate and a gentle hint of alcohol. Tastes chocolatey with a rough grassy hop edge. I do get some citrusy hop character, but can't identify the type specifically. Hop bitter is quite strong and the aftertaste is rough grassy. Not what I was expecting from a bock...I anticipated a caramally sweet beer. Caramel is only found with searching and actually comes across as toffee. As the beer has warmed I get some roast flavor during the draw and before the swallow that I think contributes to what I was perceiving as hop bitter. To style, I'd place this as a sweet stout. Medium mouthfeel (and slightly creamy) and moderately carbonated.","mentor","Jul 17, 2005"
4.5,23.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a bit too aggressively into a standard beer mug -- the head is Godzilla-like, ruddy tan in color with excellent retention. The body is rich brownish crimson with maroon highlights when held to the light. Smell: Molasses, orange zest, green apple peel, sourdough -- full and complexly layered. Taste: Citrus zest bitterness upfront, followed by a sprinkle cocoa quickly eclipsed by a stronger hop presence (crusty, delicious); a nice grain profile unfolds, thick; some grape and apple sweetness dances in the background. Aftertaste is a well paced stretch of bitterness over top the still lingering puddles of bright sweetness. Mouthfeel: Perfectly round, a little chewy, middling carbonation. Pretty damn good.","RootedFool","Jul 15, 2005"
3.4,-6.8,4,4,3,3,3.5,"It pours an incredibly dark ruby brown; so dark it appears black when not held to the light. A 3 finger lighttan head sits atop, falling to a finger over top. The nose is pretty nice. I get a blast of piney and spicey hop over a chunky malt backbone of roasted nutty notes. The flavor is a let down. I get an initial bitter when I first sip. It moves to a light roasted to slightly burnt character, but overall, the flavor is light. The feel is light as well. I would like to see a bit more body here. Its not a hard to drink brew, but the lack of flavor just misses for me. Just okay on this one.","kmpitz2","Jul 09, 2005"
3.38,-7.4,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Pours a dark color with a tall head that has decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass.

3.85,5.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Fruity aromatic notes of raisins and figs waft from my glass as I pour this beer. Pours a deep, dark, amber color that shows ruby notes when held up to the light. As well as the fruitiness I get notes of chocolate, a hint of lightly spicy hops, toasted malt. This is really quite interesting in the nose, it is richly malty. The taste is ever so lightly sweet, it is richly malty compared to the sweetness, which is quite nice. The beer has notes of chocolate, toasted malt, and dark caramel. This beer finishes quite dry, with a lightly astringent note of toasted malt that tends to linger a bit. This note makes you thirsty and ready for another sip. This beer has a fairly light body to it, at least for a bock, it does have a decent amount of mouthcoating maltiness to it though. There is a bit of spiciness to this beer that I would attribute to hops, other than this the beer is pretty low on the hopping scale; there is just enough to make sure the malt is not cloying. This is really quite nice, and is almost a quaffing bock, by which I mean a 22oz bottle is just about the right amount.","Gueuzedude","Jun 30, 2005"
