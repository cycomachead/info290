I love to eat chocolate but drinking it in a beer I find myself enjoying only in rare cases. Other than the chocolate, there is some hop bitterness,but not much, in the finish and some roasted malt flavor in the middle of the taste.","Foyle","Apr 27, 2014"

I do not pick up on the malt profile, but perhaps is masked by the loads of chocolate flavors. Way to sweet for my buds. Has some attempts of a spicey hoppiness to balance things out but way overpowered by the chocolate. Highly carbonated and a tad thin compared to Bock's I've had in the past. Could use more of a hoppy backbone to balance things out. Definitely a dessert brew. I nice one to try, but I wont go out of my way to seek it out again.","wiscokid920","Feb 12, 2013"

Flavor is sweet chocolate, similar to cocoa, and lighter toasted malt and vanilla. Finishes with cocoa and a hint of hops. The cocoa flavor lingers for quite a while.

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense dark khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, cream, vanilla, roasted malt, light pear, toast, light nuttiness, and light herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance of dark maltiness and chocolate flavors. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, vanilla, cream, roasted malt, dark bread, light pear, light nuttiness, and light herbal hops. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toffee, caramel, vanilla, toast, roasted malt, light nuttiness, dark bread, and light herbal on the finish for a bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of roasted chocolate flavors and other malts; with minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good; very thick feeling considering the ABV. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice flavored bock style! Very robust and nicely balanced malty roasted flavors with chocolate; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering. Definitely a dessert beer.","superspak","Jan 24, 2013"

3.5,-3.3,4,4,3.5,2,3.5,"This is a good example of the interesting factor. They definitely didn't go overboard on the chocolate, nor was the result a cloying dessert-like concoction. The chocolate actually gave it more of an exacerbated earthiness and smokiness that probably wasn't otherwise there, being a lager and presumably, not being amped up enough to be a doppelbock. So, the beer was rather nice. I still used it as a dessert because it was still sweet, but it didn't lose its ability to be a beer along the way. The stickiness of the mouthfeel was a bit much, especially for a bock, but whatever. So, it gets a poor mouthfeel rating. It still has some stuff going for it. My favourite part about it, oddly, was smelling it when I breathed out after drinking it. It's distinct from the aftertaste in the mouth, which is actually a bit unpleasant. It's like an after-aftertaste, that makes up for the poor aftertaste you just experienced. But still, a naturally earthy, chocolaty beer is generally better than this.","ElCommodoro","Nov 23, 2012"

I'm greated with dark fruits and caramel. Chocolate comes through but accompanied by strawberries, citrus slides its way through, with sweet malts finishing it out. I look forward to this beer every year and forgetting what it tasted like made it that much better this year.","Chris_Cali_2o9","Nov 22, 2012"

Aroma is more subtle than I expected, but there is definitely chocolate, along with dark malt character, and caramel. The taste is very good, sweet at first, dark chocolate right up front that fades to a coffee like mocha flavor. There is a balance to the sweetness in the bitter chocolate character of the darker malts. Low carbonation, full body, and a very nice creamy mouthfeel. This almost reminds me of drinking chocolate milk. Excellent beer overall, brings unique character to the style while not straying too far away.","scvance","Nov 14, 2012"

There's a thick, light tan head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There are some visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. I detect notes of faint chocolate with some of the malt. There's some sweetness in the aroma. The chocolate notes are much more prevalent in the taste than in the nose. The chocolate is rich and the roasted malt provides some good backbone to this beer. The body is light to medium with medium carbonation. The finish is smooth and clean. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Nov 12, 2012"

3.55,-1.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a snifter, this beers is a deep cola color, hints of dark red, with a one-finger tan head, which dissipates almost immediately. It looks fizzy and perhaps over-carbonated. Decent texture clings to the inside of the glass. Smell is OK...I am not getting much of anything too overpowering; mild chocolate, malt, and hop aromas that are every so slight. Taste is actually pretty good for a "chocolate ale" with the chocolate being rather lighter than bitter or less smooth. The chocolate in here is nice. There are some other artificial coffee and mocha flavors, as well as an artificial sweetness. Mouthfeel is my favorite element here. Smooth with the right amount of carbonation, leaves a nice after taste. Overall this beer is OK. I had it several years ago in a bomber and thought it was OK then, as well. Glad I tried it, prob won't go looking for this in quantity, but might be nice to have around for a taste at some point down the road. Cheers.","rodlavers","Nov 11, 2012"

This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good bock with a nice chocolate presence in the aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 09, 2012"

If this beer was truly brewed as a bock (which is typically a lager), it might benefit from a diacetyl rest to reduce the buttery component.","HamFon","Apr 14, 2012"

Nose is an ambiguous blend of mild chocolate and an indefinable something that isn't exactly pleasant. I wish I could describe it better, but there's a slightly industrial/artificial character to the nose that is off-putting. The taste is very one-dimensional; it basically tastes like Hershey's syrup in seltzer water, accompanied by an (un)healthy dose of straight sugar. There's a hint of bitterness and alcohol in the finish, but that's about the depth of the complexity as far as I can tell. The staying power of this beer is nearly nonexistant; each sip is more overbearing than the last, so much so that I'm having difficulty finding the will to finish the glass. The most noteworthy accomplishment here is that they've managed to make a chocolate beer very underwhelming to someone who's easily pleased by chocolate beers. I think a big part of the issue is that the chocolate is too sweet--more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate. That might work in a beer with a more complex flavor profile, but as the backbone of a beer with little else going on, it falls flat.","MaximalC","Apr 10, 2012"

Smell is of sweet chocolate, roasted barley, slight hint of licorice, and slight hint of prunes/raisins. Taste is sticky sweet -- a combination of fruit and chocolate. Almost reminds me of raisinets, or more accurately, a chocolate covered cherry. Not sure if I would have more than 2 of these in a sitting, but good beer if you just want one on a winter day or perhaps to pair it with a nice slice of german chocolate cake.","oldirtycaffrey","Jan 24, 2012"

I do admit a certain surprise at how relatively light the actual cocoa flavors were, given that the bottle advertises that the beer was aged "on a bed of rare dark cocoa nibs".

Mouth-feel is smooth and creamy with very strong flavors of milk and dark chocolate making this essentially the cold hot cocoa of beers. Also has notes of toasty malt that balance it all out and give it a more typical dark beer flavor. You can really taste the real cocoa it's brewed with, and to get a better idea of the flavor I'm talking about, try a bit of the baking cocoa next time you make brownies.

The aroma almost explodes out of the bottle from the second the cap is removed with the unmistakable scent of bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is likewise dense with chocolate, with a rich chocolate cake characteristic up front. This chocolate bomb wears on the palate after a while, though, and an earthy bitterness that doesn't entirely mesh with the chocolate notes creeps in. The texture is smooth, creamy, but also quite clean, creating a strange and interesting contrast to the rich flavor. Overall, this may be the most chocolate-flavored beer I've had, but the novelty wears off after a while, and what's left isn't particularly robust. Definitely interesting, though, and worth the try.","devilben02","Feb 21, 2011"

Smell is of mellow chocolate and quite strong - pleasingly sweet. Very mild hop profile. Plenty of chocolate flavor on the tongue with some coffee notes jumping out. I enjoyed the first several sips but the effect wore off fairly quickly - I can see how this one might get old if having more than one or two as it's sweet, yet doesn't have much in the way of other dimensions. Some noted it's tough to find the typical bock/lager flavors and I agree it's not very pronounced. Quite a bit of chocolate!","HoppyMcStout","Dec 30, 2010"

While not offensive, I wish it was toned down a bit. Would have liked to have had more of a dark baker's cocoa bitterness. Mouthfeel was also too sweet for me. Drinkability was just average.

Tastes almost sickeningly cloying on the chocolate part, this is definatly not chocolate roasted malts here but more so a fake chocolate extract, this is why im amazed at how many other BA's actually refer to this taste as chocolate malts. Halfway through the 12oz serving its really hard not to get sick from this brew, shes tough to get in and one is definaly way too much. Overall I really liked the 2008 SA Chocolate Bock, but this beer is no doubt a different recipe and falls very short of what I was expecting this year, I guess thats why I can get a 24pk of SA Winter Classics @ $19.99 that includes 4 of these beers, vs. paying $11.99 for a 22oz bomber of the 08 recipe.

The taste has a more pronounced burnt chocolate feel than one would expect following the aroma. There are some thin hops way back behind everything else.

In the beginning of the taste I get a strong roasted malt presence followed by sweet chocolate. The chocolate is there but not overwhelming. For a beer with chocolate in the name its not too sweet, but sweet enough to enjoy a few of these beers.

Slight bit of dark fruit and a hint of minerals in the taste as well. Sweet chocolate chewy mouthfeel, oily mouthfeel and a moderate level of carbonation. I remember not being to fond of this when I overpaid for a bigger bottle, this reasonably priced bottle doesn't make it much better.

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a tight, two inch mocha-colored head composed of tiny compressed bubbles below the cap. Head eventually settles into a thin, quarter inch consistent cap with thick swaths of lacing coating the glass during the tasting. Nose smells a little bready with perhaps a trace of lactose and cocoa. Taste reveals cocoa, vanilla and brown sugar, with a slightly chalky quality that comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with an even carbonation and a slightly silky texture across the tongue. A nice brew.

Aromas of roasted malts and some chocolate but less than I expected. The taste is where you get the full chocolate effect. Has a nice flavor of cocoa and dark chocolate. Slight caramel aftertaste to it. Very rich. I know this beer used to come in somewhat expensive bigger bottles. The 12oz bottle seems to be the perfect size for this beer because I feel that if it were in a bomber it might be too much to drink at one time.

Aroma is great and hits you with complexity and rich chocolate. It goes down very easy and makes for a great winter after dinner brew. For some, they may find it a bit sweet.

Aroma does smell of chocolate but to me it smells like milk chocolate rather than the dark, sensual, bitter chocolate of the jungle. The flavor is very sweet and there is plenty of chocolate but it is not very interesting. Body is thin which could of benefitted by a lot more dark malt. The name says bock but the label on the neck says ale. So what is it? Sure glad I did not pay $15 for one of those bottles the last few years and got this in the Winter seasonal pack.

Aroma consists of well-balanced roasted malts, a very small amount of bittersweet chocolate and moderate caramel, and very lightly hopped. This one sips pretty easy, like a cola, especially for a 5.6% beer and no hotness of alcohol. I believe that this is actually a light-to-medium bodied beer, leaning toward light, but I haven't read any other reviews to see what the general consensus is. I would have expected medium-body. The caramel and roasted malts only stick around for a short while, and fade into a fairly clean palate. My girlfriend loves this beer, so I need to make sure she gets the rest of the chocolate bock in the Sam variety pack.

However, this beer's single selling point, its taste, outweighs these initial shortcomings by a ton. Very rich, dark malts are heavily laced with sweet and bitter chocolate notes from beginning to end. While not necessarily complex, nothing short of delicious, and in my humble opinion, should be sipped and enjoyed entirely on its own.

It pours a translucent dark garnet-brown topped by a short-lived half-finger of pale ecru foam. The nose comprises chocolate (I know, I'm shocked, too), cocoa powder, light coffee, molasses, light roasted malts, and brown sugar. I think a vein of maple syrup and caramel runs through there as well. The taste is very similar, with the chocolate really taking control of things. A slight cola flavor finds its way into the mix, but remains coy and aloof in the background, so as not to interfere with the chocolate's affairs. The body is a svelte medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a silky feel. Overall, this is a tame version of the former glory, but very good nonetheless. The only major knock against it is that it's a tad fizzy for my liking, as well as feeling a bit light. Beyond that, though, I'm glad I can get my fill of cheap Chocolate Bock this Winter!","TMoney2591","Nov 08, 2010"

Not too much going on with the hops but enough to balance the sweetness of the malt. I am no stranger to chocolate beer, in fact, Rogue Chocolate Stout is one of my favorite brews. This beer is somewhat similar but more malty than bittersweet or hoppy like that brew. Not nearly as much depth of flavor, but to be fair I am comparing a Bock (in the lager family) to a full blown ale stout. Also, there is no residual chocolate floating around in this filtered beer which is a mild disappointment in the mouthfeel department (yes, I want to drink my dessert in the form of beer).

Taste is ok, big cocoa notes, some bitterness in line with some darker chocolate flavors, and some toasted malt. Something in it doesn't jive with me, however... almost a chalky or flat taste to the chocolate. MF is medium--this would benefit from a bit more body and a bit less carbonation.

This beer, the Chocolate Bock, looks awesome, it's ominous, and intriguing. Even up to the point that you our it into a glass of some sort, this beverage looks amazing. But it was the taste that threw me off. I got an essence of chocolate no doubt, but there was layers of thick flavor that could have done without.

Really more of a cocoa or nestle' quick type mix, it's really not very strong. I enjoyed the taste. Again, not quite as chocolaty as I expected, but there was a chocolate taste that was present throughout. There is a coco taste present but also some bitter chocolate for the aftertaste. Also some roasted malt taste very present. I find that in many bock style beers the alcohol taste can be strong, but not in this one. I found the mouthfeel to be very good on this, it's better as it warms up, but not bad cold either. I find it very light bodied which is rare for any chocolate style beer that I've ever tried. There was absolutely no carbonation or alcohol bite to this at all. I also found this beer incredibly drinkable cold and when it warms up a bit.

I thought the body was sufficiently smooth, nice texture, a lit thin in the body. Smell and taste were best soon after opening, air did not seem to develop much beyond that. Still, I thought that the first half of this beer was delightful with hot chocolate notes, cocoa beans, well balanced and not too sweet.

The beer gets more chocolatey as it settles, but there is not an overpowering, or very distinct chocolate flavor to the beer.

Some light grassy hops towards the end to keep the brew honest. I don't really pick up much bock flavors, seems to be like a chocolate version of their honey porter, though not as roasty/heavy. Actually as the brew warms the chocolate flavors seem to fade and the vinous bock flavor comes into play.

The head lingers and provides a nice aroma for the entire length of the drinking experience. The smell was somewhat chocolatey, but had the backbone of a lot of different malts, some honey and a lot of caramel. The taste was more interesting than the smell, but I appreciate them both. There was a nice bock base that was easy to pick up on while experiencing the cocoa. This is a malt-bomb and is a very complex in the way the malts play off each other, making it fun to drink. The mouthfeel was a little slick, but the carbonatino was just right, which also helped out the drinkability. I wish I could afford to get this regularly, and I might pick up another bottle.

The chocolate is just not complex enough to garner a higher score. The same problems exist on the palette, but they're even more pronounced. It tastes more like cocoa than chocolate. It's just not really my thing, but I can understand how someone could enjoy it. The feel is thin, a bit watery and works against the chocolate. It just tastes more like cocoa water than anything else. It just really lacks complexity. I'm fairly shocked that Boston Beer is selling this beer for so much money. It's a great bottle, but there are better chocolate beers for a third of the price. I know it's a bock and maybe some folks like that, but it's nature as a bock takes a big backseat with this beer.

3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"750mL bottle, Enjoy before April 2009. Pours a very deep ruby with a one finger beige head, fair retention. Up front in the aroma are loads of sweet caramel and toasty malts, brown sugar, some lager yeast, and a little cocoa--not as much as I was expecting. Flavor, however, is all about the chocolate--cocoa powder with some sweet vanilla dominate the caramel and toasty malts, which take a back seat. Dry finish with minimal carbonation, and just a tinge of roasty malts. This never got too sweet (3-3.5 out of 10), though it may have been balanced by the roast I hadn't noticed before. Smooth medium body with light prickly carbonation. I can't agree with the $15 price tag, but it was definitely worth a try, though I probably won't be buying another. 4-7-8-4-15","iowaherkeye","Nov 23, 2008"

For this being a chocolate beer I was expecting it to be motor oil black, but I was very surprised it was quite clear. The smell was a nice roasted blend of cocoa, dark chocolate and a bit of carmel sweetness. Taste was just like the smell heavy on the chocolate and cocoa flavoring, nice afertaste of roasted chocolate. Overall for the price I was expecting a bit more, the look of the bottle and also expensive chocolate probably drove the price up.

3.34,-7.7,3,4,3.5,3,2.5,"I am reviewing a bottle of Sam Adam Chocolate Bock that has been cellared. The bottle says "For Brewery fresh taste enjoy before March 2005." I was given this bottle by a friend and I have never had it fresh so I cannot tell how it compares. I can say that it has aged well. Considering it is only 5.6 %ABV, it has made it to this point in good shape. Very little oxidation in the flavor. In fact, the flavors in this beer have seemed to tighten up and smooth out well. Some distinct port/sherry flavors which I am sure is partly based on the style of bock, and partly based on age. Pours a deep brown with garnet hues when held to the light. Aroma is port wine, raisin, and prune. I get some chocolate in the aroma but not overwhelmingly so. Flavor wise, I definitely taste chocolate. I understand this comes from chocolate nibs added to the beer. I am not sure if I really like this type of flavor, but it is unique. It might be nice if they made an intensely choclatey beer using a really dark chocolate. Other flavors are typical bock beer flavors; raisins, cherry, fig. Little to no hop bitterness, but it is there in the far background. I have to give this a low drinkability score because it is a little too sweet and cloying. If the ABV were higher it might make the beer less cloying and enjoyable to drink. Otherwise it sits a little to heavy.","ahking","Feb 25, 2007"

Not a bad nose, but pretty straight forward with those characteristics. Not overly complex. The taste also hits you first with the roasted characteristic but it seems with time (going by my previous review when my palate was less developed) that the chocolate flavor has been subdued. Additionally there is more of a traditional "bock" flavor to the beer. The taste is not necessarily better but it is different. The mouthfeel gives a decent body and nice carbonation, pretty good here. Overall, I think I actually enjoy this more with a bit of time on it. A pretty good beer and not a bad bock if you ask me.

It is also important for me to mention that the date on this bottle is March 2005. At 5.6%, I wouldn't think this would really be palatable after a year and change. Not to mention I got this from a guy I know who works for Sam Adams who has had these since they came out. I have no idea how he stored them. Anyway, it seems to taste fine. The smell, like I said, is mad with milk chocolate; the taste, not so much. When you first take a sip, there's a brief moment where the chocolate is immediately identifiable and fairly strong. Then, just as quickly as it came, it's gone and you're left with some roasted malt and a few flavour profiles I cannot readily identify. The mouthfeel seems thin for what this is supposed to be. It is, however, pretty smooth and drinkable. Overall, I thought this was pretty good, but I am really, really glad that I had someone kind enough to give me a bottle and I didn't spend $16 on this.

Chocolate and roasted malts were most obvious in the taste, with that slightly acidic burnt taste that I often find in porters. In fact, it was bitter, smoky and somewhat burnt, which really reminded me of the Gonzo, but not that quite that pronounced. It was balanced nicely with the milk chocolate sweetness present.

I'd be interested to find out where most of that $15 per bottle is going. High costs for using gourmet chocolate? High costs for the bottle design & packaging? Who knows. You're certainly not paying for a high alcohol content, since this beer doesnt have one (5.6%).

Lots of fruits and a piney quality to the smell. Wow! tons of cocoa flavor to this beer. Not really a traditional bock...it is labeled as an ale. The chocolate stands out more in this beer than any I can remember. That is the predominant flavor, but the hops and esters are playful with the chocolate. Reminds me a little of raisinettes. A definite desert type beer. It is velvety smooth. Not a light beer in color or mouthfeel. It is fun to drink. I just can't see it as the type of beer I could drink all night regardless.

Bittersweet cocoa is balanced with milky (lactose?) flavors make this beer slide down very easily. Round and robust to the palate. Heavy and mild at the same time. No real alcohol to heat, but does give up more thin sweetness. I would prefer more alcoholic notes in a Bock beer. But, it goes down way too easy.

The presentation is a dark amber with larger-than-average white head while the nose is sweet chocolate and raisins.

While I enjoyed the hell out of this beer, and would certainly like to have this around for the holidays, 66 bucks for three beers is a lot of jingle. After the three bottles I didn't seem all that buzzed up so I checked. At only 5.60 ABV this has to be the most expenive beer brewed anywhere. I'm glad that I can say I tried probably one of the best chocholate bocks out there. However, that is one insulting price. Someone ought to resurrect Sam Adams and show him what this stuff costs. He'd probably say, " Look at what they're charging for this beer. The hell with the tea tax. Let's dump the bock in the bay."","cro250klr","Oct 25, 2004"

Darker malt flavors, but not approaching a stout. Sweet chocolate flavor at the end, some bitterness but maybe due to the roasty flavors. Medium body with very low carbonation.

I was surprised when this beer actually tasted excellent, with more than subtle hints of chocolate. The bock taste combinede with the chocolate taste just.... flat out works.

The flavor is not nearly as complex as the aroma, though it is very nice indeed. Nice rich chocolate flavor with a big malt profile. Hops are very subtle but noticeable. Alcohol is kept completely in check. I'm pleasantly surprised with this one. Could use more complexity, but it's very good. Worth the $13.95 my roommate paid for it?

It poured a dark reddish blackish colour, looked like coffee pretty much. It smelled like coffee and chocolate, roasty and sweet. It tasted much like it smelled, but with more chocolate flavour in there. It started out more like roasted malt and finished with dark chocolatey goodness.

It tastes just like Glossette chocolate-covered raisins. Lots of chocolate in the finish. It's fairly bitter, but still sweet. Tangy. Quite roasty. This is a very chocolatey beer.

The taste is sweet, but not overdone...The chocolate character is present through the entire taste. Finish is well balanced. It's lighter in body than I expected, given the smell, and is slightly chalky. Low carbonation. This is a sipping beer to be enjoyed slowly, but the sweetness can be cloying and the chocolate is certainly distracting after the first sips.

The smell was firstly cocoa with some caramel malt and some chocolate as the glass warmed. The taste was dominated by cocoa and chocolate, but it was not overwhelming. The flavor was mildly sweet with some tangy notes in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and medium-low carbonation. The cocoa taste lingered pleasantly. This was a nice, chocolatey brew.","UncleJimbo","Feb 23, 2004"

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark chocolate brown color with lots of ruby orange highlights glowing around the edges and even a bit within the body. Thin frothy tan head, thickly sticking lace in small blobuels. Aroma is a bit subdued and comes across fairly clean with bakers chocolate and light coffee bean freshness with some darker fruits underneath of plum, banana, and raisin. Seems closer to a baltic porter, which wouldn't be bad, but this nose was a bit softer then anticipated. Taste has some nice layers, fairly complex, I get more of the dark fruits of plum, raisin, and a touch of banana sweetness and some solid roasty tones from sweetish black malts giving slight coffee and burnt molasses then I get any real chocolate, which remains lighter then expected as well. A bit of dryness to it like cocoa powder skips about the palate. Feel is slightly buttery and silken smooth with a somewhat thinner body, but respectably solid with some very slight dryish sweet tones within the maltiness and a very mild hop surface. Pretty nice drinking with some nice things going for it, but I found the price of $13 for the fancy engraved label and bottle is way too much for what comes out of it. For a buck more I could've purchased a sixer of Expedtiton.","tavernjef","Feb 21, 2004"

The beer itself is deep brown in color with a ruby hue when held near light. The aroma is mix of creamy chocolate and deep roasted malts. The chocolate aroma is pretty nice, kind of like coco flavored coffee beans without the coffee smell. The taste is really smooth, a mild blend of coco, roasted malt, and a bit of hopiness underneath. It kind of reminds me of a chocolate hoppy nutbrown. The body is right in the middle, just enough to make the flavor last, and the finish is really nice, the flavor fades slowly allowing just enough time to put the glass down and pick it back up. I really like this beer, but at $15 there's no way I would buy more than a couple each year.","HappyHourHero","Feb 19, 2004"

3.28,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,2,"Deep bister hue, with pellucid crimson flashes when held to light. Intially thick tan head recedes into a respectable, dogged layer that yields tattered lace. Buttery, milk chocolate is prevalent in aroma upfront. Slightly smoky black malt with surfaces as the beer breathes, but malt character remains subdued. A trace full cream buttermilk like twang adds an agreeable tartness. It's worth letting this beer sit and oxidize for a while, as the aroma improves considerably in the first few minutes. In flavor, a chilled, confectoner's sugar sweetened cocoa and heavy sweet cream impression dominates and bathes and nearly saturates the palate. Toasty Munich and toffeeish caramalt notes surface only after a long deliberation. Bitterness is woefully understated, with only a hint of carbonaceous black malt and token, paltry hop bitterness. Residual sweetness thus weighs heavily on the palate. Surprisingly, a hair of floral Mittelfruh hop flavor eeks in late only to be promptly overshadowed by nearly cloying cocoa butter and fudge tones. Finishes with a lingering impression of softly toasted, chocolate overrun smores. Yikes. Obviously heavy handed in real chocolate character, but there isn't quite enough of roasted malt basemalt or hop character for support or balance. That being said, as a creation in itself, I rather enjoyed it. The level of chocolate used is more apt to a more ballsy, malt heavy brew such as a foreign or imperial stout. A few of these and you'd up your risk for type II diabetes.","marc77","Feb 17, 2004"
4.09,13,3.5,4.5,4,4,4," It is very smooth with light carbonation, even creamy at times. The chocolate flavor is nice and not overdone, although it does get a bit big. Hot chocolate and milky flavors start you off. The roasty coffee flavors come in a bit later to add needed complexity. The balance is very nice, and it has enough going on to keep it interesting.

The smell was great, the cocoa odor made it oh-so-tempting. Very silky mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like the run-of-the-mill chocolate bocks in that it is more a cocoa powdered backdrop than pure chocolate. It finishes softly and makes you lust for more.

3.53,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a burgundy wine/mahogany, chocolate color, that when held to the light was crystal clear and visually well carbonated. The head that was created was beige in color, not long lasting after the pour and not very full. It quickly fell to a creamy ring on the edges and a small carbonation bubble mat in the middle just floating on the top. Some lace was present and was in sheet form. The aroma was first of chocolate milk, then light hops became present, slightly bitter aroma at times, light coffee and roasted malt. The aroma was not very strong, kind of had to concentrate for some of the smells. The flavors were of bitter cocoa, some malts, cocoa powder (dry), chocolate bar, earth tones, coffee mixed with cream, and as it finished it became slightly dry like cocoa powder was poured in my mouth, just not all the cocoa-ee, and to be honest the carbonation that I saw at the pour was not present on the tongue, kind of flat. The aftertaste was a light cocoa powder. The body was kind of light to medium. Over all impression, OK, not great, would have liked to have more distinct chocolate flavors since that is what it is named. And to be honest for the $20 that the bar threw at me, it was not worth it. Good experience, but not again. I was thinking of getting an extra bottle to take home and age, but I am afraid that it would not last past the expiration date, and I would be out $20. What a shame, such a nice bottle, and to be honest too much hype, not enough back bone.","Jarod","Feb 14, 2004"

Taste: Cocoa addition is very evident soft fruit flavors with toasted malt characteristics floating along in there as well, not overly impressed throwing sixteen dollars down on a bottle it better be amazing save your self some dough and pass on this one. Mouthfeel: Seems thin going down not much of anything that special going on, but then after the first glass from the bottle it starts to sit really heavy on the stomach didn't enjoy the sensation at all. Drinkability: Is this beers major downfall, gets cloying way to fast not enough enjoyment this beer has a lot of lackluster marketing schemes going for it, but if you want a great tasting drinkable beer resist the packaging on this brew.","WVbeergeek","Feb 10, 2004"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A deep, almost black body rests beneath a good sized head of creamy tan foam that holds well before dropping to a wide collar and cottony surface covering; and then leaves thin splashes of lace about the glass. When held to the light the body reveals crystal clear crimson and ruby hightlights that are quite attractive. The nose displays a distinct cocoa-ish note that's soft, sweet, and welcoming. The body is medium full and its very fine, moderate carbonation leaves it lightly creamy across the palate. The cocoa returns in the flavor along with a touch of nuttiness, some vanilla, a mild yeasty fruitiness, and some gentle coffee notes. It's rich but without depth; and leans towards sweetness with its bitterness kept at a minimum, yet there's still enough bitterness present to keep it from becoming cloying. It finishes dry and powdery with a wash of lingering cocoa and some subtle yeasty fruitiness.

3,-17.1,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Dark brown color with significant ruby influences, it doesnt have the depth I was expecting, the faintly beige head reached a solid finger and a half in height. It was rather rocky and the head held pretty well. As the beer was removed, sparse and spotty lacing dotted my glass. Again expectations got me again, the nose was not a chocolate bomb but a decent blend of chocolate milk, grassy hops, toasty malts, and a hint of minerals. The combination works modestly well, the potency is fair at best, but, yeah, it was an inviting aroma. It took many sips before I had any reaction to this beer. I just was waiting for the flavors to kick in and punch my tastebuds silly  they didnt. Yes there are pleasant notes of dry, semi-sweet yet luxurious chocolate, that is very nice but where is the wow factor? Behind the chocolate, but very vocal on its own right, is a firm nuttiness with slight kisses of toasted caramel and a trace of vanilla coffee. The hops are dull, as brewed I assume, and they offer little in the way of flavor, a straight note of grass and that is it. Bitterness? Nope. This is a surprisingly boring offering, it really is, and it seems like a waste of the Scharffen Berger Chocolate, what Nestle wasnt available? Now, you see, I am a big BBC/SA supporter but this one is a dud, on the same level as their Cranberry Lambic. Ouch! The mouthfeel is heavy and tiresome, like walking through a snowdrift; I began to realize I shouldnt have tackled the bottle alone. The carbonation is very low and there is not enough effervesces to lift away the clutter on my tongue, it becomes tacky and overwhelming. I feel like a dope for paying $12 for this 750ml bottle in Sioux Falls, SD. At any price this is not a good beer. I found it to be utterly pointless and after about half a glass it became undrinkable. I cannot recommend you purchasing this beer. Skip it.","bditty187","Feb 03, 2004"

Mouthfeel is lush with low carbonation. Slight astringency late, a little apple pie, but little hop to speak of. The beer is a little on the "one note" side -- pleasant and sweet, but all the laying over gourmet chocolate doesn't make this a particularly drinkable beer to me (or worth the $15).

Front is thickly malt, sweet and chocolate rich with the top light to moderate in its feel to the palate, finish is modest in its acidity, the hops present and pleasing in their spiciness, the aftertaste has a nice chocolate flavor and is quite dry.
