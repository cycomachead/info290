There's also an inch light tan head that stays around for a while. There's a small amount of lacing. The brew mostly smells like cherries, along with some chocolate, cola and plums. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some molasses and a slight medicinal flavor. Also, the chocolate is more noticeable in the flavor of this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy with low/moderate carbonation. I thought it was a good enough brew, definitely worth a try if you've never had it before.","bluejacket74","May 16, 2014"

Even with the word "cherry" in the name, the aroma is surprising and intriguing with how much it reminds me of a freshly opened jar of maraschino cherries. The gimmicky cherry addition doesn't work with the flavor profile, though, with the sweet/sour of the cherries conflicting with the roasted malts and bitter cocoa. The texture is surprisingly light, but the sugary sweetness still makes it a bit syrupy. Overall, the addition of cherries to this recipe is strangely alluring, but the gimmick wears off quickly.","devilben02","Mar 19, 2014"

If you like chocolate covered cherries that are sour then you might like this. Its was the worst of both worlds to me. It was a bad dark beer mixed with a bad cherry Lambic or something like that. I just felt this was one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. But, to each his/her own, someone may love that about it. I am not enamored by this one.

It literally did taste like chocolate cherry cake- it was amazing. It had a great smell, the packaging was bright and eye-catching, the taste was amazing- the cherry was definitely noticeable, but not overpowering (I don't like cherry much to begin with) and the chocolate was certainly present as well, but not overly sweet. Would definitely drink this again!","Une_Petit_Citrouille","Feb 03, 2014"

A waft of maraschino cherries and milk chocolate bursts from the bottle upon opening, and is even more apparent once poured. My initial excitement is quickly dampened, however. The feel of the beer in the mouth is a bit thin. The same can be said of the taste. Cherry syrup and chocolate mousse dominate the pallet but are watered down. Much like the disappointing false promises of light pudding or diet soda, the brew lacks something and does not completely immerse me in an illusion of cherry, chocolatey goodness. I will grant you something, though, Samuel Adams: there is cherry and there is chocolate. Add a little texture, a fuller body, and call me back.","SylviaFaye","Jan 25, 2014"

3.41,-1.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a deep, dark brown with little light coming through and a thin ring of off-white head. It looks quite nice. Scent dominated by maraschino cherry aromas with hints of chocolate. Very sweet, cherry chocolate indeed, but very one note. Taste follows the aroma. A lot of sweet chocolate upfront, moving into more maraschino cherry flavors. A bit of a creamy flavor in the background throughout. Finish is sweet with more cherry flavors and some chocolate. Aftertaste is mostly sweet chocolate. A very sweet flavor profile, very much a dessert beer, but not a very complex one. Its a good combination of flavors if you like chocolate and cherries. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with high carbonation that cuts down the smoothness of the body quite a bit. Still quite easy to drink and with a nice feel, though maybe a bit too soda-like. Overall this is a decent dessert beer, quite sweet, but there is nothing wrong with it at all. It could do with being a bit more beer-like instead of chocolate covered cherry-like, but overall its not bad. Its smooth, drinkable and pleasant enough. My only large complaint is that the carbonation is a bit too high and it could do with more bock in this bock beer.","Auraan","Jan 08, 2014"

Rather interesting aroma for this one, the normal dark malts and clean yeast of a bock are present but so too is a very distinct cherry aroma along with sweet chocolate. I know chocolate is often used to describe stouts and the like but that is always a bittersweet dark chocolate type aroma, this time I get sweet milk chocolate without any bitter characteristic at all. Well there is absolutely no mistaking the cherry in this one. There is even more cherry in here than in the cherry wheat also produced by BBC. It never becomes cloying however because it is balanced by enough bitter malt and a touch of malt sweetness as well, while the cherry wheat doesn't have this balance. Overall it is fairly crisp with low to moderate levels of carbonation and a surprisingly clean finish. Overall this is a pretty nice spin on the bock style a great beer for a cold winters night.","fank2788","Jan 03, 2014"

The beer poured a deep almost opaque dark amber with ecru head that is not leaving much of a lace. The scent carries cherries and chocolate. The taste is very similar to the scent and is very sweet...almost like a cherry coke. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation.

3.31,-4.6,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this beer was just barely decent and It really isn't recognizable as a bock, but I think it's a pretty average example of a fruit infused dark beer. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, rich, a little filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I have no urge to drink another one in a row, i think that artificial cherry taste would really wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were both nice and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the cherry aspect, it was just too artificial for me and I would have have liked it to taste more natural and a little tart. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, it's just not for me and I would only recommend it to people who like that same cherry aspect that's in their Cherry Wheat. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, I liked the original Chocolate Bock much more and I don't think the cherry helped this beer out. This was my least favorite beer in this years winter seasonal variety pack. I wasn't a big fan of this years winter variety pack, I thought last years was much better. Better luck next guys, Chocolate Bock was fine just the way it was.","StoutHunter","Dec 13, 2013"

But, in truth, I actually enjoyed it. Not as good as the original, and I would have liked a bit more chocolate flavor, but it was easily my favorite of the variety pack and it lessened the emotional blow I took when discovering I would be without my beloved Chocolate bock for at least another year(possible forever). The best way to describe the taste of this beer is to be simple: it tasted like a cherry tootsie pop.

Very slight sweetness but there's something at the finish that I can't put my finger on. Very artifically cherryish. Somewhat overwhelming but subtle.

Good desert brew.","mikeg67","Nov 27, 2013"
4.13,19,4,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"O: To be honest I was a little nervous when I heard that they added cherry to the bock because I remembered the cherry wheat that, to put it in kind words, was like drinking cough syrup. This however, was very well balanced and the cherries complimented the roasted notes very well. I never felt like it was too sweet or that there was cough syrup in it. I am pleasantly surprised at how well this beer turned out to be and am glad that the Boston Beer Company went for the risk to change up the annual bock.","Weston19","Nov 26, 2013"

3.13,-9.8,3.75,3.25,3,3.25,3,"Served icy at Matthew's 1600 in Catonsville, MD. Wonderful to have a draught option of a beer previously unbeknownst to me. After the obligatory warming period, with frigid phalanges to boot, I gazed. Dark, dark, dark, ah, but what's that I see at the bottom of the glass? Gorgeous deep red peeks through the storm. Upon lowering my nose towards it, I'm hit with a tidal wave of cherry. Subtly would have been appreciated. My tongue confirms what my nose suspects. CHERRY. Creamy swishing makes for a mildly above average mouthfeel. Aftertaste is lingerful. About 2/3 thru the glass, the chocolate became more prominent. Sammy Adams, you've out-cherried yrself again.","Rast","Mar 20, 2013"
3.03,-12.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Served in the Sam Adams glass this beer has a weak tan head that dissipates quickly. Brown with garnet highlights and clear. Aromas of cherry and chocolate for sure. A bit of a cola aroma. Taste is chocolate cherry cola-weird. Weak on grainy malts or hops this beer is high on carbonation and weak in body given the ABV. A fairly easy beer to drink-recommended for someone looking for a beery cherry cola. A sweet dessert beer.","deebo","Mar 19, 2013"

Anyway, it pours a dark, ruby-tinted black-brown topped by a half-finger of dirty ashen foam. The nose explodes with black cherry, with a light bit of roasted malts behind the din. It's pleasant, indeed, but seems a bit one-sided. The taste holds notes of somewhat-artificial-seeming black cherry, chocolate powder, light roasted malts, toasted caramel, and a hint of toasted coconut. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a nice beer, but the cherry seems to have diluted the usually very nice Chocolate Bock.

The smell of this beer was pretty nice, it had a very sweet smelling cherry aroma filling my nose along with just a bit of malts in the background. The taste is sweet with loads of cherry the dark chocolate kind of shows up late in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was decent, it was well carbonated and was drinkable. Overall I feel that this beer is basically a blend of the Cherry Wheat and the Chocolate back that is released in the winter. There really isn't too much special about it other than it goes well with a sweet dessert. To be honest that beer could have been dessert and it would have done the job just fine. This is the beer I was anticipating the most from the beer dinner and it turned out to probably be my least favorite.","Knapp85","Aug 04, 2011"

These aren’t even cherries, where did you get these? Is this a joke?” Tyler shot up out of his seat, once again, the jig was up, somehow every produce manager that he encountered knew exactly what a cherry looked like and apparently this was wholly dissimilar to juniper berries. “YOU DIDN’T EVEN GIVE THEM A TRY!” He cried out and spiked his apron on the ground in frustration before bolting out of the room.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jun 23, 2011"

3.65,5.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5," The taste is good as it has a pretty strong cherry and chocolate taste which lives up to the name, however it causes the bock base to get a little lost in the flavor. I get a light malt in the middle after some of the cherry zing and chocolate pizzazz wheres off slightly. This bock finishes fruity and semi-sweet with gentle bitterness. Overall an ok bock, it would probably appeal to those who like sweet and fruity beers more than the craft fan, but it is not your average bock and you know that going in.","Slatetank","Apr 11, 2011"
