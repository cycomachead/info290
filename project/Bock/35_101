The taste pretty much followed suit but added a little extra with some nice spiciness.  This was not overpowering it was just enough to keep it lively.  Nothing to really hold my attention or make me yearn for another one.  Overall it is a Sam Adams and usually they are all just average drinkable beers.  I hate to say that because I have just moved from Vermont and love the New England Area beers but Sam Adams just seems to produce more average brews than strong ones and this beer, Winter Lager, just happens to be one of the average ones.","VTR","Dec 28, 2014"

The winter lager isn't generally a favorite of mine but it isn't a bad beer. It's exceptionally average in many regards while being above in a few. There is a pretty nice balance in the flavor of malt and hops, which is a staple of the Bock style and the highlight of the drink. Not their best brew in my opinion, but a worthy bock and a decent holiday staple.","Jaysauras","Nov 25, 2014"

The aroma is quite strong which bothers me somewhat. Very grainy smell with a slight element of not fresh bread or vegetables that for me is slightly off putting. Upon first tasting, the flavor reflected the aroma. However, the taste develops into a pleasant blend of earthy spices, grainy malt and smooth finish. Feel is medium bodes with light carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer to enjoy in the winter, but not my favorite.","Gajo74","Nov 22, 2014"

3.5,-2.5,,,,,,"Bottle from the 12 pack Pours a slightly hazy brown amber color with a decent off white head that persists for a while leaving spotty lace on the sides. Aromas of cinnamon and citrus with a caramel brown sugary malt to back it up. The flavor is rich and dark sugary malts with a spicy citrusy bite to counter. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I’ve had this many times in the past and its never been my favorite, but today with a grilled cheese and some cracked pepper chips it just worked.","johnnnniee","Nov 15, 2014"

Initial taste is sweet from a balance of malts, hops, and the brewed orange peels. The finishing taste is created from the persistence of the orange peels combined with cinnamon and  a hint of ginger. Seems like it would be a great beer to drink next to the fireplace on a cold day.","Myotus","Nov 11, 2014"

I liked it better at the beginning than toward the end.  I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me, and I might seek it out in a situation where the only alternatives are Bud Light and other weak AALs.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Nov 09, 2014"

As for taste, very strong hops, with a bit of spice.  The mouthfeel is smooth. Overall, I find this beer drinkable, but I much prefer the regular Boston Lager. I don't generally like bock beers.

The taste of the caramel malts comes right though with some toffee, cinnamon and nutmeg in the mix as well. Very tasty with perfect carbonation. Medium-bodied. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. A tasty brew for the cooler months.","BeerWithMike","Mar 12, 2014"

Aroma of mild caramel malt, slight holiday spicing. Flavor of sweet caramel malt, mild toffee, light cinnamon, finishes with caramel malt and light grassy hops. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A pleasant light bock style beer with an appropriately mild holiday spicing. Is as I expect from Boston Beer, a nicely made, mellow ale that doesn't push the envelope, but is a satisfactory and enjoyable example of its style.","LiquidAmber","Feb 12, 2014"

4.43,23.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Samuel Adams Winter Lager is one of my winter favourites. Its a very full bodied and bold beer by any standards. Rather complex and filling but more willing to let you have another after another. I've had Sam Adams Winter Lager in a bottle, can, and on tap. Honestly there's no difference in taste other than the can is a wee bit more foamy like other Sam Adams cans available. The appearance is more of a dark brownish black like most bock beers and dark lagers. Looks imitating at first to most light beer drinkers but its easy to get used to. Smellwise its more of a full bodied smell with a bit of ginger in there. Tastewise its a rather complex beer without being too pretentious in itself. Very full and bold with some ginger and spices that aren't easily obvious. In the mouth Sam Adams Winter Lager is very tame and smooth. Very odd for a full Bock Lager like as such really. Overall Samuel Adams Winter Lager is probably the best winter beer available in my opinion. I mean I do like Harpoon's, Narragensetts, or Long Trails offerings but Sams Winter Lager will always be a winter favourite. Even though I prefer Octoberfest but Winter is a close second.","bullseyestrat","Dec 25, 2013"

Color is quite nice, a clear dark amber/light ruby Not too much of a nose to it, malt with a touch of spice and a slight citrus hop aroma. Beer itself tastes about the same. Malty, get a touch of cinnamon and residue bite from the ginger, then hops which aren't very heavy. Feels a little thin in the mouth, like something the should be for thirst quenching in the summer. Pretty good overall, one of the better Sam seasonals I've had, wouldn't turn one down.","Twobeards","Dec 22, 2013"

3.6,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Snagged a six-pack from the same place I found the superlative Lagunitas Little Sumpin' (see that review). I am a big advocate of Boston Lager and like this brewery well enough, gimmicks like "chocolate cherry porter" notwithstanding. Why does everyone have to murder porter with all kinds of additives and random flavorings like chai spices and sock lint? Its not already an interesting style? Its kinda like how a beer is magically made "wintery" by chucking in some spices. Bock is already supposed to be pretty hearty and rich. Ahem. I digress. This winter bock pours a rather pretty red-orange amber color, with around three fingers of light tan foam and a pleasant aroma of mellow rich dark malts, caramel, molasses, a little sour dark fruit like sultanas. Nice but the whole aroma is downplayed, like great song on the radio that you want to crank up but the volume knob is unfortunately busted. Taste is similar, with some toasty bread crusts, biscuits, barley-based coffee substitute and crackers, subdued caramel and molasses as per the nose, and candied plums along with herbal/spicy hop notes. Some would have the cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel spice addition amped up. I respectfully disagree. This is actually an example of skilled spice use in brewing, the spices provide a background warmth and some aromatics but not at the expense of everything else. I get a little sulphur on the nose and perhaps the palate as well, maybe a hint of DMS, but at expected levels for a lager and these components add complexity without being nasty. Fairly light body but semi-chewy nonetheless and the finish is quite nice: The malts stick around, there's some hop leaf and a floral sweet spice like licorice tablets. Has some of the sweet and sour character of old world porters. This beer used to be higher ABV and more flavorful (or so I read, wasn't into beer back then), too bad its been neutered a bit because its pretty good now and must have been even better "back in the day". Compare it to Anchor Bock, which has bolder flavors but perhaps less complexity.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 23, 2013"

Great to enjoy on a cold night. A pinch too sweet to make this a session beer. Worth trying but is low on my list of must-have winter seasonals.","Chiefy770","Nov 22, 2013"

The head doesn't stick around long and their isn't much lacing but not a big deal. The scent is a lot like the taste, very balanced with very very light citrus and some other spices which Sam Adams claims cinnamon among, although it isn't easy to pick up anything specific. I actually got some ginger and something of a coriander scent although I doubt it's actually in the beer but that's fine I like coriander. The mouth-feel is pleasant and full....not too water and not too creamy, like I said balance was their aim here. The taste is very pleasant with a bouquet of spices and notes, none of which jump out at you, but I think that's why this recipe works so well. Hints of ginger and orange for sure and you will get some cinnamon on the taste, something I didn't get from the scent. This is a very very smooth beer and this is something anyone can enjoy. Some of the more "refined" beer snobs might be a bit disappointed with the "lack" of complexity or boldness but putting this in perspective as a fine seasonal brew, I think it's pretty damn good and would recommend this to anyone.","Khad","Nov 10, 2013"

The spices make the smell and taste rather confusing. The beer is crisp but offers nothing special in the mouthfeel, and overall the beer tastes mediocre and confusing.

It has a light aroma of light grain, orange peel and ginger. It has a smooth, medium body with a light, slightly watery finish. The mouth is left just a little gritty. It's lightly flavored with malt and orange peel. There's a little bitterness after the swallow. This is where the ginger and cardamom come out. This is just kind of a simple session beer. It doesn't have a lot of personality, but it's certainly quaffable.","yesyouam","May 05, 2013"

Aroma is winter-esque spices, but nothing really stands out. It all just sort of blends. The taste is about the same. There is definitely some winter spice action here, but at the end, there isn't really anything distinct and it sort of tastes muddled. It's certainly not bad, but I just feel like focusing on one or two of the seasonal spices would make this beer more distinct.","delta490","Mar 20, 2013"

3.68,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best before May 2013. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apple, pear, caramel, ginger, toast, grass, cracker, light pepper, and herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and solid complexity. Taste of apple, pear, caramel, toast, cracker, grass, ginger, light cinnamon, light citrus, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, bread, grass, ginger, light cinnamon, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; with a nice subtle balance of the added spices; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good bock style. Good flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; and extremely smooth to drink. This was a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 08, 2013"

3.11,-13.4,4.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a candied brown, bordering on amber, with a huge fluffy cream head with yellowing notes. The beers body is lager clean, completely free of any haze, and quite translucent, though the beer’s darkness does fight this a little bit. The lacing is fat and sticky, leaving webbing behind on my mug. On the nose, the beer smells spicy, with a little too much cinnamon burn and a note of ginger. Slight citrus notes are found when the glass is swirled, and underlying all the smells is a caramelly smell that is tinged with wheat. The beer tastes abrasively spicy with a clear cinnamon burn that seems to hurt the other flavors. The beer begins with light caramel malts and slight cinnamon before opening into a slightly biscuity malt that is immediately torn out of the mouth by the cinnamon spice which drowns out most other notes and lingers in the mouth. Slight hints of the ginger and orange peel can be felt at the fringes of the palate, and perhaps a touch of grassy hops can be tasted, but this is all below the cinnamon, which is rocking around on the palate like an unwanted elephant. This flavor is much spicier than I recall it being in years past, and is really hurt by the overwhelming cinnamon. Now, when I say it tastes like cinnamon, I don’t mean the nice cinnamon flavors of a baked good, but the burn with a slight bitter flavor that you get from putting too much cinnamon in your mouth… In case anyone was thinking I was just complaining about the taste of cinnamon… On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with a slight chew to it. Carbonation gives a little bite in the beginning, and then mellows over the tongue to provide a clean drink, though the spices punch nasty burns on my tongue. The mouth is left dry with a spice burn after the beer has left, with saliva only on the very edges of my tongue. Overall, this is a very heavy handed beer. I’ve had a couple of this year’s batch, and I have to say that the Boston Beer Company really overdid the spice this year. On their site they claim they searched far and wide this year to bring the best cinnamon sticks all the way from Vietnam, and while I applaud them on finding cool foreign ingredients, I wish they would stop playing with a recipe that tasted perfectly fine last year. This beer needs to tone down its spice so that other flavors can be enjoyed. I am a little weirded out that no one else has said anything else about the spice for this years version, so maybe it was just my pack, though that would be very strange... Perhaps its just my palate? Anyways, its cheap and easily found so try it for yourself, don't trust my opinion.","Maxwell","Dec 29, 2012"

I was surprised at the rich taste of this lager - rivaling their Boston Lager in my opinion. I could distinctly taste everything I smelled from the bottle making it a great experience. Overall, I rated it a little lower since the beer did leave an aftertaste that didn't agree with me.

Scents of caramel, sweet malt, sweet spices, cinnamon-like and dark fruit. A pretty good aroma profile, sweet, spicy and inviting. Flavor begins with sweet malt and caramel, with a moderate level of floral hop bitterness. This moves into some indeterminable sweet spices in the middle alongside the malt, caramel and hops and some breadiness and toasty malt flavors. The finish continues those flavors with a nice aftertaste of caramel and floral hops. A good, malty, sweet, yet not cloying flavor profile. Quite balanced between sweetness and hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink, fairly dry and slightly creamy. Overall not a bad Winter beer. Its got a good mix of sweet malt, hops and spices in both aroma and flavor that balance well together and make for a good drink. I'd go back to it.","Auraan","Nov 17, 2012"

There is a slight citrus and a very faint alcohol aroma as well. Taste has typical lager characteristics, the spiciness comes through right away along with a slight sweetness and the beer is balanced with a nice bite towards the finish. High carbonation, medium body, and watery mouthfeel. This beer is slightly above average. Similar in flavor to Boston Lager with more spice character. To me there is definitely an off flavor present in this beer that leads to an almost stale character.

The bottle mentions some cinnamon and nutmeg, and it's there, but appropriately it's more in the background. A very enjoyable beer. I even get a tinge of sourness or something in there on the finish which makes this beer pretty thirst quenching.

Notes of pine, cardamom, and orange drift of the very thick head, and when you discover that the brewery used ginger, cinnamon, and orange zest to make their winter seasonal the melange of aromas makes sense. On the tongue, just what you'd expect form a great snow seasonal; mild hop presence, a slight ginger bite mixed a fuller sweetness from the cinnamon and orange, thick and creamy (reminiscent of cream sodas), with a warm lingering finish. A perfect beer for sipping near the fireplace, enjoying conversation with good friends in a cozy room, or snuggling up with that special someone. Bypass food with this pint, it shines all on it's own, and strongly echoes the flavors of the season. Open one up, and find some mistletoe...cheers!","Seekerpilgrim","Nov 11, 2012"

3.75,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours clear dark copper with a soapy, quickly dissipating white head. The carbonation appears to be mild. The aroma is of bready malt with some caramel sweetness. The spices are pretty subtle. I get some of the orange zest and the cinnamon and ginger. There's a nice malt backbone here with some cinnamon and ginger bite that builds up as you drink it. I get the orange zest as well. There's the caramel sweetness that adds to the backbone pretty well. There is also some hop bitterness in the back. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is pretty high. This is a very good beer that I enjoy drinking when it comes into season.","acevenom","Nov 11, 2012"

3.82,6.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a transparent burnt caramel/honey color with a modest cream-colored head that leaves little to no lacing. Aroma is sweet and spicy, but not overbearing. Medium to light bodied, the flavor is malty up front with a complement of seasonal spices. Prickly carbonation makes it difficult to dissect the spice profile, though the bottle mentions cinnamon and ginger. There's also a faint wheatiness lurking beneath the surface as well. Hop flavors are pretty well subdued, which I actually prefer, and the finish manages to subside without any objectionable aftertaste, leaving a sweet, malty stickiness that lingers on the lips. On the whole, Sam Adams Winter Lager is a respectable and easy to drink seasonal brew with enough flavor and complexity to keep you interested for the entire glass.","MaximalC","Apr 09, 2012"

Drank this out of a bottle with April as the notched as the month to drink by for best taste. Got this at my local krogers on sale in the Winter Variety pack. Good looking brew poured into my pint glass. The smell is bready with strong orangy overtones. I think this beer tastes great. Hops and spices from start to finish. Overall a great winter lager. cheers!","rdunigan","Mar 11, 2012"

It pours a nice amber brown into a glass and retains a small little head for the first half of the beer. After that, the appearance can begin to fail a bit as it loses its carbonation and (too large) of pieces of spice/flower begin floating around in the glass. As much as I like real solid pieces of the mix in my brew, these can get in the way of just enjoying the drink. However, comparatively to other winter brews, this is definitely one of my favorite American choices. I enjoy most of Samuel Adams' brews, and this is one my favorite of their extensive lineup.","shigg85","Feb 15, 2012"

Overall it tastes very much like a pumpkin beer. The cinnamon is pretty noticeable. The finish has a nice spicy bite, but there is a little metallic aftertaste that did not sit well with me.

Some nutty malt character in there too, maybe some nutmeg? Overall the flavors don't coalesce well. Not too sure what to make of this, not really looking forward to finishing the glass either. edit: drank a 2nd one straight from the fridge a few weeks later, didn't seem as bad.

3.83,6.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I poured from the bottle into my usual truncated conical glass. The head was a finger width of tan foam that faded to light lacing. A ruby amber hue in color, much like American iced tea, was evident when the glass was held to the light. the aroma starts off with a sweet caramel malt note, and then fades to a faint of spice and hops. The taste hit in two waves... The first was the malty bready taste, and faded to a nice spice/hop note. The after taste the ginger made a subtle but clear presence that was nice as well. Mouth feel was light to medium with a good bit of carbonation tickling my tongue. Over all I like this seasonal. The spices were a little on the light side in aroma and taste, but this beats over doing it by a wide margin. It's a good seasonal lager overall, but it's not outstanding to where I would go out of my way to buy it again.... Fortunately for this beer my regular store stocks it, so a few more six packs will be consumed.","Rantingfury","Nov 13, 2011"

Even as it warms there’s not a very noticeable aroma. Muted, malty. Taste is a different matter as I can definitely catch a blend of holiday spices with each sip.

4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"(From backlog.) On-tap at Carraba's. Looking at the pour, it seems just like Boston Lager: bronze liquid with a smallish ecru cap, and radiant translucence. There is a small amount of hop character in the nose, which plays out as fruity-floral and spicy on the palate, atop a dry and biscuity malt base. Again, I see very little difference between this and Boston Lager. Nice feel, very crisp. Easy drinking overall, although I prefer BBCSABL over BBCSAWL.","ktrillionaire","Jul 15, 2011"

The mouthfeel is carbonated enough to make the mouth tingle but smooth enough to drink several if one chooses too.

(dummy) Due to the lacking head, I can only describe the head as having properties of darkish sweet malts and some spices. The taste was quite impressive to me. Taste is of dark malts as well as a slight wheat flavor, there are also elements of spices, very good. Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is refreshing.

The flavor is more defined, with a sweet caramel malt base contrasted by a bit of earthy, peppery hops, but it all just seems a bit stale. The added spices are not distinct themselves, but they instead build on the dull earthiness of the hops. The mouthfeel is fine, but it doesn't do anything to prop up the dull, dreary flavor profile.

I got a finger of deep-tan head with good retention off of my pour. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. I have seen pennies that were less copper-colored than this beer. I was reminded (again) of the beauteous Linda Lou, a striking redhead whose hair was not only this color, but hers was also as coarse as wire. Sigh. She left me while I was on a seven-month deployment to marry somebody other than me. My beer may taste faintly of salty tears. Boo hoo. Nose smelled of ginger (OK, now a reference might be getting old), cinnamon and nutmeg. I was reminded of baking cookies with my maternal grandmother as a kid. The other kids used to make fun of me for my culinary endeavors until they tried what I had made. I still like to cook, just not for by myself. If only I had Linda Lou for whom to make meals ... Mouthfeel was big, thick, creamy. You should really brace yourself for this one. The spices were simply alive on the tongue, each getting a turn on the ol' palate. It was like eating one of those cookies. The finish left me in a melancholy, nostalgic mood but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Good news, also, for my followers - it CAN be purchased outside of the Winter Sampler, unlike Old Fezziwg. Try some for yourself.","woodychandler","Dec 24, 2010"

The taste is very similar, but a bit spicier: Newcomers nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and cola add some complexity to the flavor, but seem to somewhat overshadow the other parts. Or, rather, it comes in phases. However you prefer to hear it, everything doesn't mesh perfectly. Yeah. The body is a nice medium, with a moderate carbonation and a semi-grainy feel.

Like I said this blends very well with that cereal malt wheat taste that Samuel Adams uses in some of their beers. The cinnamon blends in so well as well. The hops are very mild but mix in with the orange corriander like finish. There is also some very slight ginger in there as well to mix in with the cinnamon and malts used which reminds you of Christmas in a way.

Mouthfeel is very creamy and full, leaving my mouth well hydrated. This is great stuff, and I'll look for it again next winter.","Riccymon","Mar 07, 2009"

The smell was hard to quantify perhaps due to the restaurant surroundings but light malt and even a lighter spice were present. The taste was first sweet malt (caramel?) and spice (nutmeg, allspice?) with a very light hop finish overshadowed by the spice.

There is a light to medium mouth feel, slightly sticky. This is a sessionable beer for when the mercury starts to drop.

There are slightly muted hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, malty sweetness subdued overall with a burned caramel. Taste is all over the place, spice, sweet, malts all hit the taste buds. It's not a stand out beer - but one that you can easily go back to. Feel is lighter then expected in a winter lager.

There is a sweetness that comes out more when the beer is poured. The beer is sweet, bitter, and toasty. It's almost like an oktoberfest with a focus on complexity rather than drinkability. There is the usual lager crispness that is expected though. The sweetness tastes absolutely wonderfull.

Out of the bottle this beer was a copper/amber color leaning towards the dark side with some visible rising carbonation. The head was tan, displayed nice retention and lacing too. The aroma was mostly spices and malt with some sweetness. The flavors were first caramel and chocolate malt blended with winter spices, nutmeg and cinnamon followed by a bite of hoppiness at the end. The suddenness of the hops gave the beer a slightly astringent quality. Still, the body was medium, the carbonation average and the mouthfeel good.

I was really expecting some roasted malts in this but was a little let down. The flavor made sense though because the label says "a dark WHEAT lager brewed with winter spices."

This was probably due to the glassware at the bowling alley, so I still gave it a 3.5 for appearance. If I were judging it against style, it doesn't taste like a bock to me. If I were judging it as a continental lager, or a European dark lager, it would get big points. The malty flavor dominates, but it's not too sweet. I drank it pretty quickly, so it must have been decent. For the record, it was the only beer that I had tonight, so I feel confident in my rating.","BrewmasterNPB","Feb 16, 2008"

3.97,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A classic winter beer, and one of my favorite Sam Adams, probably second on my list behind the Boston Lager. The appearance is the weak point of the beer, the color is a nice amber color but the head was small and quickly diminishing. The aroma is malt sweetness balanced with Christmas spices and a little bit of toastyness. There is also a slight background of hops and fruity esters. The spices come out more pronounced in the flavor balanced with sweet toasty malt. The mouthfeel is crisp as would be expected with a lager, and is a very drinkable beer.","tigerdoc","Dec 08, 2007"

I wonder if the shape of the specialty glass is behind this apparent anomaly? As the head fades a spotty lacing is left behind for a few drinks. Aromatically there is a very faint hint of spice that precedes some malty goodness. Tastes of sugar, syrup and sweet malts that are perfectly balanced by the hops. Mouthfeel is nice and light bodied yet fulfilling. This is a highly drinkable and tasty beverage that leaves me gratified.","stephens101","Dec 07, 2007"

The aroma is unremarkable, a little spice note, but hops are definitely out to lunch. There's a little bit of malt sweetness that's balance by a light spice presence. the spicing is done well, it doesn't hit you over the head with any particular clove, ginger, or other spices. I had a few bottles of Lakeshore Brewery's winter beer a few years back that got relegated to beer bread duty because the spices were so overwhelming. Not a problem here. Rather light-bodied, but not out of style for this lager. The light body and carbonation make this quite drinkable, and the spicing is subtle enough to be interesting as you try to tease out the various flavors.

This is my first plain old "bock" so doppels are what I'm comparing it to. Taste is again very Sam, but with a sweeter husky backbone than the standard Boston lager. Im drinking this too cold (my buddy had this in the fridge unlike the cellar temps I ususally drink at) for a fair comparisons, and it needs to warm up. Once it does, the wheat is more detectable, and it makes this a bit more rounded ain unique, though its not light years away in taste from other sam beers. Mouthfeel is medium, nothing startling here. On part and satisfactory. Overall its better than most beers I take a chance on, but not one I'll be crazy about buying, though one I'd pick over others in a generic tap list. Of note, there was a twelver of this at a small mixed gathering I went to, and I found many of the bottles left on the table half empty or nearly full, meaning many of the non-craft drinkers tried it and left it on the table, sadly. This makes my heart both sad and glad, as to a craft drinker some Sam brew can seem almost macro, until you put it next to the thirty pack of coors light at a celebration and realize, it really isn't even close to being tasteless, non-threatening swill.","Liquids","Jan 13, 2007"

That means the color is a nice healthy shade of copper. The smell is and dominated by the malts with the hops relatively subdued in the background. As is usually the case, the smell was indicative of the taste which was dominated by the malts with the hops more in the background. The malt character is similar to the regular Boston Lager. The taste is strong, fairly sweet, complex, but still very clean. The main difference I noticed is that the hops are more sublte. They are there and provide a nice balance, but there's less of that dry intrusive hoppy bitterness as compared to the non-seasonal Boston Lager. All in all this was an excellent beer and the subtler hops make this an easy choice for a session beer. Watch out for that increased alcohol content though.","casualbeerman","Jan 03, 2007"

Not especially high in alcohol (5.8%) and not overly malty. There are some wintery spicey noted in the background. Perhaps a little citrusy? It's probably the mildest winter beer you will ever encounter. It's OK, but the sweetness gets a little tiring after you've put back one or two.

The label mentions spices, but if present, they were in the background in a supporting role because the smell and taste said malt first with touch of hops for balance.

Low bitterness, again with some crackery malt and caramel sweetness. Mild spices kicked in towards the end. The body seemed heavier than it was due to a slight syrupy character that appeared after a few sips. Carbonation was a little on the higher side and it was a bit dry.

The mouthfeel is just right for a lager. The taste to me, is like a weaker version of Sam Adams Old Fezziwig Ale. The spices arent as strong, and the beer not as thick, but still very enjoyable.

3.88,8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This one has been available in Alberta for a while, but I have always forgot to review it on here. Blue labelled 300ml bottle, with a bit on the back telling about the "Saigon Cinnamon" used in brewing this winter beer. The beer's colour is a lovely ruby/off purple colour that shimmers a hazy nectarine hue. The head is solid and billowy, slightly dimpled with good staying power. It stayed at perfect level, just topping the glass. The foam is a dirty dull white, hints of light red and brown throughout. Thick islands of lace. A great looking spiced beer, perfect for the dinner table in winter. The aroma is subtle and warming, with the promised cinnamon aroma and a light but grainy malt that is sweet but balanced with a little citrus hopping. There is some tangy lime or apricot in the smell, adding a little salinity. The tangy fruits actually become more pronounced the farther you go with this beer's aroma, and I found it a little odd. It just feels as though it should not be there next to the cinnamon and dark malts. However, besides that the aroma is very nice, with the likes of maple syrup, brown sugar, buttered bread, a little black licorice, and other anonymous spices. Inhaling in close with the nose very near there are some very sugary candy notes as well. All of this with no off-putting strongness or alcohol astringency; this is a very subtle but appetising aroma. Warm, soft, almost relaxing. The taste is medicinal and full of cinnamon and brown bread malts. There is some clove and and other spices that seem to remind me of my grandmother's kitchen. Cumin, caraway. Definite licorice and horehound here. The malts are nicely combined with the volume to give a light barleywine flavour as well. The taste is woody and vinous, with a full body and low, creamy carbonation. Drinkability is high, and this goes down easily in both winter and summer. A nice little dark lager. Fulfilling and easy to drink.","Cwrw","Apr 29, 2006"

Sweet caramel malt and cinnamon aroma up front, with some nutmeg and light hops in the background. Sweet, sweet caramel malt flavour--almost to the point of be cloyingly sweet, but not quite--blends well with that Saigon cinnamon they mention on the back label, it's what also jumps to the forefront at first. Then comes some banana flavour, nutmeg, clove and some ginger, rounded out nicely with some light spicy hops. And the mouthfeel is gorgeous: full, rich and velvety smooth for any style of lager, it hugs you from the inside. It's a month before it's best before date still, and I'm fully enjoying this winter warmer on a hot sunny day in April. Good stuff, glad I happened across it at the last minute.

The malt is caramelly and bread-like, but not real strong in flavor. It tastes very clean like a lager should be, and its well carbonated.

There is a bit of a nutmeg and cinnamon taste in the beginning and a slight bit of fruitiness in the background. The malt is king here though. As I already mentioned, it has a fair amount of sweetness, but this is cut by a nice toasted malt element that provides a biscuity taste, which keeps the sweetness from becoming cloying. The mouthfeel is fairly chewy for a lager, adding a nice amount of sturdiness. It is fairly drinkable, though it becomes a bit less appealing when it warms up. This is a tasty and harty winter-time lager. A nice choice when out and about and faced with the same old offerings.","Hagbard","Jan 24, 2006"

As soon as they got the Sam Adams tap working, I was on it!!!! Appearance was good. I didn'[t notice a great head but it left some lacing and had a nice coppery/caramel color. Could definitely smell the spices, I'm figuring cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor was nicely balanced between the spices and malt flavor. Nothing too overpowering. The spices were noticible first and then smooth, rich malt and spice flavor. This beer is heavier and has a stronger mouthfeel than what I am used to (lagers, marzens and Pale Ales). It was very drinkable. I would have enjoyed something else to wash down dinner and then switch to this afterwards and just enjoy the rich flavor for it's own sake.

I taste a decent spice flavor. Cinnamon flavors are noticable. It has a very slight hop flavor, but it is almost not detectable. This beer goes down smooth leaving a spicy, biscut like aftertaste.

Big thick flavors of caramel, cookie and wheat, along with some herbs, leathery yeast and something else I cant put my finger on. It has a much larger body than expected and is lightly syrupy with low carbonation. Its a very interesting offering from BBC. Very enjoyable, and a bit on the low end of the spectrum of winter warmers as far as spices go, which is a good thing in my opinion. I hate when brewers go overboard on things like pickling spice.

Strong malt sweetness from the wheat and an unrefined sugar taste; with a healthly hop bitterness that balances it out. Medium body and active carbonation leave only a touch of residual sweetness, and renders a good drinkability at the cost of the appropriate alcohol warmth.

The nutty malts come through, though there's a lot of other flavors that sort of seem to take a back seat. Nothing really meshes well with this beer, it's just sort of a hodge-podge of grains and water. Not a thrilling mouthfeel either, a tad watery.

Once I was strictly into the beer, it was smooth, although maybe a little too much carbonation for this type of beer.

The Winter Lager is a great start and did not disappoint. It pours a beautiful bright amber color with a slight off-white head about 1/4 inch thick. Not a great deal of aroma here, but I pick up small scents of nutmeg or cinammon that you may expect from a winter selection, plus some light hops and malt. The taste is nice with a good balance of hops and malt, and I also pick up a slight bitter fruity taste, almost reminding of the after-taste of a fresh sour apple. Carbonation is excellent and the lager fills your mouth and body with a jolt of wamth that you would hope for in a winter warmer. Drinkability is above average, as I could see myself drinking a number of these at a holiday gathering.

That's about all the bad that I have to say about this beer. The taste had an amazing complexity. Caramel malty sweetness upfront followed by a roasted barley flavor that holds for the duration of the drink. The spices are perfect in amount and flavor. There seems to be a good amount of cinnamon, which I love, and ginger but they never get too strong and mix beautifully with the malts and hops, just perfect. Hops are spicy and have a European flavor to them. They seem to come with the spices but pick up towards the finish. Slightly belly warming on the way down, which is the intent of this beer right.

They do come out in the flavor, however, once the rich, wheaty and caramel-glazed maltiness subsides a little bit; and they stick around to linger in the aftertaste. A bit of cinnamon is discernable, and perhaps some nutmeg, but overall the spices are nicely restrained, lending more to balance than flavor. And it's really well-balanced with the spices working in tandem with the low-key bitterness to balance the malt and dry the finish. A slap of delicately spicy noble hop ties everything together throughout; and it's alternating sweet malt - spicy finish keeps it really drinkable. Nicely done!

Not bad, but this is easily my least favorite beer from Boston Beer Co. The flavors are sort of indistinct, with an odd roughness to the overall feel.

Some light notes of dark fruits are also present. Hops are light, but noticeable. Nice start with malt, bread notes, and light flavor of dark fruits. Spices similar to the aroma come to the foreground next. Hop finish balances out the brew nicely, and lingers for a short period. Not being a huge lager fan to start with, I wasnt expecting much.

This beer is brewed with "winter spices" but I'm not sure which of these are present. I smell a bit of cardamom and perhaps a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I don't know that I can taste the spices, although there is peculier dryish character towards the finish that reminds me of nutmeg. The tawny malt flavors of this beer give it additional character. The finish is bit fruity yet fairly dry. One of the better winter beers, especially when fresh.

I really enjoyed the rich, bold color of this lager and could hardly wait to dive into it after a long night at work. The taste is very clean. There isn't a lot of extra spices in there, which is something I've come to expect from winter brews. In fact, I was looking for more of a holiday beer. What I got was a very drinkable lager.

Finish is modestly carbonated, the hops relatively unobtrusive in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste, another of those benign beers that are just plain good to drink when youre not in the mood for a Bad Boy beer.

White head of about one finger of foam fades shortly to a spotty ring of foam around edge of glass. Aroma is very sweet and malty; a vaguely citric hop presence makes itself known in the middle of the nose as the beer warms. Spices, which are also vague in the aroma, are much more prominent in the flavor: slightly nutmeggy and clovey, with cinnamon gradually coming to the fore. This balances nicely with a sweet maltiness, and more citric hop that begins early in the palate and lasts. Mouthfeel is refreshing and sort of wet (because this is a "wheat lager," according to the label?) with a slight tingle of carbonation.

It pours nicely with a off-white head to reveal a medium2dark amber color.

4.06,13.1,5,4,4,4,4,"The Sam Adams Winter Lager is a beer that I look foreward to every year and this year's version is just as good as ever. The beer is a very pretty dark amber color and looks great when held up to a light. The smell is very malty with hints of cinnamon and some other spices. The taste, unlike the Old Fez, is a much more balanced beer with less emphasis on the spice and more emphasis on the balance. There are many different layers of this beer, from the cinnamon flavors to the hint of orange this is a very complex brew. Given all the spice flavors, this is a beer I could start out on but not one I could make a session out of.","Dmann","Nov 08, 2003"

Smell is more sweet then spicy, the spice seems citric like cinnamon and nutmeg mixed with pepper and orange peels, malty sweetness subdued overall with a burnt-like caramel. Not all that strong but interesting. Taste is all over the place, layers of different spicyness, including dried peppers, cinnamon, curried apples, orange peels, did someone mix the fruit salad with the salsa? Some malty sweetness of caramel lingers in the back trying desparately to keep things in check but lets go in quite a few areas. A mild but wild ride, nothing really stands out or is overwhelming. Feel is lighter then medium with a texture that didn't fit in the carbonation for me. Seems creamy, but the smoothness is all but lost due to the carb bite it tends to have mixed with the spices. Not something I'd have again really, but wouldn't turn it down if offered. Subtle but complex, but maybe trying a little to hard to stand out.","tavernjef","Nov 07, 2003"

A nice malty, yeasty, bready aroma that increased with warmth. Full mouthfeel and a creamy sense. Alcohol noted in the flavor.

A small head with good retention, active carbonation and tight lacing rounded out the beer's appearance. A sweet malt odor dominated the smell, accompanied by a hint of hops and indeterminate spices. The same malt presence was evident in the taste, along with the complementary hops and spices. It actually tasted like the Boston Lager loaded with choice spice and maybe a little more hop presence. The medium body fit the lager style and made for a decent mouthfeel. All around, this was a very enjoyable winter lager, and an excellent representative of the Sam Adams line.","SchmichaelJ","Jan 08, 2003"

Aroma is dark, rich, sweet malt that is close to molasses, and pushing cloyingly sweet, but, fortunately doesn't get there. Superb. Taste is a very rich sweet lager with dark roast flavor. Despite the richness one is able to take big drinks and enjoy a full flavor without being overwhelmed. Not necessarily a sipping beer. Spices are subtle. Medium fullness and carbonation feel without excessiveness. Overall a very nice winter brew. Even warms up very well for a lager.","garymuchow","Jan 06, 2003"

The flavor is mildly fruity with a citric hop taste, with lots of malty sweetness and a understated (perhaps too understated) spicy character. Dry finish with a slightly sweet aftertaste, and a medium body.

Aroma is a lively blend of spices, including nutmeg and cloves, caramel and wheat malt, and perhaps some floral hops. Taste seems to indicate that the spices have been scaled back this year, to me a very good thing. The various malts roll in and down the throat, living the spices to battle it out with the hops in the aftertaste.

This is a sturdy and flavorful Winter beer to my tastes, not overblown in concept or marketing, just well-crafted and pleasant in flavor.

Mouthfeel is not quite smooth, with some carbonated bubbles, and the alcohol warms the back of the throat. I like the higher octane of this brew, and it isnt overpoweringly alcoholic in taste, but I think it might be taking over some of the flavor where some hops or spice flavor should be.

Carbonation is lots of big thick bubbles, leaving the drinker with a tingly feeling on their palate.   The body is medium/heavy, not really heavy but does have a substance to it.  This adds to its awesome mouthfeel.  Has a spicy cimmanon with a touch of cinnimanon scent to it; it is all in the tip of the nose.

4.3,19.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice amber hue with a nice white head, solid malt flavor with spicy tones, a little bit of hops finish things.  A big favorite of mine, this beer certainly makes the arrival of winter a little bit easier!","jtw5877","Nov 08, 2002"
3.7,3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Had on draught at Gameworks. Not sure if Sam is watering this down any now that they are trying to be more mainstream. Not very full-bodied, but flavorful with a nice spicy aftertaste. If I had to choose a larger-scale seasonal beer this would be it. If you can get your hands on Old Fezziwig I would try that instead and it is much more enjoyable.","Dogbrick","Nov 07, 2002"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"An attractive brew, this one pours a reddish-amber color with a bubbly, though short-lived head. Smell is big on the spices -- I sensed orange peel and other citrus, ginger and some hops. Taste was more of the same, with the central focus on spiciness. Notes of citrus were definitely detected here along with some maltiness. Mouthfeel was relatively smooth for a spice beer, and for a lager of nearly 7% ABV, this is one easy drinker. A solid, well-crafted brew that I will probably enjoy again.","Jon","Nov 06, 2002"
4.08,13.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: Spices are quite distinct, bold and adds another level of complexity to this brew, but without being overwhelming or artificial. Also has a nice warming effect that tends to sneak up on you. A pretty damn tasty winter beer.","Todd","Nov 04, 2002"
3.96,10.3,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Clear light amber. Had a steady stream of carbonation pouring through it supporting 1/2 of white foam.  Leaves a beautiful lace on the glass.  Somewhat musty aroma of with a bit of toasted malt and ginger ... aroma is pretty subdued.  Flavor begins sweet with some fresh plum flavors... finishing with grain, carmel and some ginger as well... I can barely detect cinnamon... has a slightly metallic aftertaste.  Medium to full body with a smooth mouthfeel.  Very drinkable... a fine winter warmer.","zerk","Nov 04, 2002"

4.47,24.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2002 edition. A dark amber brew with an off-white head. Head settles and leaves lace, but stays at about 1 cm, which is good enough for me. Sweet spiced aroma of caramel and ginger along with wheat and faint orange peel and hops. The spices combine with the sweetness really well and make the aroma great. Wheat dominates the flavor, making it crisp and refreshing, but alongside that is a caramel sweetness that lets you know that this is more than just a wheat beer. Cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel give a great wintery feel in the spice department. Earthy character from the wheat and the hop bite near the middle. Crisp wheat finish. Alcohol warms, again making this a great cold weather brew. A great beer to sit back with on a winter's night for a nightcap, or to pair with hearty foods at a winter feast. This review is based on my total experience from this beer, not just the sample from this year that I'm currently drinking. It does seem that this year's is not as rich as it has been in the past. However, I do still find it very enjoyable.","hyuga","Oct 20, 2002"
3.18,-11.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Note: My taste bud's have matured and my beer exploration has expanded so much, that this beer is now merely average. This year, it seemed thin, watery and not flavorful at all. Some blend of spices, but overall mostly stale nutmeg and sourness dominate this one. Spices linger. Not nearly as good as the Shipyard Winter ale, which really the only one I have to compare it too. I will leave up both sets of notes, to show how my beer tastes have developed in the past two years.","StevieW","Aug 18, 2002"

3.8,5.8,4,4,4,4,3,"Attractive ruby hue and excellent clarity.  The head is weak, but manages to leave a respectable lace.  The strong Hallertauer hop nose is followed by quite subtle and non descript spices.  Perhaps orange zest and nutmeg?  Moderate body and very slick mouthfeel. It almost has that "oily" mouthfeel that the Boston Lager has. The refined Hallertauer Mittelfruh hop flavor is quite high, but the hop bitterness is mild and thus imparts a significant sweetness to the brew.   Lots of caramelized sugars in flavor, perhaps from the prodigious use of crystal malt.  Mild nutmeg is present in flavor as well.  Winter Lager finishes sweet w/ lingering crystal malt sweentess.  Overall it's a very flavorful brew, but the sweetness borderlines on being cloying and thus hurts the drinkability.","marc77","Apr 16, 2002"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice brown color with a respectable light tan head. Faint spicy, clean aroma. Nice, slightly sweet malty taste, with just a hint of spice. Trace alcohol finish. I prefer a bit heavier brew in the winter, but on those occasions when I want something a bit lighter, this will do just fine.","mophie","Apr 04, 2002"

4.62,28.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Note: It is not called Winter Lager here in Texas. Texas Law says that beer over 5% is an ale, but since this is a lagered beer, BBC labels the Texas version Winter Brew on the bottle even though the six pack holder still says "Winter Lager". Some more of Texas' own wacky beer laws!","BeerAngel","Mar 29, 2002"
4.45,24,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Ive heard people say that Sams seasonals have been slightly off, but I think Sams getting back into their stride with the 2002/03 Winter (not that youll see much of it after January 1). Its got a deep ruby amber color, with an off white sticky head. Huge thick lace. The aroma is heavily malted, with spices and rich coffees. The taste, in this fresh batch is a little raw, with assertive malts, well balanced with spices and hops. This is a big/fast seller, and hard to get in Winter. Ive got to buy an extra twelve and forget about it because it should cellar very well. Wonderful!","jackndan","Feb 27, 2002"

Great malty sweetness offset by a unmistakable hops presense, also a hint of spice.  Absolute delightful mouthfeel, silky smooth.  Also very highly drinkable and worthy being termed a 'Winter' brew.  Almost 7%abv this one makes a cold night toasty warm.","Jordan","Dec 14, 2001"
