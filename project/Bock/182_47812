Color was a cola-brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sugary malty sweetness and I was reminded why I may not have reviewed this previously. Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery and the taste was actually not as sweet I had girded myself to expect. Instead, it had a slightly grassy hoppiness that helped to offset the malt. Finish was semi-sweet, but kind of bland for the style. I would be willing to try it again if they CAN it, but as long as it is bottle-only, it will remain a real one-and-done for me.","woodychandler","May 16, 2014"

2.42,-28.2,4,2,2,3,3,"I gave the Bock of the last two years a medium to low rating, majorily due to the fact that Yuengling has given way to the pressure to release their beer all too soon. In years gone by, the Bock wasn't released until March and ran through June, normal Bock release time. Typically a Bock is created at the end of winter and cellared until the first thaw, this gives it the distinct flavors, and causes it to mature through age. The Bock of old would release in the spring and the taste would evolve throughout the relaese. When Yuengling releases the Bock it is not ready for consumation, and it will have a very strong taste, both hoppy and roasted in taste. In my experience, the beer will maturate over a period of months, each month mellowing in flavor and revealing more complexities of the original mash tun. Although I don't agree with what Dick is doing with the release date of his Bock, I have put a few 6-packs on the shelf for, say, April and May, they will definately have a different taste by then.","Slagpile","Mar 02, 2014"

It's a very clear, chestnut colored brew, moderately low in carbonation, with a thin, whitish head. The smell is of an adjunct lager, mixed with some pleasant lightly toasted malt (identity crisis?). The taste is sweet, with some malt backbone...some macro corn-like flavors as well...more front-line bitterness than expected too. Medium in body, more than expected. This is not a great beer, but it isn't bad either. Like I said, I am a fan of throwback brews.","Suds","Feb 26, 2014"

They have a nice niche. Note - this is a lager. I praise yuengling for marketing this attempt. That said, is it a world class bock? Hell no. Did I enjoy it? Hell yes. For the price and taste I would gladly buy this every time over regular yuengling lager. That is if they keep making it.

Nice dark tea color with healthy carbonation, sweet bready malts and a lingering subtle roastiness, very light hop aroma. Nice dark bread & bittersweet flavor...more bitter from the dark malts rather than hops, a fruity note remains after taking a mouth filling sip. Decent but thin mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. Finishes up roasty-malty. Nice showing from Yuengling but some more malt backbone would elevate this to a truly high quality Bock. Good session brew nonetheless.","beerluvr","Feb 06, 2013"

3.47,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Review from notes. So there I am in the store with a 12 of Genesee Bock beer under my arm, looking for something else at the top of the food chain when I see Yuengling's Bock beer in a sixer, what, in Ohio before their porter? I took a flier on it, give Genny's lil goat a run for the $$$, Pepsi challenge style fight between the two. Poured a dark amber with little head into dimpled mug. Smells of malt and hops. Slightly bitter taste from the hops in the front that is quickly evened and sweetened up by the maltiness and then finishes rather cleanly with good mix of hop, malt and carbonation. Much like Genny a good bock that's reasonably priced, though this has a bit of hop presence to it. Much like their Black & Tan, this too seems like a bit of a mix of their lager with it's mild malt and the slight hop bite of their Lord Chesterfield Ale. Overall, very good for a decent price as far as bock goes.","Blueribbon666","Feb 16, 2012"
2.19,-35,2,3,2,1.5,2,"I am not sure if I am drinking a bad bock or a bad Yuengling lager. Not good. The goat...this is it. Outside of the inventive labeling there is nothing good going on here. I am actually very surprised they rolled this out as the first seasonal in Ohio. I would not want to buy another seasonal if I did not have a general respect for Yuengling as is. I will chalk this one up as a bad taste in an otherwise good brand. Sadly...a direct competitor to MGD.","somaohio","Feb 16, 2012"

It's a touch watery at the start, but comes through with a roasty kick at the end. Reminds me of an amped-up version of their lager in taste profile, actually. Nothing mindblowing, but perfectly serviceable and cheap. The mouthfeel is decently carbonated and has a nice dryness to it, and the drinkability is quite good.

Tastes like sweet and roasted Munich malts, some corn adjunct, and earthy hops so they used a Tettnanger or Liberty style hops good job except the corn overtone! Drinkability is high, and this is goes down easy. For all accounts and purposes this is the best in what i would call American Style Bock. It hearkens back to a German beer with an American twist.

I took my first sip and was immediately surprised; however, in an unpleasant way. WHERE IS THE TASTE? I was expecting something akin to a doppelbock, but what I got was something much less. I feel that in the world of bargain beer, Yuengling has shown through and produced a fairly good lager. Entering this tasting with that in mind was a poor idea.

Now, call me crazy, but I expected something akin to the nose (and every other bock ever brewed). Unfortunately, what hit me was some strange combination of leather and flat cola. This isn't to say that the brew was flat; indeed, it was not overly effervescent, but carried enough bubbliness to get by. Rather, it had the same flavor that a flat cola would have following about an hour in the car during some sunny July afternoon. Am I a fan? Nope.

4.23,25.5,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Taste is first of some hop bitterness followed mellow sweetness, and some slightly astringent fizzyness. Slightly too bitter for style, but highly drinkable nonetheless.","psugrad98","Feb 01, 2010"

3.5,3.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is malt. There is a little hop bite on the end, but it's not that big. If you've had a Yuengling Lager, it's like that but a little more intense malt and a little more hops.","gromis","Jan 31, 2010"

3.15,-6.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Nice coppery sort of color. Decent head that fades all to quickly. Bready aroma-somewhat nutty as well. Slight coppery/metalic tinge to it. Ok malty flavor-again a metallic presence detracts from the over all flavor. Mild caramel like flavor. Ok mouthfeel-lacks the malt body of a decent bock. Ok overall-nothing really stands out for me. Give me a regular Yuengling lager over this.","lackenhauser","Jan 30, 2010"

3.36,-0.3,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"MF&D - A little on the thin side (Watery) and lacking in any real body. Went down easy enough. Not the best, but not bad for the $6.99 price tag.","nasty15108","Aug 10, 2009"

3.03,-10.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability: Pretty average overall. Everything's a bit too mild and tone-down on overall flavor. Maybe a hoppier, thicker Yuengling in a way. I was a bit disappointed overall, as I was excited to try this and was let down a bit.","asabreed","Jul 10, 2009"

3.4,0.9,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Got this at a block party, on tap into a plastic cup. This so far has been my favorite offering by Yeungling. As in their other beers it's far from perfect but it's adeep dark brew, not much going on in the smell, but some malt, same with the taste had an odd bite to it, nothing really off or unpleasant. I like darker beers, even on a hot day and this hit the spot though. Average, not to style IMO but plenty drinkable.","srrn","Jun 01, 2009"
3.15,-6.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"I actually like the idea of Yuengling doing a seasonal selection. It's much overdue. I think this one was a bit off kilter but I think there is a good chance that improvements could be made with this one. I also like the/my idea of a possible "Festbier" from the folks at Yuengling. I believe they could capitalize on that one during the Fall season with their signature lager yeast.","weeare138","May 29, 2009"

3.41,1.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Coopers in Scranton at the front bar. Presented in a shaker "pint" glass, this bock appears a clear, rich deep chestnut color with about half an inch of creamy light tan foam. Smells and tastes of sweet caramelized malt, biscuits, and a hint of molasses and an even smaller hint of brown sugar. This beer is all about the malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. It's nice to try something new from Yuengling. I'm sure I'll be seeing plenty of this around, and that's a good thing. Especially at a place with limited choices.","ClockworkOrange","Apr 07, 2009"
3.6,6.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall- A bit light on the flavors but well balanced and definitely sessionable. I would say this is better than their lager!","NJpadreFan","Apr 06, 2009"

3.48,3.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Decent enough bock and a good, inexpensive session beer with enough flavor to warrant more than one in a single sitting. It's nice to see something other than Lager on tap at the local establishments.","ffejherb","Beers"

3.4,0.9,3,3,3.5,3,4,"D- 5.10% is low but I would only go for two before moving on. Either way it's a nice to have a alternative to the regular yuengling when your at a average run of the mill bar. There is a place for this but could use some more ABV for the style and a bigger body.","BARFLYB","Mar 16, 2009"

2.76,-18.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Frankly I'm not surprised, but this turned out to be a very bland beer. It was clean both in that there were clearly no flaws, but that the flavor profile is similar to that of water. There is a pleasant kiss of spicy hops in the aftertaste, but consider that's all my tongue could pick up, the hops are really the only taste. The beer reminds me a bit of bland "spring ales" or a watery copper ale.","tempest","Mar 09, 2009"

3.51,4.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I was able to give this brew a try last evening while at Mahars. Had a darker amber color to it with some reddish highlights, good sized head that had nice long retention and lacing. The aromas where good, they highlighted a nice roasted and caramel scent. The flavor brought this beer up a notch as I felt that the malts where better here than even the profile from the nose. Also a nice hop flavor presence is there, muted in the background but plays nicely. Overall this is a very good brew, I would have to say by far the best that I have had from Yuengling and hope that this will not just be a one and done style from them.","Stimack","Feb 27, 2009"
3.28,-2.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Had a draft at Max's Tuesday the 3rd. This was not an impressive beer. Not much of a nose and the flavor was fair with little finish. It does go down pretty easy, though. It's hard to believe that it's a blend of two decent beers, the Chesterfield and the Porter, according to Don Russell. It would seem like more Chet than Porter; maybe 2 to 1. I have the feeling that this will go better with the regular Lager crowd.","BeerIsland","Feb 27, 2009"
3.85,14.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"M + D: Moderate carbonation over a medium body... it's got a little bit of 'delayed weightiness' towards the finish. All in all, a pretyh tasty and easy going beer. I'm quite pleased with this, and have to give kudos to Yuengling. Worth checking out.","Proteus93","Feb 25, 2009"

Taste and appearance very nice just as good or better than Shiners or others of this style. Like to explore further samplings.","hopswine","Beers"
3.73,10.7,4.5,4,4,3,3,"A recommended try on a new style from an established brewer; America's oldest. Chalk this one up along with Yuengling's other under-rated styles: Black & Tan and Porter.","KFaulkner","0"
