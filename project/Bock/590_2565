Uff-da is a pretty simple bock overall but it's lack of defect and flourishing bready and nutty malt profile make it damn delicious. This beer is one of the best examples of the style you can lay lips on.","BeerFMAndy","Jul 07, 2014"

Flavors are similar, malt heavy with some maple sweetness, bitter tobacco, and nutty richness. Toasty grain, minor dried fruit notes, dates, caramel. Body is medium, and it feels somewhat full.

3.37,-11.5,4,2,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a very dark brown, a deep beautiful dark brown, with a nice 2cm head, but the bubbles are loose and falls down, leaving only a little bit of lacing. The beer is fairly clear, if you can see through the darkness. The smell is incredibly sweet and nutty, like toffee, raisins, thick heavy caramellized syrup - reminds me a bit more of like an english barleywine, or a more cleanly fermented dark belgian. I wish it was maybe a bit less on the toffee, almost buttery taste, a bit cleaner, with some real graininess - I expected more graininess, a little bit of toastiness, but I'd say that the sweetness is ok. I don't know if the grains are right in this, or maybe by experience with bocks has just been a bit confused. The taste is good. Very bready, and quite grainy, very sticky, some of the nice qualities of a bock, but still too raisiny and toffee-y for a bock, it's like a delicious blend of belgian, german, and british, to be honest, but it says right there on the bottle "Uff-Da" (which I recently learned from someone is Norwegian, so out goes the German implications there - thanks weatyweiss) with a neck label that says "Bock", should be fully german, and I don't know if it is. Maybe if some of the caramel malt was replaced with chocolate malt (and maybe some pale malt to balance out the color) this would be a bit better, though honestly I don't dislike it. The body is good, nice and thick, very sticky, with a nice light carbonation, nothing sharp, very good there. This is definitely a slow drinkier. If I step back and drink this, without knowing what style it's supposed to be, I woudl actually like it. It's like a cold-fermented belgian style to me (just think of it without quite the same yeast profile). The ABV is a little high, but I expected it. I'm going to give this a kind of higher drinkability (and some higher things because it's pretty good, it's just that it doesn't seem exactly right for a bock).","taylorhamrick","Oct 06, 2009"
3.61,-5.2,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Slightly watered down medium body with some silky chocolate malt notes and some roasted coffee notes.

3.92,2.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass the beer is dark brown red color. A decent amount of beige head dissipates rather quickly leaving no lace at all.

I taste raisins and dates. some light chocolate and a heavy alcohol esther. It slowly fades to a bready maltiness. That goes bone dry on the tongue. Medium to light body. It seems a tad thin to me.

Uff-da pours a dark amber brown that shows a ruby shade in the light. The aroma is fairly rich with caramel malt, and while there isn't a ton else going on, it's still quite pleasant. The flavor is a tad sweet around the edges, but there's enough spiciness to keep it from being cloying.

The taste follows suit: you get a clean, pleasant taste of toffee with a slight roasted coffee flavor underneath (there is no actual coffee in the beer). There's a slight acidity to the finish that doesn't quite belong, but it's not too distracting. Nothing terribly complex or challenging here, but not all beers have to be. This is a good bock: nothing more, nothing less.","chicagobeerriot","Jun 24, 2009"

There is a light foam head that is thicker around the edges. As I let it sit and made my initial notes the head actually "creamed up" where most beers the head will dissipate. There is a sweet and smooth malt attack. Faint traces of coffee are present in the finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. The finish leaves one with something of a warming sensation in the throat and belly. Very understated chocolate notes are striking the outside edges of my tongue. There is some chocolate in the aftertaste. The longer I let this beer sit the more pronounced the flavors became. I had to attend to a crying child, so that left some time. It is pretty sweet and malty compared to what I normally prefer, but I really enjoyed this.","Ragingbull","Apr 18, 2009"

Hops are just right for the style, appropriately a background note. A touch of cola creeps in, which is kind of antithetical to the apparently light carbonation.

Lower on esters than Dopples, but strong on the barley malt flavors. Mild alcohols make it easy on the head and the stomach. Finishes with a rich, rounded, attenuated malt flavor.

There was almost a floral after taste that was noticed in the smell of the beer.

Starts off with a very roasted nut flavor which is followed by taste much like caramel corn, yummy. Finishes with a nice wheat bread flavor, very unique tastes on the tongue for this brew. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Very easy to put this one down, probably one of the best bocks i've had to date. Amazing representation of this style.

The beer is a little cloudy, definitely some yeast chunks suspended in the brew. A very inviting nose to this beer, there is a moderate-high chocolate aroma, a low roasted character, and also some caramel sweetness. As expected no hop aroma. The taste of the beer has an initial moderate sweetness, more bittersweet, caramel and raisin-like. The taste quickly turns to moderate chocolate flavor with some low roasted tones. The hop bitterness is medium-low, but provides a nice balance, no hop flavor. The finish is nice as well, leaves a little chocolate on the tongue long after the swallow. The carbonation is moderate, mouthfeel is very creamy, and the beer exhibits a very full body. Overall this beer was impressive, it might be my favorite New Glarus, although favorite beer so often depends on the mood. The appearance, aroma, and taste were all top notch, as was the creamy mouthfeel.

3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Received in a mixed sixpack trade from power-trader extraordinaire, nflmvp -- many thanks for the opportunity. Poured into a Stange glass, New Glarus's stab at a Bock is a deep, dusky russett color with a modest but dense tan head which leaves substantial bands of lacing after each draught. Mellow aromas of plum juice, dark dried cherries, and brown sugar along with some earthy and spicy hops. A cherry and caramel sweetness is the most recognizable aspect of this malty brew. Some vague whisperings of leafy and spicy hops come through, but are rather less than noticeable. Thick, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel, but never sticky or cloying. Miniscule alcohol bite at the finish, which is off-dry and more or less clean. I'm not exactly an afficionado of the style, but this seems about right for a Bock. I don't normally seek these beers out, but if I were in Wisconsin on a cold evening, I just might reach for an Uff-Da. Fair enough?","orfeu","Jan 22, 2007"

Poured into my New Glarus pint glass a dark brown, almost black espresso color with a thick head that disappears after a few minutes. Swirling will bring back a thin, cappuccino looking head, with minumal lace. The smell is of dark roasted barley, coffee with noticable alcohol. The taste reveals that there were definitely dark roasted barley used in the making of this brew. The brewery actually has barley at different stages of roasting available to taste during the tour they offer. I remember tasting the darker barley from this tour when I take a sip of this beer. The alcohol is noticable, at least to my palate, with some malt and hops to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is creamy, with moderate carbonation. This could be a short session beer for me, as I continue drinking it, the alcohol takes effect and makes me wish for another. I would probably buy another six the next time I'm in Wisconsin.","evolbob","Jan 22, 2007"

The aroma is still dark fruity mlats with some added coffee and a pronounced roast as well. The taste maintains that intrigueing roasted coffee mixed with plums and other dark fruits.

Smells of chocolate and a hint of orange peel. Like one of those candies you get at Christmas. Tastes of chocolate, overroasted coffee beans, and finishes like you've just eaten a spoonful of cocoa powder. Mouthfeel is suprisingly thin for a beer with so much flavor. Doesn't satisfy the way many of its breatheren do. Drinkability is limited by that dry finish that makes you want a drink of something liquid as a chaser. An interesting brew, maybe worth a taste but not anything I will lament not being imported into my (admitedly Draconian/Machiavellian) state.","roblowther","Dec 17, 2006"

The deep color of this beer belies its equally deep flavor. The beer is extraordinarily rich and a bit malty. Its flavor is only enhanced by its complex, almost burnt smell. As indicated on its wrapper, this beer truly is best enjoyed a bit warm (around 50 degrees or so), as this only makes it sweeter and more mellow. If this beer does have a flaw, it is in its mouthfeel. For such a rich smelling and tasting beer, it seems a bit light on the tongue. On the other hand, this 'lightness' does contribute to it being a very drinkable brew.","scherbs","Dec 04, 2006"

Aroma of caramel, light toast, a touch of kringle, some walnuts and a dash of worcestshire. Rich toasted malty goodness, heavy doses of warm roasted nuts, hazlenuts and macadamias. A freshly baked portugese loaf fresh from the wood-fired oven. Rolling oats and wheat tones, with a lucious wave of brown sugar and a hint of molasses. Tart euro hops dry this brew a bit.

Under the sour is caramel and rounded chalky munich malt flavor. The aftertaste is a rich sweet toffee and cocoa/chocolate. Md-light body with a smooth feel.

Bit of malt maybe, just amazingly clean scented. Mouthfeel is strange, it feels very light, yet full at the same time. Very dry, you do not taste much, just malty. Reminds me of a brown.

The feel is right at moderate, not too thick or too thin. As far as a bock beer goes, this is not a bad choice at all.

The initial aroma I get is a cidery ester, but it went away quickly replaced by a chocolatey malt aroma. The flavor is excellent, clean malty flavor starting with chocolate and coffee and moving to a distinct nuttiness as it warms up, reminding me of pistachios. Nice body and the carbonation seems to linger even as the beer warms up. You can't even really notice the alcohol with this, I would have guessed around 6%.

Its red mahogany color looks like a cross between a red and a brown ale. It poured with almost no head though. It teneded to smell of fruit and chocalate but does not have a fruity taste.

Maybe the difference is that my bottle had been cellared a few years, but this tastes more like a microbrewed porter or a young barleywine.

Head did fade pretty fast though to a skim always present and a fairly thick ring. Smell is faint malts and light roastyness, no tang or sweetness to be found, will that carry over to the taste? Yep, kinda, its a whole lotta empty malts that renders some roastyness and seems to be quite solid and smooth but no other characteristics can be found. Hops are there in very small amount lending a bit of a grab with some roasted grains and thank goodness for that, other wise I might fall asleep drinkin this bock. Has no real finishing qualities either. Kinda bland and one dimensional. Feel is medium bodied smoothness with a small pickup near the middle.
