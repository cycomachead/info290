3.78,3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/17/2011. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, plum, chocolate, cocoa, molasses, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, biscuit, light coffee, cinnamon, herbal, light chile, clove, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, yeast ester, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, prune, chocolate, cocoa, toast, molasses, biscuit, dark bread, light coffee, cinnamon, clove, light chile, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light cinnamon/chile spice with slight heat on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, plum, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, light coffee, cinnamon, clove, light chile, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, spice, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good spiced bock style. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, spice, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

I was surprised to find that there was still decent heat especially in the aftertaste as the beer warmed. While I would have liked more heat, my problem with this beer is more the chocolate flavors that were ok, but far from the best I have had. It seems like the dark chocolate and milk chocolate do not mesh as well here as in other beers. Would love to try this one fresh, but in reading other reviews, the taste seems to hold up.","tigg924","Dec 03, 2013"

Very surprised with this beer. I’ve had some of the Imperial Series, and still don’t consider Sam Adams one of my favorites, but this one avoided the taste that seems to come with every other Sam Adams beer I’ve ever had. Not bashing on Sam Adams, either. It’s just that a few of their craft brews are not even close to standard. Overall, very good.

Aroma is a surprisingly mild. There's some light cocoa, caramel, chili pepper spice, a touch of cinnamon and some very light roast character. What's there is decent, but you have to look for it. The taste is better. There's more pepper flavor and mild but noticeable spice, and that spice blends well with the chocolate flavor. The chocolate is still just kinda sweet and boring. It's nice enough, but there are much more interesting chocolate chili beers around. Fairly clean finish. Some lingering caramel-chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It's a fine beer, but the flavors need to be refined and amped up. That said, I do think it's a big improvement on the normal SA Chocolate Bock.","popery","Sep 30, 2012"

There was a some chocolate up front, followed by brown sugar and some salt, and ending with cinnamon. I really couldn't detect much chili presence other than a faint hint, which I would have easily missed if blind tasting.

Flavor is mostly chocolate, but also has some dark fruits and cinnamon swimming around in a bock toasted malt. Finish is where the gentle warming of the chiles within shows up as a sort of indirect lip warming sensation and a tickling in the nasal passages. Texture is medium thick yet creamy.

The flavor starts with lots of milk chocolate. There are some faint spicy notes in the background. The finish is a mixture of caramel and light fruit/raisin with a slight hint of smoke. I did not taste any spicy heat initially, but about half way through the glass, I did get just a hint of a spicy burn in the back of my throat.

3.53,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Creamy mouthfeel but a medium body that seems light and falls apart over the tongue. Glad I tried it, but it could use a little more punch.","JackieTH","Nov 10, 2011"

3.08,-16.1,4,3.5,3,2,3,"Overall not impressed. Not very much chili, chocolate, or bock going on here.","zachary80","Nov 10, 2011"
3.06,-16.6,4,3,3,3,3,"O - Beer is okay. Really wouldnt buy it again, way to sweet to be a good bock.","rudzud","Nov 10, 2011"
3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours almost black with a finger tall just off white head that recedes to a thin film. Little to no lacing. Aroma is nice. Cocoa forward with a hint of caramel sweetness. Flavor is similar with A bit of chili heat which complements the coco really well. A but of sweetness. Very nice. Good carb and good mouthfeel. Very nice surprise.","Agold","Nov 09, 2011"
4.08,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This one sounded like the most promising of the new batch of SA bombers, so hopes are high right now. It pours a clear dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of cream-tan foam. Dammit, bocks are just a generally attractive-looking style, ain't they? The nose comprises cocoa, light roasted malts, very light coffee, and, with some deep sniffs (induced by the name, admittedly), some light and very mild peppers. The taste follows pretty closely, though now the pepper are a bit more pronounced: they're mostly there for flavor, with very little heat actually coming through. Imagine a very mild mole, and this would come close to that image. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a silky feel, and a finish that leans toward the dry. Overall, a very tasty brew that combines the chocolate, bock, and pepper elements very well. Good times.","TMoney2591","Nov 09, 2011"
3.55,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O - a unique tasting bock that's worth a try.","JoeyBeerBelly","Nov 09, 2011"
4.16,13.4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark mahogany, with a nice two inch sticky head, we have lacing, I repeat tons of beautiful lacing. Smell chocolate, dark fruits, burnt coffee, and a hint of spicy pepper. Taste is all that, just the slightest bit of spice in the finish. Body is big, but very approachable for the abv. Perfect carbonation. I am so surprised how much I like this beer. The only other beer with peppers I have had, was Rogues and not even close to good. Don't judge a book by the cover. Very nice brew.","SawDog505","Nov 09, 2011"
3.75,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"o - Overall a pretty nice bock. I liked the nose a lot and the chili and spice does come through in the taste as I assume they were looking for. This is the second new Sam Adams beer I've had now that has had very low carbonation, which surprised me. Worth checking out.","mdfb79","Nov 08, 2011"
4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light, huge tan head shows great retention and moderate lace. Smells mostly of chocolate and alcohol with faint hints of caramel, licorice and a faint spicy earthy tone. I would never guess form the aroma there were chili's in here. Taste is moderately malty and sweet. Lots of chocolate and caramel flavors up front. Slight melanoid and toffee type flavors midway with a warming earthy spice that lingers long into the finish. Medium to thick body, moderate level of carbonation, sweet sticky chocolate mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this brew. The chocolate is there, the bock is there, the peppers provide some nice flavors and subtle heat. Great Job Sam Adams.","johnnnniee","Nov 08, 2011"
3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O: An interesting take on their regular chocolate bock. The chilis don't come out too much, even as it warms. The chocolate is a bit subdued compared to the regular, though. A bit more mellow, even with the higher abv. I like it","BEERMILER12","Nov 08, 2011"
3.79,3.3,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 2" chocolate malt hued head with pretty good lasting power. Body is dark as coffee. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is high on cocoa, roasted malts, and coffee. I was surprised the chili was so understated. It sort of built as a subtle burn the further I got through it. All in all this is a very tasty dessert-style beer, but I guess I expected more chili since it's on the label.","MoreThanWine","Nov 08, 2011"
2.25,-38.7,3,3,2,1.5,2,"This beer reminded me of twizzlers. As soon as I poured it and even tasted it. It reminded me of the one candy that I hated. I usually like every beer I try and give it at least an average rating, but this beer just grossed me out because it reminded me of a licorice flavor. I expected a more chocolaty taste with a bigger burn at the end. I would have loved a stronger chocolate taste and more burn, but no it just gave me a sick feeling like I just ate a pack of licorice. My buddy loved it. I believe a lot of people would love it, but me myself I will never buy it again.","smxr88","Nov 07, 2011"
3.85,4.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall not bad, light but I wouldn't expect SA to go crazy as they have a huge med taste fan base.","jlindros","Nov 07, 2011"
3.78,3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Smooth and rich, very dark appearance with a thin tan laced head. Roasted malt, cocoa nibs with a sweet chocolate spicey aftertaste. There is a slight peppery warmth to it when the beer is warmed and sitting for a while. You get more of it when it is warmer rather than straight out of the cooler. A pretty unique, intriguing beer. I love anything different than the norm, and this was a decent attempt at it.","skibumma70","Nov 07, 2011"
3.3,-10.1,3,3,3.5,4,3,"Like most Sam Adams beers the taste and aroma are dead on, they're just not strong enough. I had hoped the the small batch series would be different but I guess you can't teach old brewers new tricks.","donkeyrunner","Nov 07, 2011"
3.78,3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours near-black with reddish highlights, thin cap of khaki froth, gone quickly. Scent is muted and gives off notes of cocoa powder, roasted malt, faint spice and faint dark fruit. Taste leads with a chocolate milk like taste, faint woodsy spicing and faint hint at fruit... not getting the chili. Beer is fuller side of medium body, smooth and uber dry (like sucking on a piece of lumber). Decent beer, a touch dry and lacking in complexity.","rfgetz","Nov 07, 2011"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"o - a pretty solid beer all around. i quite enjoyed this one. probably couldn't drink more than a bomber at a time though. worth seeking out in my opinion.","divineaudio","Nov 06, 2011"
3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a one-fingered light tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Black with faint ruby highlights. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light chocolate nose and flavor is almost sweet chocolate with cinnamon, no chili. $5.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma.","jdhilt","Nov 06, 2011"

3.55,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a Victory tulip with an average head, khacki in color that leaves a nice receding lacing on the glass. Dark garnet liquid with an undistinguished nose. Nice smooth mouthfeel with notes of cinnamon and bitter chocolate...the chili isn't really noticable at all. Nice bitter finish, hoppy/chocolatey. Nice but I expected just a bit more from this one.","beerluvr","Nov 04, 2011"
3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O: I was a little nervous about this beer. The label made it sound like there was a lot going on, maybe too much, but damn, this is another surprise from SA. I had their DIPA yesterday and was really impressed with that and now another one that just doesn't fit the SA blueprint. Complex and rather tasty. Smooth and drinkable.","Florida9","Nov 04, 2011"
4.37,19.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"O: I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. I liked it enough to grab a few more bottles the next day, with hopes of making it through the holidays. This is the most interesting and flavorful beer I've had from Sam Adams yet.","datalager","Nov 04, 2011"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I like it. don't love it. the 8.5% isn't detectable, which is good, but this is a "safe" chili beer. I love that they are mixing things up, and this could be great with a bit more cocoa/chili flavors to make it stand out a bit more.","silentjay","Nov 02, 2011"
