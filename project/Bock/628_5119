3.05,-7.9,3,3.5,2.75,2.75,3.25,"Bit of a letdown.  Its trying to be a Bock style of beer, IMHO despite what the label says. I believe the caramel flavor is fake, or "enhanced."The flavor dissipates across the palate nicely. Sweetness is adequate,  low end of carbonation scale, and initial mouthful is pleasing and fruity. Just not rich enough in body and not satisfying enough. Note:  I lived in Germany for about 10 years and have sampled many beers in this genre...so without trying to sound like a snob, I speak with some perspective.","LeesinkyZaika","Oct 27, 2014"

Sweet malty nose, lots of breadiness and a light whiff of caramel with a subtle hop flower backing. Bittersweet with great balance of the two. Perfectly balanced with the hops, neither dominates..makes for a smooth easy drinking Lager. Finishes long and strong, this is a great example of the style and worth looking for.","beerluvr","Sep 16, 2013"

Nose of dark bread, mild dark fruits, touch of roast, sweet malts. Taste follows, more dark bread again with the sweet malts. Light, dry and dark fruits float around as well, relatively indiscriminate. Some alcohol in the finish, but a fairly reasonable mouthfeel overall.

Cough syrup, maybe? Leaves behind a toasty, chocolatey taste. It's good overall, but there's just something odd in there. Surprised I can't taste the extra alcohol, maybe that's why the winos like it. Heavy mouthfeel, but ultimately smooth.

Bit watery in spite of the heavy sweet malt.They're definitely not brewing this for flavor or aesthetics. Might be fun to add a vinegar culture to it since it's an all malt product.

Chocolate and licorice dominate, with burnt malts and caramel coming through as well before a bitter finish with more chocolate and some hops.

Again, though, this is a great brew. Poured a mollasses brown from the green 500ml can, with a little head that only remained as a ring around the edges. Sheets of lacing that move quickly. The aroma, for me, is the best part of bocks. Ahh...malty sweetness. Some cola, mollasses, caramel, some wood smells, a little chocolate, and some prunes. Dusty, thick malts is the aroma, and I love it. Lactose, subtle cream, licorice, and red wine. I absolutely adore the aroma. The taste is a little thin, maybe a little too watery, but still flavourful. Dark malts, cola and rootbeer, with some licorice in the finish. Not overly complex, but sweet and fortifying: a great winter sipper. There is a taste of tree sap or wet wood too--somewhat hard to describe. The mouthfeel is quite light, with medium carbonation. An absence of any strong alcohol flavours and a soft mouthfeel rate this high for drinkability. Give me these all winter night. Nothing overly exciting here, but this is still a tasty beer in its category.","Cwrw","Oct 20, 2005"

Smell is almost non-existent, just a very slight maltiness. Taste is really quite pleasant, lightly hopped, nearly no bitterness to speak of. Roasted malts are quite prevalent, like a mild stout, still though, not much in the way of complexity. Perhaps some mild cherry/plum flavours, but in the background. Nice bite on the tongue, alcohol is well hidden, slides down real easy. This is really a very drinkable beer, although a bit sweeter than I usually like.","trevorwideman","Aug 06, 2005"

2.76,-16.6,3,2,3,3,3,"An enjoyable beer, but so middle-of-the-road average it hurts. I won't recommend it to anyone, but I won't turn down an offer either. A sidenote: in the Ruhrgebiet area of Germany altbier was usually suggested as served with cola. First thing I thought of when I poured this.","JustinBathurst","Sep 24, 2003"

3.37,1.8,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"A very dark brown, smooth, strong ale. A pleasant and inviting light brown head. Wonderful high quality candy smell (does that make sense?) that is very friendly (I hate candy!) and tasty. A little thin in the mouth but very comfortable and down she goes. Its hard to peg: nothing fancy but it went well with my lunch! I'd drink this again but, ya know, its almost too smooth. Got to go so I can finish this beer.","PiratePete","Jun 04, 2003"
3.24,-2.1,4.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"From a 500ml can with the freshness date stamped on the bottom. What a dark ale, a deep mahogany, decent beige head that fades to a ring with minor lacing. Smells of faint roasted hops and a fair amount of licorice. I like that, I've brewed a couple of licorice ales in my time, but have never come across a commercial equivalent. The flavour is malty and boozy, a bit of licorice, somewhat watery for the abv, but goes down easy. An average strong beer, nothing that really wows me, but drinkable nonetheless. A few of these could go down easily and lead to trouble.","IronDjinn","Jan 24, 2003"

2.33,-29.6,3.5,3,2,2,2,"I don't really taste the 7% alcohol which is good however I probably need to partake more in this style of beer to develop a taste and appreciation for it.","SaunaKing","Nov 21, 2002"
3.88,17.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I'm a fan of the bock concept with the Doppelbocks (Aventinus and Celebrator) clearly leading the ways in my book, but with the price of those at 2-4 times higher, Holsten's is a nice alternative when you've already got the important money wrapped up in the "premium" brews.","49degrees","Jul 29, 2002"
3.31,0,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This beer was a major surprize in a positive way. The appearance when poured left a lot to be desired. The appearance seemed heavy and syrupy. But it was not...the body was full with a glass clinging light foam. The taste is well balanced with an almost almond flavour. Mouthfeel as well was above average.","Shiloh","Beers"
4.39,32.6,3,4,5,4.5,4,"An impressive brew.  not sure if I got the right style.   It's a strong dark german ale.  Not too heavy or thick, with a strong nutty taste  The alcohol content, though high, was well masked and I was actually quite surprised when I noticed it on the can.  The drinkability I had to downgrade because of the morning after, to rub that in I had 24 hour train ride.  I quite liked the taste however, and if the circumstances of my first experience were better, I would be  sure to make this a regular of mine.","the42ndtourist","0"
