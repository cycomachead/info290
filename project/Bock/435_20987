I also thought it was strange that this beer was made in Wisconsin.This beer doesn’t represent the USA well. It is not much of a bock the flavor doesn’t finish like one. It has a very basic aroma that is a lot like an American adjunct lager. The body is medium with an average amount of bite. There is a small amount of bitterness and carapils sweetness.","MTNboy","Jan 16, 2012"

Pours with a 1-finger head, reduces to nothing, lacing is average, color is clear caramel-brown. Aroma of dark malts, caramel, some wet leather. Taste can be described the same. Slight sting on the palate, sweet malty aftertaste. Nothing special, yet highly drinkable for a dark (watery) session beer.","ToAzwethinkweizm","Feb 18, 2010"

It has a watery light bodied mouthfeel.","Brettster","Jan 05, 2010"

Sure doesn't taste like any bock I've ever had, and the fruity esters make me think this was either brewed with an ale yeast or at too high a temp. In the end it doesn't matter. It's simply bad, uninspired beer.","number1bum","Dec 20, 2009"

Aroma of caramelized malt, a bit of cooked vegetables, and no hops to speak of. Aroma was rather weak overall. Taste was also a bit bland. Very clean and crisp, but I attribute that to the lack of taste in the first place. I did find some sweetness and some metallic tones though. Probably won't want this again.","DmanGTR","Apr 18, 2009"

2.41,-17.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,2,"From the Beers of America 18 ct variety pack, this one pours a decent looking copper, not a bad start, but nothing exceptional either. It's got an off-white head initially, but this quickly dissipates. The nose is pretty mild, primarily malt, but no discernible hops, which I found unusual. The flavor turned out to be like the nose, primarily malt, a bit sweet and some nuttiness, but again, little to no hop flavor. Mouthfeel wasn't so hot - it's pretty thin like the rest of the beers in the pack, other than the porter. Drinkability isn't bad, considering its relative blandness, but I think Beer Advocates hold their brews to a higher standard and shouldn't accept something this generic. This one was pretty damn mediocre, much like the rest of the Beers of America. Don't waste your time.","JWFokker","Dec 26, 2007"

3.16,8.2,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Taste starts with plum and apricot ripe fruits and moves into a chocolately caramel bock malt that gives way to a really pleasant spicy, smokey ending. Solid, but it lacks the chocoately sweet high or spice complexity of a great bock.","mynie","Apr 16, 2006"

Nice malt flavor, balanced on the malty side with enough hops that it isn't too sweet. Tastes more along the lines of an Octoberfest than a Bock. My guess is this beer has been "dummed" down and kept lighter bodied for the masses. Not a bad beer, but it isn't a bock.","schoolcb","Mar 07, 2006"

3.53,20.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours deep mahogany color color with a modest light cream colored head over top that is maintained by a nice cascade of bubbles. Nose is sweet caramel with a light roasted malt background, but mostly just sweet caramel. Flavor is a decent balance between the sweetness from caramel malts and a lighter touch of roastyness to give it an almost toasty character. Feel is a rather full moderate with a solid carbonation. A pretty easy drinking beer overall. There is just something about this beer that does not sit well with me. The sweetness almost seems chemical, like its fake.

3.37,15.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Taste: Exceedingly creamy, each sip seems like it's bursting into foam. Feels heavy in the mouth, yet a bit dry.

It has a smooth, malty flavor that is light and easy drinking. It goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation.
