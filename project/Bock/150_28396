3.08,-17.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"deep russet brown, with no head anda very minimal lace, decent carbonation was evident. Smell was grainey with a slighlty off fruit aroma in the back anda hint at some bitterness. The taste intresting,albeit not very comple x at all. Sort of a glammed up amber. Lots of malt with a slight bittering hops presence and a hint at maybe something fruity in the back? If its there it is very faint. Overall I cannot say it is horrible as I have had much much worse beer","mikesgroove","Sep 18, 2011"
3.13,-16.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"This poured out as a pretty nice looking brown color. The head wasn't too bad either. The smell of the beer had a nice malt character to it, the taste followed behind pretty closely with the malts giving off a sweet flavor. The mouthfeel was almost medium. A little light for this style. Overall it's a decent brew but not the best.","Knapp85","Jun 10, 2011"
4.07,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - Overall, I think this is a very solid representation of the style. I could easily quaff a sixer of this in a night. I'm very glad I got a chance to try this brew.","drizzam","Sep 29, 2010"
3.38,-9.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"M/D - nice carbonation and mild flavor, smooth and creamy mouthfeel, a decent bock but nothing to seek out","mikereaser","Jun 29, 2010"

3.95,5.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Quite high -- nice smells and solid flavors, it feels like a moderate ABV and the price was right, so I would definitely grab this again.","bamadog","Dec 26, 2009"
3.47,-7.2,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Average to above average lower priced bock. Will satisfy someone looking for an uncomplicated non-hop-centric drink.","fightingwords","Nov 12, 2009"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"After having reviewed three less-than-stellar beers from Lion Brewery, I couldn't be more surprised that Stegmaier Brewhouse Bock is as good as it is. Since bocks are among my least favorite styles, that ought to count for something.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 07, 2009"
3.38,-9.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Easy drinking and quite good for a session. This is a great beer for washing down a couple slices of pizza. I would order this again in the Philly area...","ILikeGoodCider","Jun 22, 2009"
3.45,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a lighter amber color with a very thin head even with a moderately aggressive pour. There was no lacing and carbonation seemed light for the style. The aroma is of sweet bread, with dry fruit (raisins, plums), and some spice. The taste is dry with the fruitiness in the aroma coming through. Not much to my liking and not that strong for the style. I am not a huge bock fan to begin with but I respect a good brew. This was a little below my expectations.","WJVII","Jun 03, 2009"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D: Goes down easy!","kevman527","Jun 02, 2009"
3.7,-1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D: A very good brew. I'm upset with myself that I never bought this when I was in college, only about a mile away from the brewery itself. I'll have to make a road trip I think.","MLasoski","May 30, 2009"
2.9,-22.5,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"I will try this beer again, because I might not have been in the mood for it, but I'm not a big fan of this red beer with a good foamy head.","Amalak","May 13, 2009"
4.24,13.4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured with little head, a thin film on the top. Color is a clear copper color. Smell is a little roasty and sweet. Carbonation makes for a crisp taste. Very refreshing and I imagine would be nice on a hot day. A little bit of banana sweetness, plus a standard bock maltiness. I enjoyed this enough to want to buy a good deal more.","dborginis","May 10, 2009"
3.53,-5.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"There isn't anything noticeably wrong or especially good about this one. A mild hop presence to balance the malt could improve this one in several areas.","meatyard","May 01, 2009"
3.2,-14.4,4,4,2,4,4,"Very light in flavor and rather bitter for a bock. Maybe I'm used to doppelbocks. I don't love it, nor do I want more, but it is very drinkable.","emsroth","Apr 29, 2009"
3.15,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"D - Respectable Bock offering, but doesn't standout memorable in any particular category...","philbe311","Apr 28, 2009"
3.93,5.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Picked up a single bottle at the Beer Stop for around $1.50. Poured into my shaker glass. Appears a clear chestnut color with about an inch of creamy ecru foam. Minimal lacing sticks to the inside of the glass as I make my way to the bottom. A nice looking pour. Smells and tastes of caramelized malts, lightly toasted grains, sweet biscuits, a touch of molasses, great sweet malty flavor. Creamy and smooth and about a notch above medium in body with medium carbonation. I'm going back for a sixer. This went down way too easy on this chilly early spring evening. A great beer for the money as well.","ClockworkOrange","Apr 11, 2009"
3.65,-2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer went well with my spicy pizza.","tmoneyba","Apr 02, 2009"
4.57,22.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured a deep amber into an Imperial pint glass. Nice malty nose reminiscent of an old world bock or märzen style beer. Goes down smooth, and leaves an aftertaste that makes you want to crack open another. Found this for 5.99 a sixer at the Anderson's in Toledo, OH, and at that price, you can't beat it. You can spend a couple bucks more for less flavor from some breweries that do more marketing and distribute more widely. Great quality from a regional brewer that isn't known for its craft beers.","PABeerFan","Mar 31, 2009"
3.89,4,3,4,4,3.5,4,"In the end, this a great sweet roasted Bock beer. One of the better Bock beers I've had lately. Another plus about this beer is the low price this beer has. I'm not sure what you paid for a case of it, but I only paid $8 a case. If the price was raised, would I buy it again? More than likely I would buy it again.","AltBock","Feb 03, 2009"
3.75,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D- Very drinkable","beckje01","Nov 23, 2008"
3.64,-2.7,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Bock of a reddish copper color with a thin white head and faint lace. The aroma is malty with citrus hops, a kind of a winelike character. It is thick bodied with candied malt taste notable and a bitter grassy hop kiss. A bit dry and quite sweet with good carbonation throughout. Midland drinkable but overall quite a solid bock that I would like to sample again to get a better grasp of the sharp character here.","Durge","Apr 06, 2008"
4.05,8.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Very easy to drink and bicely refreshing. Good middle-of-the-road beer.","tgbljb","Mar 10, 2008"
2.56,-31.6,4,3,2.5,2,2,"Last swigs: This one falls short of the mark. Kind of a messy interpretation with too much flavor play that sways off the tight guidelines.","blitheringidiot","Feb 22, 2008"

3.53,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: As I may have mentioned before, the beer is quite smooth and doesn't have anything bad in particular. It just doesn't stand out either though.","drseamus","Aug 08, 2007"
4.2,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a rich amber hue with a nice two finger light khaki colored head that takes a few minutes to die down to a nice full lacing that lasts throughout. Stickiness is good for this style. Smell is a sugary sweet caramel malt with a bit of bready malt as well, nothing more...nothing less. Taste is much of the same, starts with a sugary sweet caramel malt mixed with a bit of mild chocolate taste, very enjoyable. Surprisingly this one ends a bit dry, but in a very balanced way. Mouthfeel is slick with a fair amount of carbonation. Wow, I could easily put a few of these down in a sitting. Thanks again to Josh for this all around quality made brew.","BeerTruth","Jul 07, 2007"
4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Lion brewing is really producing some fantastic seasonals of late and they are incredibly priced. They are perfect beers for mass consumption (aka when the family or friends come over) because they're just as cheap as BMC but they are just as good as many very respectable micros! Keep up the great work!","number1bum","May 27, 2007"
4.68,25.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability was exceptional as I was done with this baby before I knew it. Exceptional beer, especially when you consider the price. Nice job Lion Brewery/Stegmaier.","malbug","May 01, 2007"

3.61,-3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Easy drinking and very sessionable lager. This is a great beer too wash down a couple slices of pizza or a plate of wings. At less than $16 a case, you cant go wrong.","DGryger","Mar 04, 2007"

4.29,14.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I saw a case of this at the distributor for 12.99 so I had to buy it. The beer poured a dark brown with hints of orange and a small off white head. Big toasted malt nose, it smells very rich and malty. The taste is very impressive. The toasty malt dominates with a hint of grassy bitterness and a little caramel sweetness. It has a medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. I was very impressed by this beer. When I was growing up in NE PA the Stegmaier brand was crap, it was a real awful beer. It is great to see the brand taken back its German roots and brewing style.","orsulacp","Oct 18, 2006"

3.02,-19.3,2.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Wasn't really sure what to expect with this one. Poured an amber / red colour crystal clear. Had a snow white, loosely knit large bubble head that totally went way in about 90 seconds. Doesn't really look very exciting, to me. Looks like a glass of tea, actually. Smell is quite muted. What I can smell, is faint, sweet malts, and a touch of yeast it seems. Taste is decent. You could do much worse. There are quite a bit of sweet malts present here; perhaps a touch of hops hiding in the back. Mouthfeel is fair with moderate carbonation. Nothing special here, at all. Glad I got to try it though.","SilentSabre","Aug 16, 2006"
3.48,-7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pretty thin bodied, and the taste was somewhat thin too, but I may be getting spoiled with the imperial versions of brews. This still was a good session brew for a lazy afternoon, thanks to beerbeing!","Vancer","Jun 26, 2006"
3.38,-9.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"thank goes to LeopoldStoch for this bottle. poured a meduim dark amber, with a small ring of off white foam.. aroma, got a strange sourness, than some brown sugar and malt and a whiff of alcohol. flavor, didnt get any of the sourness, sweet maltness, honey. a little on the thin side but it was easy to drink not to bad.","walleye","May 31, 2006"
3.85,2.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"On tap at the Grey Lodge in NE Philly. This beer poured a clearish brown color with a thin white head that didn't last very long. The aroma is a bit toasted malts and a bit floral hops. The taste has a good tongue of toasted malts, a bit sweet with some hop bitterness that is enjoyable. Overall this beer is very drinkable and pretty complex. Another fine beer from Steg which is great to see being from NEPA originally.","ggaughan","Mar 29, 2006"
4.42,18.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"At this price, you'd be a sucker not to get it. It's easy drinking, but full of flavor.","monkeybutler","Mar 21, 2006"

4.03,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"If someone told me this is the only bock I could ever have, I'd not be too terribly disappointedor at all, for that matter. It's simple and very tasty, and while complex is alright at times, stripping down to the nuts and bolts can come across wonderfully as well. It's very drinkable, for the lack of excess effort the palate has to make to enjoy it. There will be more of this in my future.","Foxman","Mar 07, 2006"
4.27,14.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"If you enjoy a bock beer you should have a session with this new brew made from an age old recipe by the Lion Brewery.","Walsar","Mar 06, 2006"
4.02,7.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Tried a case of this for something different as it is something newer on the market. What a pleasant surprise for something that was less than $18 bucks. Served in a 12 oz. bottle, poured dark amber with a creamy colored head that stayed to visit for a bit. First smell was a wonderful toasted carmel malt. First sip was bitter,but pleasant,closely smoothing out to the roasted malt, sweet and creamy heavy aftertaste. A great beer made better served a tad bit warmer than the fridge. Can't say what the alcohol content is, but not to heavy. Great for a cold night but not an all night beer. Seems to fill you up quite quickly. Overall, great craft beer for an even better price. I might have to get this again.","katdaddy210","Mar 01, 2006"
4.43,18.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability: A nice example of the style, balanced well, proving that you can still have a nice, flavorful beer, without going overboard, one direction or another.","TastyTaste","Feb 25, 2006"
4.05,8.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D- Pretty damn impressive, its lovely to run into a tasty bock like this ... especially in the growing and evolving craft beer world. I could drink this through the night.","Jason","Feb 17, 2006"
