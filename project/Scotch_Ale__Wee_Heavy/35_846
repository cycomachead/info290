4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Samuel Adams doesn't just provide a superficial glimpse of the scotch ale style as many brewers do, they provide you with a bona fide example that is indistinguishable from the immemorial ales of Scotland.

3.73,-0.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a pretty solid looking, one finger creamy head that is sticking around pretty well and is giving good lacing. The body is dark dark red with a fair amount of brown in it, lots of carbonation, maybe too much, we will see. Overall this looks really good, the head is very impressive, if it weren't for the carbonation this would look perfect. It for sure smells like a scotch ale, deep malt smell with a molasses/maple syrup smell. It smells solid, doesn't smell like there is much wrong with it, does it smell amazing? No, but good. The flavor on this is a little disappointing, it's not a bad flavor or anything, just really boring. It's very smooth, and easy drinking, and even a little creamy, but it's just not that complex and it's lacking in flavor. You get that molasses/maple syrup taste and that deep malt taste, but the flavors are just dumbed down a bit all around. There isn't really anything wrong with it, no offensive flavors or anything, it's just boring, not complex and not enough flavor, it's that simple. The carbonation is better than I though it would be, not too much, and the body overall is pretty good for the style. The drinkability is decent, kinda a toss up between it not having enough good flavor, but at the same time being light because of that lack of flavor. Overall it's a good beer, just very average in the creativity category and flavor category.","MaltsOfGlory","May 11, 2011"

The taste is decent, this beer is big on malts and doesn't have a whole lot of hops in it. It's mostly a slightly roasted sweet earthy brew. It's interesting.

The smell is very similar to Boston Lager, so much so that it bothers me a little. As far as mouthfeel goes, it's fairly thin, not too much, but not really thick either. Overall I like it.

This was purchased out of a sample pack and I'd never buy this on it's own, especially not now. It has some characteristics of scotch ales, but is not as impressive as the standard bearers of the style.

The smell is strongly malty in nature, but there are nice hints of cinnamon and strong caramel notes. The taste is pretty standard for the style, but that doesn't mean it's not good. I rather enjoyed the caramel flavoring with an almost nutty background flavor. The mouthfeel was a little thin for the style, I expect a more syrupy body.

This may have been one of the better brews I have had of Sam Adams, a claim that grows more definitive by the day.

In the mouth it's the caramel that comes out first, with a medium but somewhat cloying feel carrying down the slight smoke later on.

The taste does better, bringing in some toffee, some minor pine, some mild coffee, a tinge of dark chocolate, and an allusion to light orange peel. A light haze of peat smoke hovers over the proceedings. The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel.

I find the smoke flavors very authentic and the malt backbone thick and viscous yet not overbarring.

The beer has that characteristic peat/dirt taste of the funky scotch malts, slightly phenolic, and vaguely astringent tasting too, all by products of this malt. Don't get me wrong, the beer still smells and tastes very clean, almost lager-like in some ways. It sounds like this beer is sort of a mess, but in reality is a nicely balanced, rich and flavorful, slightly smokey beer. I bet this beer would be killer with some good BBQ ribs or even some chicken.

Sucks that you have to buy the lame Brewmasters collection to try it.

The beer produces a mega foamy head with generous amounts of lacing to it. The nose is good, extremely malty and sweet smelling. Smells of caramel with after-notes of toffee and a hint of smokeyness. The taste is good. A very malty brew, you can really taste the caramel and chocolate malts as well as malted barley. Slight smokeyness again (from what I gather is the Peat Malts) in the flavor followed only by a slight taste of the hops, but not very strong, hopes are more noticeable in the mouthfeel than the taste. The back of the bottle sums it up the best in two words "Sweet & Smokey." The mouthfeel is truely exceptional. For a beer with so many different malts, it has a well balanced smooth and creamy feel with just enough of a bitter finish. Not too heavy, not too light truly remarkable.

Malty aroma, notes of caramel and sugary sweetness, plus the added bonus of well-balanced peat and smoke character. I certainly didn't expect that! Low bitterness with caramel and malt sweetness that didn't end up cloying. Peat was more subdued in the flavour, but made its presence known in the finish. Medium bodied with decent texture, average carbonation. Easy drinking for a beer with some peat character.

Taste follows with a simple sweetness and a moderate carbonation level. Light in flavor, light in ABV yet a bit too syrupy.

Definitely pick up on the smoke/peat flavors, not too powerful but noticable. Some tea like hop bitterness in the end. The feel is moderate, a little chewy but is cut by the active carbonation, finishes with a slightly dry/astringent bitterness. Perhaps a touch thin for the style.

Luscious off-white head was barely contained in the glass (went from the stripe surrounding the bowl up to the lip of the glass) leaving behind lots sticky white lacing. Good head retention eventually dissipated into a thin consistent layer of foam. Fair amount of lacing with decent adhesion during the tasting. Lots of sweet malt (perhaps a hint of caramel) in the nose as well as a subtle smoky quality. Flavors are consistent with the nose; however, sweetness is less pronounced and a nice earthy-peaty flavor at the finish.

It smells of sweet chocolate maltiness and a bit of grassy hops. The taste hits hard with smoked flavor and roasted, grainy chocolate. This is followed by a bit of bitterness and astringency. I think I also detected some alcohol flavor in there. The mouthfeel is very nice and full-bodied.

A fair bit of bitter hops melding with oddly not-sweet roasted malt. Really not a very good flavor. Feel is solid, no complaints. Overall though, the flavor just didn't do it for me.

A bit of toffee and caramel flavor comes through, but not as much as there should be. The finish is dry and exudes that spicy, smoky peat character.

Poured one into a pint glass and it had very little head, natch, and a dark mahogany color with small lace patches left on glass. This label doesnt say triple malt like the picture on this site, but they are there. Smell is rather malty, with some caramel picked up  I didnt pick up much else. You can taste the roasted malt immediately, and it gives this rather full-bodied ale (it doesnt look like a traditional heavy ale) a mildly dry backbite. I think the malts overpower this ale a tad, but you can still pick up some earthy tones. I dont know; I cant put my finger on it but this is one of those instances where I am not thoroughly impressed w/ a beer, yet I cant really find anything negative to point out.

The fruity notes are absent from the taste, and the smokiness comes through distinctly, but not unbalanced. Bitters are very low and more of a bite comes from medium levels of carbonation.

In the mouth are flavors of well-roasted malts, beechwood smoke, and sweet malts. Perhaps lacking the foundation and body of some of the top notch Scotch Ales, this version makes up for this departure by providing us with uber drinkability and a very enticing flavor profile from this original Scotch Rauchbier Ale.

Other flavors I picked up were of smoky peat, caramel, and brownies. Mouthfeel is light as far as I can tell for the style.

After a few minutes you start to smell and taste some butterscotch which eventually becomes a prominent flavor. Very nice. A nice carbonation. Went down real easy for a heavy-ish beer.

On the palate, there's a sharp twang of bitterness first off, then a sweet, smoky, oaky warmness at the center. The finish dries out a bit as those earthy hop tastes return. Medium bodied, not very thick for the style, with pretty understated carbonation. Overall, this is only OK. IMO, it's too smoky; I would have preferred a bit of fruity and nutty complexity.

3.75,0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Served in a bulb. A medium pour produces a two-fingered tan head, which collapses into a rocky formation in a few minutes. Lacing is quite good, adhering very firmly to the surface of the glass in a lattice-like formation. Dark garnet in color, and brilliant to the eye. The nose is very compelling, with notes of peat-smoked malts dominating tangy dark malts and sweet, biscuity pale malts. Bright and lively on the first sip, with a pleasant roundness to the malt profile coming to the fore. Finish is actually compelling as well, beginning with lingering biscuit notes before giving way to a partway tangy, partway peaty finish. There's a nice touch of oily, viscousity here, too. Fruity and a bit boozy at one moment, yet hardly sweet; tangy, light, almost crisp. Notes of ripe dark fruits and berries, particularly those that balance sweet with tart (cranberry). A little bit buttery, with a bit more alcohol in the aromatics. Hop bitterness is very well defined, yet works in tandem with the carefully blended malt profile (besides, has anyone heard of a hoppy Scotch Ale?) This may be a bit lighter than I prefer for the style, but no doubt this was formulated with an appeal to the more casual drinker than Scotch loyalists. Either way, there's no missed-step in the execution of the style. Perhaps a bit too smokey for some, it works for me. A fine rendition overall.","Chaz","Mar 01, 2007"

The brew is fairly clear and there is a lack of visible carbonation in it. I like how this one sits in the glass. The nose is caramel, a little buttery, and light with peaty smoke. The butteryness seems to dominate a bit and is not what I really wanted to find. Taking a sip, I find a more pronounced peaty smoke than the nose would tell me. The caramel is really nice behind that, adding a mild sweetness and a very good malt base. The butteryness is not present in the flavor, which really helps pull this one together for me. There is just a hint of a mild hop bitterness that fills out the finish of this one. It is enjoyable. The mouthfeel is moderate with a lightish to moderate carbonation. Overall, I like this one.

No don't get me worng, I love the malty aspect of beers, but this ends up being a little too much. Lots of smoke and bark root. I think what's missing is the heavy ABV that I accustomed too witht this style. Witht the low ABV, it ends up being quite drinkable.

3.57,-4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Longneck into a standard pint. Produced a 1/2 inch light tan head and was deep red in color. Took a while for the head to fade, and it did leave some lacing. Aroma was dominated by malt with some caramel sweetness and a scotch or whisky-like smell. Taste was very malty and caramelly-sweet up front with some light roast. This was balanced by a nice, earthy hop presence, and finished peaty with a whisky feel. A medium-bodied brew with moderate carbonation and a slight alcohol warming. This malt-bolstered brew is heavy and complex, and it is probably better in smaller amounts or as the end of a session. One is enough for me.","kkosmoski","Jan 24, 2007"

Does not clobber you with malty sweetness and peatyness like many Scotch Ales do. It's fairly well-balanced and rich. Creamy mouthfeel which is enhanced by the carbonation in this beer.

Average at best. Smell was a bit weak. "Malt" is about all I get from this. Taste, too, leaves alot to be desired. There is a grain / malt presence, and a touch of bitterness, but as far as any really noticeable flavour profiles, they simply aren't there. Not impressed. Mouthfeel is fair and the overall drinkability or "functionality" of this ale is decent. It is not a bad beer. In fact, I would likely drink this again. Especially with food.

Thinking I might have got a bad batch I've bought two more of these very mediocre twelve packs within the past two weeks. I don't think I've just bought three bad batches. This beer lacks the zing it once had. The qualities that I once admired, the delicate balance of smoke and malty sweetness, have either been carelessly overdone or removed from the formula. In there place is an unimpressive tanginess and a confused jumble of flavors. Obviously Sam Adams is going for quantity over quality. I just wish they'd give this new ale a new name because it is not the Sam Adams Scotch Ale that I had grown so fond of.

Finally found some in a brewaster 12 pack at Green's in Columbia, SC. Alas, I was a little disapointed. Poured a deep rich ruby red with an off white head. Smell of dark chocolate and caramel malts with just a hint of the peat smoked malt that I remember. Maybe my taste buds have matured or they have changed the recipe, but I did not sense as much of the peat smoked malt as before. A very satifying brew, just not as good as I remember.","clemtig76","Jun 19, 2005"

Sweetened malts start out and gives away to a caramel, smoky peat flavor. Some hpos do show up, but just add to the variety of flavors that are already in here. Mouthfeel was a little weak I thought.

That hits you up front, and then fades to the sweeter candy butterscotch tones hinted at in the smell. Nice toffee malts.

For appearance, Scotch Ale pours out in a deep red colour, with little head. The bottle label uses a tartan design. I didn't smell much of an odor upon opening the bottle. After I poured it into a glass, I detected a smoky odor. The taste was really strong at first. It was very smoky, and I felt it immediately on my tongue. On the label, Jim Koch describes it as a "subtle smoky flavor." There was nothing subtle about it! After a few sips, I began to fully enjoy the drink.

Maybe a hint of hops as well. Taste is malty with some strong smokey peat notes with a nice dry finish with a decent amount of bitterness. The dry finish makes this beer very drinkable.

The head was fairly thick and stood around for the whole drink. The smell was like most Scotch ales, but had a bit more body in the malt area. It says that whickey malt is used in it, and I can detect it in the smell. The taste had a small hint of whiskey malt to it, I thought, but had a creamy sweetness to it as well. The only thing that was a "let down" to the beer was that it wasn't really thick in the taste, like most are. Don't get me wrong though, it was still really friggin awesome.

Laces in rings and latter, small dots. Good smell, caramel and Twix Bar chocolate mingling. Body is medium, slightly lighter than I remember it. The flavor is entirely pleasant, beginning with obvious malt tones. The balance is good for a beer, astringent hoppiness finishes the impression -- a little more like an ESB.

The head is foamy and light beige in color, about a half finger in height. It fades to big soapy bubbles; there was some spotty lacing as the beer was quaffed. The nose had a modest aroma, strength-wise, the bouquet expressed hints of chocolate malts that are lightly toasted with a whisper of smoky-caramel at the end. There is something mysterious about the aroma, the invitation is frank, and I gladly took a sip. The mystery is solved, the palate is well developed with chocolate malts upfront, slightly dry, a note of earthy, herbal, spicy hops are found in the middle plus a vague smooch of sweetness and the finish is smoky, dry, chalky, with a hint of toasted malts, wood, and peat. This is far drier than I expected and the maltiness is not as big or as sweet then Id prefer. But the subtle complexity of this Scotch Ale cannot be ignored. Medium in body, a bit less bulk than there should be, low carbonation; the mouthfeel is slick and thinned by a lack of malt. This aspect of the beer is ordinary at best. This is a plenty tasty beer, Id recommend you find this dandy, pop the cap, pour, enjoy.","bditty187","Jan 19, 2004"

3.6,-3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Deep amber/copper with reddish tints; and a nice creamy head that dissipates quickly leaving only a thin collar of foam. Minimal, and 'slightly touched-by-roast' malt aroma, as expected for style. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Smooth, malty flavor showing an edge of peat smokiness and a touch of English hop bitterness. Well balanced. Finishes with a malty sweetness and light bitterness. Very smooth and drinkable. An excellent example of a full Scottish ale! Scotch ale as beer afficianados see it? Hmmm? However, nicely done.","NeroFiddled","Aug 12, 2002"
