Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with very sweet malt and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that smells pretty nice but the taste is way too sweet to drink a lot of this one.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 24, 2013"

Nah, that’s being mean, substitute the Social Security office there, those chicks at least feign smiles at times.

3.53,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Fruitiness continues in the flavor and combines with a brown bread yeastiness that makes this very un-Scotch Ale-esque. There does seem to be plenty of caramel and even a touch of peat in here but is overshadowed by the yeast presence. I want mad smoke, peat, chocolate and sugar flavors in my Wee Heavy. This delivers on the carmely/sugar aspect, but fails on the other three. Mouthfeel is good, the carbonation fine and the beer slick. Unfortunately, the beer seems to fall short of the richness and malt complexity a good BSDA comes with and does not fare well against other great Scotch Ales due to the lack of smoke/peat/chocolate. Its not bad, I mean...I wont have trouble finishing this 750, but certainly not something I would come back to again for the price.","twiggamortis420","Feb 23, 2013"

3.82,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a dark, vibrant ruby coloring that is hazy, giving it a bloody quality. The head starts out a foamy, rising, light tan color that is almost an inch, but quickly settles into a sparse covering film. Aromas are extremely sweet and boozey, with a strong nut character, as well as a roast and scotch backbone. The nose is very forward and strong, tipping it's hand towards a stronger flavor profile. Initial taste does not disappoint, with a blast of rich and deep flavors. More roasted than the aromas depicted, the nut and caramel malts remain strong, with a more subdued alcohol characteristic. Smooth bodied, and surprisingly not cloying, the beer is an easy drinker. The aftertaste is rich and sweet, with a hazelnut flavor, and the finish is quick, despite the full body. A slight tang of booze on the very end of the palate. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 20, 2011"

It gives off a malty Moxie and maple sugar smell with lemony accents. I like it. The flavor says thick vanilla and candy apple with Dr. Pepper ideas and a little whiskey to boot! It's a medium-plus bodied brew, near syrupy but fair carbonation makes it plenty drinkable considering the ABV. Very enjoyable.","Durge","Dec 02, 2011"

The flavor is pretty sweet in typical scottish fashion but there is a distinct belgian feel to it in terms of the malt profile. Not bad at all but perhaps a bit sweet for me.

The palate, though, is a different story, and the Belgian elements and the Scottish influence come into focus here. Some acidity first off and some brisk carbonation, followed by some rich, chocolatey and nutty malts combined with dark fruit esters. The finish turns sweet and shows some bubblegum and tropical fruit notes. Overall, this is a successful hybrid of Belgian and Scottish. It's interesting, tasty, and cohesive.

Flavors though bold, become too muddled. The peated malt doesn't really jive with the Belgian spicy yeast. The beer seems to get it's sweetness and texture from the Belgian candy sugars rather than from caramelly malt--this hurts the Scotch Ale character. The spiciness and fruitiness detracts from the syrup sweetness. The moderate body seemed a bit thin, but still nice. The alcohols are nicely hidden--only a light detection in the finish.

3.83,3.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours nice dark mahogany with a decent head that goes away. Can't pick up much in the nose except some malt. But it smells fresh that is a plus. Taste is nearly all malt. A little caramel. Little drier mouthfeel than I like. Very enjoyable.","daledeee","Oct 06, 2003"
4.42,19.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"It gets an almost sticky, cloying sweetness that stops just short of being over the top. Outstanding for a dessert beer or night cap and a nice belly-warmer. I really liked this beer!","rkhaze","Sep 28, 2003"
4.18,12.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Just between thin and moderate mouthfeel, this is a soft and even beer. Not subtle  its far from quiet  but instead calm and easy, not big or aggressive flavors. Smoothly sturdy and quietly confident, it comes off as a nice belgian turn on a Scottish jewel. In other words, very much soft, complex, and leveled like a Belgian artisanal.","nomad","Sep 20, 2003"
4.11,10.8,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Tastes of strong caramel. Oak flavors like you would taste in aged port. Very nutty with a molasses finish. Big, full-bodied beer. Very nice Scotch ale.","ViveLaChouffe","Aug 13, 2003"
3.7,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium brown color. Large head. Aroma is malty and a little fruity. Full-bodied Scotch Ale. Malts are bold, but a little too sweet. Very fruity tasting. Flavors are molasses, chocolate, cherries, peat and smoke. Very smooth taste. Nice beer, its just a touch too sweet, but there is a slight bitterness at the finish to balance it out. It hides the 8% alcohol well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jun 24, 2003"
3.67,-1.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer has pleasant malty smell that becomes more distinctively caramel. . Earthy  and you can really smell the alcohol. The color is a dark hazy brown. It poured nice head that died quickly; but the lace held up all the way to the end. It has a very sweet taste on the front end; with a tart finish and a little bite. Somewhat smooth and creamy mouth feel. It has an interesting flavor, but lacked a well-rounded character.","SeanChouffe","Jun 03, 2003"
3.1,-16.4,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Originally sampled on 13 November 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Scotch Silly has a slight licorice nose,. The flavors are chewy, nutty and slightly roasty. it's a ice drinkable beer, but it is nothing outstanding. It's unusual for a Belgian, but there are many better scotch ales out there","jcalabre","May 19, 2003"
4,7.8,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Hazy ruddy chestnut hue, topped by a thick, yellowish tan, well retained creamy head. Respectable lace remains. The aroma is a sweettart combination of tart, underripe plums and deeply caramelized, dark crystal malt along with subtle butterscotch and burnt hints of roasted barley. Ripe fig sweetness initially in flavor yields to rounded notes of dark toffee and candied plums, while diacetyl and borderline sugary caramel malt persists as a constant foundation. Hints of burnt biscuit and mild hop bitterness partially offset residual sugars mid palate, but linger only briefly, lending overall balance well skewed towards malt sweetness. Becomes progressively more molasses like as it breathes. A bit light in body, with dextrins present at a functional, malt supporting level only. This, however, lends a pseudo crispness in mouthfeel that aids in dangerous drinkability. Faint notes of leather and earthy hops struggle to poke through the dominant caramel malt presence late. Finishes clean, simply sweet and abrupt. Certainly an odd brew. Although off the mark for a Scotch ale, Silly is flavorful and light on the palate. Whimsically sweet, but not cloying. Akin to a dubbel fermented with a more neutral British yeast. Unique and recommended.","marc77","Apr 29, 2003"
2.67,-28,4,2,2.5,3.5,3,"Heavy carbonation, sticky head sits over tea-like body. Aroma is weak and slightly lemony. The flavor is caramel dominant, molassas and a bit of char. Scuppernongs. The sweetness lacks support from other flavors. Seems unbalanced and odd, but not really old or infected. Not so great of a Scotch ale.","aracauna","Feb 01, 2003"
4.22,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Not the sort of beer that one would want to have several of in a night, but one of the better Scotch ales I've had in a long while.","Darkale","Jan 20, 2003"
3.95,6.5,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Cloudy deep brownish amber with some wonderful aromas, mostly grapes, cherry, and yes, plenty of alcohol. Enjoyable smooth mouthfeel that leaves an acidic, but not bad aftertaste on the tip of the tongue. Hop flavor and alcohol are quite prevalent, and this beer has got a serious kick to it. Glad I found this one, and there's nothing "silly" about it. Oh I'm hilarious.","IrishRedRock","Jan 07, 2003"
4.72,27.2,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a muddy brown, which quickly consolidates into deep black, topped with a spotty, roasted tan head. Great and powerful aromatics: grapes at first, followed by cherries, toffee, butterscotch. Sweets and alcohol, the perfect combination! You get the feeling of a candy bar, melted down and boozed up! Huge, thick malt on the palate, plus marvelous, lively hops doing their fandango on the taste buds, lush mouthfeel, and lasting finish. This Belgian Scotch ale is an absolute joy to drink, and makes a perfect dessert beer,or sweet, rewarding nightcap. Very mellow and relaxing. A classic","feloniousmonk","Jan 01, 2003"
4.27,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"The pour somewhat hazy deep amber to almost brown, the head substantial, frothy, and the residual lace a fine sheet to coat the glass. Nose is malt, molasses tones, sweet, a bit earthy or more to the point rye bread like. Front is malt, the top is light, finish is strikingly acidic, modestly hopped, dry and somewhat sour aftertaste, and the robustness stays still the last drop is wrenched from the glass. A belly warmer, and I think a must try for "Strong Beer" lovers.","Gusler","Dec 20, 2002"
4.75,28,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Dark amber/ruby in color, with a two-finger head that leaves a very nice lace. The aroma is complex and enticing: sweet, with a tart fruitiness, lots of spicy notes and a bit of biscuity malt. The taste is quite sweet, with both the malt on candi sugar contributing. A bit of a licorice-like flavor mid-palate combines with apricot-like fruity notes. Finish is sweet with hints of yeast, and just enough support from the hops to create balance. The alcohol is very well-hidden in this beer, and each sip left me anxious for another. Velvety-smooth, this makes an excellent dessert beer.","mzwolinski","Dec 12, 2002"
3.59,-3.2,3.5,4.5,3,4,3.5,"I bought a case of this ale in 1999 and enjoyed it over the last couple of years very much. But I think it has passed its prime. Good thing there are only two bottles left. Still, it is a tasty ale even with the sourness and if it has passed its prime. I will be buying more in the future and will update this review then if warranted.","purplehops","Nov 19, 2002"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"This is my first Scottish ale. This is a 330 ml bottle with an attractive green label. There is no freshness date. Pours a dark orange to brown with about 2 fingers of fluffy tan head that reduces to a thin layer only covering the top of the beer. Nice lace is left on the glass. The aroma is of toffee and malt. This is a medium bodied beer. The taste is of toffee and caramel, and you can really notice the alcohol. I really enjoyed this beer. This beer make me want to try more Scottish ales. It is a little to much alcohol to enjoy more then 1 or 2 of these.","Amdahl","Nov 10, 2002"
4.67,25.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Quite cloudy even after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Maybe my pour was rough? The body is a cloudy brown with orange-ish glows at the edges. The frothy tan head comes on strong and holds OK, but shortly drops to a thin 1/16" surface covering which holds throughout the glass and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is rich with fruit, yeast, and toffee/caramel maltiness. The body is medium/full with an extremely fine and mild carbonation that leaves it quite creamy and smooth in the mouth. Very nice! The flavor is very richly malty, starting with some dark fruitiness (raisins, soft dates, fig, and some underlying apricot - even light coconut as it warms and the malts combine!) that mellows as it warms and sweeter toffee notes emerge. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. The bitterness plays a supporting role, and it finishes semi-dry with some residual sticky maltiness and a touch of earthy/metallic hops (or is that oxidation?). Overall, a very rich and fairly complex beer that makes a nice appertif or after dinner drink. It also pairs well with rich "gravy" meats during the holiday season. Exceptional, and well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Nov 05, 2002"
3.86,4,4,3,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark, ruddy brown with a solid tan head.  The aroma is malty and grainy, but not nearly as intense as I would have preferred.  The beer is extremely sweet and malty, and a bit oily, with nut and caramel flavors.  Very heavy, thick mouthfeel, with a slight alcohol warming.  Very good for the style, and worth trying.","Suds","Beers"

3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Is it Silly Scotch or Scotch Silly? Super sweet malty aroma with a medium head and sticky lacing. Thick, almost syrupy body that hides the alcohol content surprisingly well. I will definitely try this one again someday.","Dogbrick","Jul 08, 2002"
3.9,5.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Nice head retention over a caramel colored beer.  The aroma was roasted malt with spicy undertones.  The taste was of spiced malt with evident alcohol.  The mouthfeel was full and smooth, but too potent a beer to drink more than one or two at a time.","ryanocerus","Beers"
4.1,10.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a medium dark amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that was like a float and left some nice lace.  A good deal of carbonation, usually accounting for the float look.  The aroma was of caramel, spice and malt.  The flavor was also of caramel and malt and was a bit sweet.  The finish was a bit bitter.  It hid it's alcohol content well.  I rather enjoyed the beer, even it the body was a little lighter than expected and a tad sweeter than I prefer.  Worth checking out in my opinon.","Wildman","0"
