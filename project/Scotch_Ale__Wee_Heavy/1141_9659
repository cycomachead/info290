I also appreciate the fact that the hops were noticeable, but not overpowering. Unfortunately, many North American brewers seem to be under the impression that Scottish ales should be made hoppier. Though this is not exactly a traditional wee heavy, it is a very good example of a North American take on the style that manages to be quirky and individualistic, but does not break entirely with tradition.","mrfrancis","Dec 26, 2013"

Speaking of Syrup, the maple syrup, the sweet maple flavor blends very well with the natural flavors befitting of scotch ales and especially with this one; sweet, caramely, malty, peaty, slightly smokey etc. But overall this beer is sweet. Not overly sweet, but sweet nonetheless. Good beer to try once, but this is something I definitely will not be buying again. Slightly dissapointed, since not only have I heard such amazing things about Dieu du Ciel!, but I also love wee heavies. I've had brown ales flavored with maple syrup before but never any scottish ales.

Some of the most prevalent toffee notes of any beer I have had. Also fig, raisin, caramel, lots of maple syrup. The malts are strong too. Medium body and light carbonation.

Alcohol is present, keeping sips small. The maple isn't as strong as I was expecting and definitely not as strong as I would have liked. Aftertaste is a little odd. I can't pin it, but I really wish it didn't linger like it does. Overall, I would say it's a interesting beer that I don't regret trying, but for the price tag, it isn't exactly the best choice at the store.

Pours hazy reddish brown color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Some nice bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, dark fruits, whiskey, spices, molasses, maple syrup, and alcohol. Some nice aromas that are improving a bit as it warms. Taste of big caramel, maple syrup, molasses, whiskey, spices, and a bit of wood. No bitterness noticed on the finish; and lingering notes of maple syrup, caramel, molasses, and some whiskey on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish noticed. Nice smooth drinkability for the level of alcohol, but is still a sipper. Nice balance of flavors. Overall a really nice scotch ale. The maple syrup definitely has a strong presence in this.","superspak","Oct 30, 2011"

Lots of lacing here as well, really starting to show off with how good this one really is. Rich caramel malts here, hints of herbal notes, and a touch of grass round it out very nicely, and as I take the first sip I am amazed at how big this one is. Really very full feel here with lots of carbonation and really a very well put together profile.

This was pared with a grilled pork chop with Dijon mustard and spice rub, sweet potatoes fries, and steamed broccoli. It blended well. However, the alcohol content (9.5% ABV) would prevent me from going more than one per session. For the flavor, I feel that it needed to be bigger to match the alcohol content.

Every one of there beers seem to gain quite a character and some definition between the expected and something quite unique. This is no different with their scotch ale. I just believe once settled in the bottle it gets a tad syrupy. There is definitely maple. Added and the predominate quality. Nose and palate with notes of warmth, honey, and toasted malt. Some cinnamon and subtle coriander. I can feel the sugar from on the glass even. Rich esters that are taken over by maple sweet. Although there are walnut notes.","rtepiak","Oct 24, 2010"

Smells fruity, malty and nutty with some banana, green apple, maple, and a little alcohol. Tastes unlike any other scotch ale I've had. It's malty and the maple that follows the fruity esters is not cloying or overpowering at all, but rather subtle. This is a hefty beer and the alcohol demands to much attention in the flavor, detracting from drinkability. Glad I killed my curiosity, but won't purchase this again.","qchic","Aug 07, 2009"

Lacing is OK. The aroma is sweet, it smells like maple syrup, toffee, bananas, wood and booze. It tastes like maple, apple brandy, bananas and toffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit rich and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. It would be much easier to drink if the booze taste wasn't so noticable. I probably should have aged this a bit longer as it's still hot. Overall, I think it's a decent brew that I would try again.

There is a strong maple flavor, very sugary. There is a dark fruit medley involved within the flavor as well. I guess I'd pick out figs, apricots, orange zest and caramel to be the forerunners in the flavor department. The booze hits you with a nice warmth and all-in-all this beer is sweet, thick and warming. A fabulous combination. All of this gets balanced out with a sharp bitterness at the end of each sip.

The malt is outplayed by the sweetness of the brew, no roasted qualities or smokiness. Way too sweet and boozy. The feel is chewy, a bit sticky, suprisingly not slick, prickly carbonation. Finishes sweet and hot from the ABV. A very disappointing Wee Heavy, not about the malt just about the booze. A very hot brew, sweet flavors; should showcase the malt. Boo.

Not very much going on in the nose with this one, sweet maple and a malt aroma are about it. I found this to be under carbonated when I tasted it, but a smooth flavor is there. Honey or maple syrup up front, with caramel and fruits later. I did not find it to be overly sweet and syrupy as it could've been.

Pure candy sugar with notes of vanilla. I'll have to try a fresh version. That one seemed a little unbalanced to me (1,75 yrs), aiming it all toward the maple taste.
