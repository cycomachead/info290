While not very remarkable, this does not mean it's bland, just that I've had better examples of the style. Of final note, it's actually quite drinkable - a very good beer to drink in quantity and wash down food with as a complement. Just enough flavor to complement and be enjoyable, not too much to overwhelm or clash with a meal. So I'll give it higher marks on drinkability than on being a good scotch ale.","damndirtyape","Apr 03, 2014"

Leaves some runny lacing with minimal sustainability through the glass. The nose was roasted malt and toffee with an overwhelming burnt sugar smell. If you've ever gotten sugar on a stove eye before, you know the smell. It was hard to get past. However, the taste was very pleasant overall. Had a nice fruity hop background to a huge malt bill.

The beer's flavor is a rich malt sweetness, which is well-balanced with subtle green, bitter hops. The body is round and smooth in mouth, with a slightly bitter finish that follows a scotchy-malt aftertaste.

4.5,25.7,4,4,5,4,4.5,"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed to 1.064 with pale, crystal, carapils, peated and Munich malt; hopped with magnum and goldings to 27 IBUs and fermented with English ale yeast. It pours almost ruby (more of an auburn), lightly-hazed, with medium carbonation and a thin cap. Rich and sweet in the nose from the Munich and crystal, blended with earthy, tea-like, nearly roasted notes. The flavor starts malty and rich, lightly sweet, followed by hops and an earthy fullness from the peat. Hints of raisiny crystals creep in here and there and are balanced by lightly spicy hops that contribute little bitterness. A flavorful yeast strain rounds it out and things end on a lightly peated note. While it begins crisp and dry, once the carbonation ebbs the body fills out nicely. Very nice brew here - a bit more hop flavor than most Scotch ales, but this is well-balanced and damn tasty. Definitely recommended.","mmmbeer","Jan 09, 2011"

The flavor was much the same. I didn't even detect any peated malt. Something really strange about this brew, not in a good way. I had to pour this one out.","clvand0","Dec 22, 2004"
3.21,-10.3,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This beer pours a golden amber color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is really strange. The first thing that comes to mind is tomato, some leather and spiceyness. I hope the flavor is different. What I get in the flavor is odd. I get the peated flavor, but it tastes a bit like leather. There is a bit of bite in the finish, but overall I don't like the beer all that much. Not what I want from a Scotch. The feel is rather thin, and drinkability suffers from the odd notes I get in the flavor and nose. I would not recommend this beer.","kmpitz2","Dec 16, 2004"
3.34,-6.7,4.5,3,3,3.5,4,"I had the pleasure to drink this beer back in the days when there was a LOT of peated barley presence (and it was still called "Maul Hammer.") It still has some decent mouthfeel, and when it warms up, you get just the slightest reminder of that smoky peat. It has always been a smooth drinker, to the point of being quite dangerous in its 6.5% abv past, but I think it's been dumbed down to the point of near-fogettability. Still, it's better than most US attempts at a Scottish style.","lastauss","Sep 23, 2004"
3.31,-7.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours a copper orange with a white cream head that fades rather quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and grilled fruit, alcohol lingers. The taste is very light for this style, roasted malts and fruit blend well with the alcohol tones, hopyp dryness bring up the rear. A drinkable Scotch Ale but lighter than most, I like Scotch Ales with a cigar but this one just doesn't quite make it to the cigar room.","beertaster13","May 30, 2004"
4.57,27.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Copper infused rust color, a bit of chill haze to it, large and thickly fluffed beige head sits well for a while before descending to a thin collar and the lacing sticks in strings and spots. Aroma is super yummy malt goodness, thick and dark caramel, super nice peat moss thats not overly smokey, but favorlaby earthy and has a terrific sweetness to it overall. Taste follows suit with a brigade of dark caramel and toffee sweetness with super nice earth tones and breadiness to make it rich and thick. Again the peat is there but not overwhelmingly smokey, it adds just enough to it to really go "Wow". Hops play underneath more towards the finish with a slight spice and bite helping the end of warmth and add to some of the slight dryness. Great feel, nearly full, very well rounded, and toothsweet smoothness and the low carbonation makes this a creamy thick treat to drink. The first thing that came to mind, and only after a few sips, is that its a whole hell of alot like a good barleywine. But without all the baggage of the higher ABV. A real plus and incentive to get alot more of this in the future, as it is quite a malty, yummy treat. One I would keep in my fridge alot if I could get it. Yummy! Did I already say that?","tavernjef","May 30, 2004"

3.87,8.1,4,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Notes: It has alot going for it but one thing that really is out of whack is the ultra thin mouthfeel. Still fairly drinkable, but it comes up short of a great beer.","BeerAngel","Apr 19, 2004"
3.78,5.6,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Pike Kilt Lifter Scotch Style Ale was served from a 22 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a clear orange caramel brown color, and was topped by a negligable head. that left weak lacing. The nose was quite malty, with a nice orange citrus presence and just a slight hint of peat smoke. I would have liked the peat to be more pronounced. I was pleasantly suprised by the taste though. A sweet flash is very quickly eclipsed by a powerful orange zippy bitterness, which lasts though to the drier, very estery earthy bitter finish...very nice and lively.. The body felt appropriately full for the flavors and style, but the carbonation was a bit lacking, which was apparant from the lack of a significant head. Overall, a very tasty effort that drinks well.","HiroProtagonist","Mar 20, 2004"

3.78,5.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Dark copper body with a light tan head. Smells of sweet, almost winey malts. Slight medicinal character and some hops too. Taste starts with the winey sweetish malts, bread pudding, and then a smokey-peat bog flavor. Finish is more bitter than other Scotch ales I've had, with lingering sweetness. Medium to big body, with a little syrupy feel. A little sweet to drink much.","alexgash","Nov 19, 2003"
3.56,-0.6,4,3,4,3,3.5,"Reddish brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Slightly hopped, very malty. Scotch like maltyness. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty with nice smoky undertones.","beerguy101","Sep 13, 2003"
4.1,14.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Clear, caramel-orange in color forming a beige head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is heavy with caramelized sugar, honey, vanilla, and a complete absence of hops. Taste begins with sweet caramelized sugar and malt, nuts, and a cookie-like sweetness. Peat comes in just at the end very end with a faint earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and a lightly dry finish. An enjoyable example of the style, and also more representative than most of the over-hopped, under-malted offerings by other breweries. Solid.","Mitchster","Jun 20, 2003"
4.18,16.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"It pours a deep mahogany with a nice, uneven head. Carbonation tops it in very sporadic patterns, like the yeast was still active. The smell is sweet and malty with a slight smoked tinge. The taste in this batch is a bit sweet, but normally its a wonderful full and chocolate body. If you're not careful, you can drink a whole sixer, and it really affects your skiing.","freed","May 16, 2003"
3.97,10.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A beauteous orange to amber color, the head prodigious in size, creamy in texture, a nice light tan in color and the residual lace a thick and sticky sheet to meld with the glass. Sweet malt is the nose, fresh and inviting, the start ambrosial, malt laden, and the top rich in its feel to the palate. Finish has a delectable acidity, the hops spicy and pleasant, dry aftertaste and a real treat.","Gusler","Apr 24, 2003"
4.03,12.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Real nice beer. I don't know if it can be called a "wee heavy", didn't seem thick enough, but the flavor was wonderful. Tad on the hpbby-bitterness side, but I am not saying that is bad at all. The color was a nice suprise, I kept holding it up to the light. I look forward to trying it there again sometime. I have to leave the family home though, they wouldn't let my daughter in the place, not even to sit on the couch. Kinda anal about that.","Fabric8r","Apr 03, 2003"

4.3,20.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"(from notes at brewery) Nice amber color with a good nose to boot.  Nicely fruity and malty sweet with a pretty well hidden alcohol profile.  Was very smooth drinking and light on mouthfeel.  Surprisingly, there were quite a bit of floral hop flabors in there, but it did not detract too much from the style and was a nice variant.","jreitman","Jul 27, 2002"
4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Daniel's point on the hops is well taken. But I dissagree with him on the body being too light. Kiltlifter does have a lighter body but not every Scotch ale is a Wee-heavy. I think if you were to put this beer in a 60 shilling (or light) catagory then the body fit just fine. The malt profile is supurb and could not be better. I did take off a point for too much hop for the style but in their defense it is brewed in the middle of hop country so extra hops are hard to resist.","mattmaples","Oct 05, 2001"
4.54,26.8,4,5,4,5,5,"A little to light for a scotch ale, both in terms of taste and color.  Instead of a chewy brew you get a medium-bodied ale that is a touch too bitter.  Since most scotch ales are naturally sweet (though not overwhelmingly so), I was slightly disappointed with this one.","DrDocRudge","Aug 28, 2001"
