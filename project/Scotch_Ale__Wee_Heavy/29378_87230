3.79,-3.1,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured a semi-clear reddish brown with one finger of off-white head. A very good appearance, quite true to style. Scents of caramel, chocolate. sweet berries, a light saltiness and hints of molasses. Overall impression of aroma is of an odd scotch ale, fruitier than many, but with caramel present as is usual. The saltiness is an interesting addition. Not as richly malty as it should be however, which is a demerit. Flavor begins malty with notes of caramel, molasses, and a noticeable berry presence and plum and dried fruit esters with an extremely light saltiness. Middle continues these flavors but adds a light bittersweet chocolate flavor. Finish is lightly dry with notes of lightly roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate coming to the fore, yet with the aforementioned flavors also still present in lower levels, and a slight touch of alcohol apparent. Aftertaste is light roasted malt, caramel, bready malt and light coffee. Overall impression of flavor is of a scotch ale, at a light level, with a bit of the advertised salt and a lot less malt than is typical for the style. Still quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation and a slightly thick feel with a smooth alcohol present. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good light end scotch ale, true to form. Overall this is an okay scotch ale. The flavor could use more work, and the aroma is good, but not as good as some. Still pretty good.","Auraan","Feb 27, 2015"

I did not get the salt but perhaps it was an essential part of the overall  deep rich flavor profile. A not cloying sweetness too, that meant the flavor stayed away from rich deep stout or porter territory although the body did approach that of a stout.","nychas","Nov 01, 2014"

3.6,-7.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Poured from the bomber into an English pub glass. A deep reddish bronze or brown brew with a shocking lack of head. Upon pouring, I get a fleeting inch or so of whitish bubbles that disappear almost instantly. Scottish ales are not known for good head retention but this was nevertheless interesting. Aroma is rich and sweet, tons of toffee and dark fruit (raisin, date) and maybe a hint of citrus/piney hops (foreshadowing things to come). Palate was where this brew lost me a little. Immediate effect is burnt caramel and boozy apple/pear cider, with some vanilla and a vague salty presence coming through. The hops are leafy and resinous, making this brew rather medicinal and bitter for the style. Usually I dig Parallel 49's hoppy excesses but not so much here. Citric and fruity is the main sensory impression for me, although a pleasant malty smoke does build over time. Thin-bodied for a "wee heavy" and comes across as quite fizzy despite the absence of head. I guess all the gas lurks in the brew. Finishes wet, with a mixture of toffee, smoke, sour fruit, and pine. Final assessment is that there is some merit but I'd pass on another opportunity. I am looking for a thicker mouthfeel and a richer sweetness with this style. This beer indeed malty but there are too many fruit and hop effects going on here that detract from the caramel flavors.","CalgaryFMC","0"

That said, it came recommended and it was suggested it would be a good post dinner (dessert) beer which I found intriguing... As a Wee Heavy, I would say they've done a nice job with the style, and I would say they've taken a part of the Scottish Ale (slightly alcoholic/warming/sweet) and taken those characteristics and played on them by adding the sea salt which is noticeable, and turned this into a delicious dessert style beer not typical of this style. Everything is well balanced, making it not only easy drinking but making sure all the flavours stand out. I can see why people are giving cudos to this young brewery as they are already on the right track with a decent offering of beers out there. Worth trying, especially if you like Scotch Ales, and goes really well at this time of year....","4ster","Dec 18, 2012"

4.12,5.4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O - The caramel and sea salt are both present without being overbearing which is really nice coming from something that easily could've been a mediocre novelty beer. Very impressed with this brew from Parallel 49 as I have been with everything I've tasted from the boys on Triumph Street. I'll definitely pick up a couple bottles of this before they're gone.","thefullpython","Nov 30, 2012"

4.27,9.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Wow, this beer smells like a Salted Caramel Latte from Starbucks! This is one of those beers that is all about the added flavour, not about the beer. What I mean is, there is pretty much zero beer flavour here. The taste is entirely dominated by an out-of-this-world extremely delicious caramel flavour, with a slightly salted aftertaste. The caramel is rich and thick, with hints of maple, brown sugar, and plum. The finish is mostly where I taste the salt, and it pairs perfectly with the caramel. I suppose what is making me rave about this beer is the intensity of the flavour. I was expecting a scotch ale with hints of salty caramel, but really this is salty caramel with a hint of scotch ale: beer and dessert all wrapped up in one great bottle!","Cookeeman","Nov 25, 2012"

3.92,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: Enjoyable and very drinkable, the caramel could have been overdone, however it manages to enhance and highlight the brew. The salty flavours are represented by the mineral notes, like adding a small amount of salt to water.","FondueVoodoo","Beers"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"With 3 seasonal releases this winter ( all good as well) Parallel 49 is my choice for new brewery of the year. This is a classic wee heavy that has salted caramel added. The colour is on the lighter side for the style and the mouthfeel is lively and smooth. I noticed more hops than usual for this beer which helps balance out the caramel notes on the finish. The salted caramel is not too intrusive but rather works with the malty midbody. Great cold weather beer that goes so well with bread pudding.","canucklehead","0"
