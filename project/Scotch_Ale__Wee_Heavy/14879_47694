3.68,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice scotch ale. Good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. Really needed to be a bit bolder on malt flavors, but still a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

An interesting take on the style, it leans decisively toward the sugar end of this style's spectrum, and lacks the peaty smokiness and malt-dominant expressions most try to achieve. Keeping that in mind, I definitely recommend this as a nitecap to be savored.","BuckeyeSlim","Oct 29, 2012"

3.41,-8.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A reddish amber color with a decent off-white head and similar lacing. It’s a bit hazy with particulate. The aroma is full of cinnamon apple and mild cherry malt alcohol. Very odd and not exactly thrilling me. Certainly not what I expected. The flavor brings more of the cherry-apple sweetness along with wheat wine ideas. Some grassy rhubarb bitterness hidden in there. It’s medium bodied but with a fairly aggressive carbonation that tempers a bit of a wine-like feel. This is good enough but not as good as most of my previous Hoppin’ Frog experiences, and certainly nothing approaching the label’s promising descriptions. But still worth a try, especially if your a fan of wheat wines.","Durge","Aug 24, 2012"

The taste holds notes of molasses, cloves, maple syrup, red apple skin, lemongrass, and that hot cinnamon you'd find in tasty, breath-freshening gums (y'know, the kind with flavor crystals and whatnot).

Overall this had a good scent and a great taste and body. It was very sweet and malty from the scotch ale style, but it was also very juicy from the red ale style, which was a great blend. The alcohol was undetectable and the beer had a super smooth finish, so this was dangerously easy to drink. It wasn't the most bold scotch ale ever, but it was unique and very rewarding, and crazy drinkable. Definitely recommended.","Pencible","May 04, 2010"
3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Comes out of the bottle a nice, warm, clear cinnamon brown with a decent off-white head that does not stick around too long. Aroma is mainly malty with a sweet, fruity overtone. Flavor is mainly fruity, apple and banana, rather sweet but not cloying, with a nice malty undertone and just a whisper of hops. Texture is pleasantly smooth and has a little fizz to it.","Cyberkedi","Mar 30, 2010"

3.5,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is toasted malt, caramel, and some toffee. Taste is sweet and malty. It's similar to the aroma, it tastes like toasted malt, caramel, tea, and a little bit of spice, likely from the rye in this beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is a decent enough beer, but this isn't one of the better Scotch Ales I've had. With that being said, it's worth a try.","bluejacket74","Sep 14, 2009"

3.95,5.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a nice dark red/caramel color with some nice head and almost decent lacing. Deep malty scent with hints of caramel. Deep malty flavor as well, with a little caramel in the taste and a huge warming hit of alcohol in it. Great winter beer, but I would've liked a little less alcohol and a lot more malted peat (of which I got no notice of). Still, a nice deep malty brew.","JamesS","Sep 12, 2009"

3.65,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 oz. Amber pour, not real dark. Nearly no head to speak of, some whitish bubbles. Smell has some sweetness, malt, raisin, peat. Taste is not nearly as sweet as I was expecting. Some malt, toffee, but some sour/bittersweet fruit like green apple. Gets slightly better as it warms, with some peat and char adding to more malt sweetness. Lack of carbonation hurt the mouthfeel a bit, but it was not non-existent. Alcohol is not noticeable. Overall a bit disappointed, not as good as their darker brews I've had. Nearly makes me wonder if I got a bad bottle.","Bung","Jun 29, 2009"

3.64,-2.4,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a coppery amber with no head and almost no bubbling. The aroma is a candy caramel toasted malt with a litte nutty liquer mixed in. The taste is super malty from start to finish. But sweet caramel malts with a more candy like note into the middle of the palate. The finish stays pretty sweet throughout and no noticeable hops or rye as the label states. The abv adds a Frangelica like taste and warm feel as well. Pretty smooth but also syrupy palate. Took me bout an hour two enjoy all 22ozs of this beer. A sipper.","scruffwhor","0"

Bready, touch of alcohol, touch of maple syrup. Moderate mouthfeel. A very good example of a scotch ale.
