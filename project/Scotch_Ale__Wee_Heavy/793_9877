Nose is a caramel malt, with something like a rye spiciness behind it, maybe a hint of booze, burnt sugar.  Taste follows nose- caramel, mild spice, fairly sweet with bitterness on the followthrough, a little dark fruit.  Finish is bitter, boozy, and leaves that spice flavor (maybe nutmeg?).  Creamy carbonation, very fine bubbles.  Pretty good, step up from Warped Speed for sure.","RobinLee","Oct 22, 2014"

The smell of the beer is funky... It should be sweet and malty, smells like it was aged in oak or something. Just too funky for a Scotch Ale in my opinion. The taste is tart, very sour off the first sip. The finish is more of the malty scotch ale shining through. The mouthfeel is decent, a little thin for the style and some sharp carbonation. Overall this beer would probably be good I just think something got infected here. Would be willing to try it again in the future with hopes of a better outcome.","Knapp85","Feb 03, 2013"

As it is, authentic malt-derived flavors are tossed about and sent fleeing by the scathing carbonic acid that sticks in the throat. It also struggles with style identity a bit, easily mistakable for a doppelbock or conservative quad in lieu of a wee heavy.","beagle75","Jun 19, 2012"

A sip of the medium-heavy body reveals dense layers of the same sweet malts with large wallops of nutty flavors and no hint at all of the alcohol content inside. Very small hop accents of grassy and earth tones show themselves towards the end of the sip and smooth things out, but remain background level enough to keep things appropriate for a well-made scotch ale. Silky smooth in texture. The only nitpick I could find is that it could use a smidgeon of smokiness. That said, I definitely recommend trying this one!","WastingFreetime","Feb 09, 2012"

Medium hop bitterness and a bit of alcohol dry out and balance the sweet malt nicely. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate.

Chocolate, rich caramel, yeasty, some fig but much less estery than the warped speed. Big malt caramel, chocolate, toffee, candied sugar, pecans, nice sweetness with a balanced and mild bitterness.

3.83,-7.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, one of my favorite scotch ales. I think this would actually be a better beer if the alcohol were lower.

3.67,-11.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a cloudy apple cider-like color, sparse off-white ring of foam. Not much lacing. Smells like caramel malt and some red fruit (mix of candied cherry and strawberry), brown sugar, hop earthiness, slight alcohol. Taste is mostly caramel malt, alcohol, along with something that makes it taste like a macro lager. Like a dry lager yeast or something; reminds me of MGD. I am confused now. Medium body and low carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good scotch ale, nice and somewhat unique smell, but taste leaves a little to be desired.","pmarlowe","Aug 16, 2011"

4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear brown with an off white head of foam. Caramel hits hard in the nose, with light hops in the background. Other notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and booze make this one similar to a dark chocolate roasted caramello bar. Taste is caramel again, with nice boozy warmth, toasted/roasted malts and a wonderful lingering finish of toffeeness. Mouthfeel is a little thin but that lends to the excellent drinkability","francisweizen","Feb 08, 2008"
3.98,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D- This beer has a good smooth flavor with some nice depth. The light note of smoke does a good job of enhancing the malt without tasting like band aids.","rhoadsrage","Jan 28, 2008"
4.35,4.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark toffee brown, fairly clear, with a thin, fine skim of beige foam. The bubbles formed a solid collar and produced quite a bit of delicate lace. Toffee/caramel aroma, a hint of cocoa and roast, light smoke. Low bitterness with a lot of malt, mostly toffee and caramel sweetness, light hoppiness and chocolate notes, some alcohol and smoke in the finish. Medium to full bodied with smooth, soft carbonation. A little on the creamy side with some warmth. This stuff is really quite good. I could sip on this all night.","DrJay","Jan 27, 2008"

4.15,0,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Quite a bit of punch here which is probably due to the alcohol. I like the lasting flavors and slight lacing which also hung around for a while. Read some information on Louie Reserve and it looks like the alcohol at 9% to 10% is what I am sensing. I did not get the caramel either but then I dont always know what Im doing. Looks like I was lucky to pick up a six of this.","SMark","Dec 11, 2007"

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: The 9% is so well hidden that I'd be hardpressed to put the abv above 6%. The ale is warming and full without being to sweet. An incredible beer that is worth the accolades. Easily one of the best wee heavies that I've ever had.","akorsak","Oct 07, 2007"

The nose is malty, slightly oaky, cherries, figs, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is malty/oaky, nice presents of dark fruit, some tanginess, nice touch of caramel. The finish is dry.

The smell is a little sour and smells like a scotch ale. The taste is a little clove with a big Scotch ale taste. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and slightly fizzy.

Complex aroma: caramel apple, smoke, butter rum, meat, scorched brown sugar, leather, and light peat bog. Big earthy sweet caramelly malt flavors up front. Rummy fruits and sweet bread combine with leather, spiced pudding, and peat. Mild, pleasant, peppery bitterness follows. Residual malty sweetness in the finish. Full-bodied, coating feel. Excellent beer! So malty and complex!","alexgash","Dec 26, 2006"

3.85,-7.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"After drinking so many hoppy beers it is good to go to the malty side and this was a great departure. Filtered darker red/amber with a distinct malt and buttered caramel popcorn nose. I'm not getting any peat just a lot of the same flavors as the smell. This needs to be enjoyed slowly since warming really helps bring some excellent flavors forward in a big bodied beer. I liked the warped speed much better. Someone get me a Lake Louie t-shirt! Yet another dirtylou beer.","lou91","Dec 11, 2005"
4.5,8.4,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4" tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. What head there is fades relatively slowly, with bubbly lacing prevalent. Aroma is vanilla and alcohol, with sweetness also weighing in. Taste is almost a light mocha sweetness, touches of peat smoke, and a vanilla alcohol close. Mouthfeel is awesome for the style and abv, and drinkabilty is only limited by how much you can find. Another great Wee Heavy from these guys.","ppoitras","Dec 04, 2005"
4.47,7.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice American example of a Wee Heavy. Sticky sweet malts govern, with an assertive smoky character and ideal hop bitterness for a well executed complexity. Very enjoyable! Thanks to kmpitz2 for this superb bottle.","merlin48","Nov 28, 2005"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an amber color with almost no head and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of sweetness and some caramel - and graham cracker, as kmpitz2 said. The nose didn't really do it for me. The flavor actually got better as it warmed - I really didn't like this beer at all when it was really cold, but it got better as it got warmer. The flavor has a lot of sweetness, caramel, and some burned malt. Finish is somewhat oily. The drinkability is pretty good for the alcohol and the mouthfeel is moderate.","clvand0","Nov 09, 2005"
4.38,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a full-on deep amber color with a light swirl of something over top. I wouldn't call it head, but its pretty cool looking. Nose is caramel and brown-sugary sweet, with notes of graham crackers and chocolate. Just hints of alcohol play in the back. Flavor is rather brown-sugar sweet, with a moderate burnt to smokey note and a bitterness that hangs on the finish, but it is not from hops. Nothing lingers too long. Feel is slightly syrupy slick, thick with a light carbonation. For 9%, this one really goes down smooth and doesn't let on to the alcohol content. The more I drink this one the more it grows on me. Glad I have some to hang onto and drink.","kmpitz2","Nov 07, 2005"
4.28,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"There's a bit of an alcohol burn in the otherwise smooth, creamy mouthfeel that detracts from the drinkability; other than this, though, Louie's Reserve is a hell of a beer. Better than Warped Speed? I'm not sure, and I'm leaning toward no--but that's hardly something of which to be ashamed.","battlekow","Oct 24, 2005"

4.97,19.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a dark garnet/mahogany with a finger and a half of khaki head that fades to a whispy coating, Nose is phenomenal: barrel-aged bourbon, warm vanilla, chocolate-covered cherries, smokey caramel. Just amazing. Taste is just as complex and warm as the nose: a hearty caramel malt backbone smothered in woody vanilla ice cream, sweet cherries, chocolate caramels, a light floral hop bite for balance and a healthy warming alcohol that spreads quickly throughout your chest. Body is velvety smooth and creamier than cream, yet insanely drinkable. This really seems like a barrel-aged scotch here, sublimely mellow yet incredibly complex.
