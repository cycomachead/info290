Slightly floral, and I don't know if it's just suggestive, but I get a little cinnamon. Flavor is the best apple product I've ever had. I'm not a huge apple fan, but that lingering apple flavor is balanced nicely between sweet red and a sour note reminiscent of an oud bruin. Pleasantly surprised with the complexity. Wish I had bought more.","barczar","Aug 21, 2014"

A tangy apple bite comes through in the nose, maybe a little caramel in there too. It smells like cider in a way that no other ale does: right up my alley. Taste is appley and tangy up-front. The sides give a little pucker. It's pretty much apple until the finish, which has some malty wheat flavor. After the apple fades (5 mins or so) there's a vegetal aftertaste that I don't recall from the previous bottling. Mouthfeel is medium with lots of carbonation, which tingles the tongue and the throat on the way down. Overall it's well-made, lots of apple, some acidity, some tanginess. It isn't very complicated but it's very, very enjoyable. It tastes a bit like cider, but it isn't, so I give it extra points for the style. Here's hoping this special edition brew continues to make a regular appearance.","foobula","Jun 17, 2014"

Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, green apple, pastry, bread, sugar, and apple pie. The flavor was of sweet malt, pastry, green apple, sugar, apple pie, and subtle wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Upon first investigation of this one I was knocked back by the aroma of apple pie. I couldn’t believe what I was smelling! This beer smelled like America! So right out of the gate I was excited to try this one. The flavor even carried over on this one with the same components. I’m really glad this was the case because usually a lot is lost between the two when I really enjoy the aroma. Really well done on this one New Glarus!","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

You're looking to join in, but instead want something with a little kick instead. And you wonder to yourself, "What should I go buy?" BAM! New Glarus Apple Ale, that's what. This is a great fall/winter seasonal. Pours like pressed apple cider with a beautiful sour smell. I mentioned to a good friend that this makes me feel like a cross between Father Christmas and a Founding Father, as I imagine this style was big in the mid 1700s. Sour apple taste, that's it man, apple, no malt, no hops, just apples. A little tingly on the tongue, but nothing special in the mouth. High drinkability due to low ABV and a great taste. I should save a couple of these for Christmas Eve, but they won't last that long.","billyzoom666","Dec 08, 2012"

My biggest problem with it is that it's like drinking apple juice, with a small chaser of beer. I wish there were more beer in it. I'm conflicted - as a fruit drink, it's freaking delicious.

Absolutely lovely apple aromas emanate from the glass, not quite real, but not quite fake. Reminds me a bit of an apple schnapps by Dad drinks. Taste is obviously apple-forward, but a much more identifiable "Red Apple" flavor as opposed to the generic "Apple" aromas. There's a touch of light grain, some honey, and an almost cinnamon-like quality in here too. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy, with a fairly thin body and good, carbonation. Overall an entirely enjoyable brew that 100% lives up to my expectation. I feel that a six-pack of this would disappear quite fast. Cheers to The CPJ for sending it my way!","jsanford","Jul 05, 2012"

Not the typical green apple aroma I get from most Belgian beers. Very unique. Hints of cinnamon. This smells better than any apple cider or sparkling cider I have ever had...and the fact that it's a beer absolutely blows my mind. Taste is initially sweet red apple...which somehow changes to a VERY mildly tart green apple. I know I read reviews of this beer tasting like a green jolly rancher...and they are absolutely right. That is my favorite jolly rancher, and now, it's in beer form. This is weird, because this is not a beer that I would drink on the regular, but for the style being a "fruit beer"....this is the best I've ever had. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and sparkling cider-like. Drinkability is extremely high. Overall, this beer is tasty...I don't care who you are, if you are a fan of apples, you will love this beer.

Mouthfeel was on the thin side and the taste was of lightly spiced apple juice.

Apples are the only smell from this beer and to be honest it doesn't even smell the slightest bit alcoholic. Taste is of all of the apple products in the smell along with some spice flavors that remind me of apple pie. Carbonation level is fairly high which makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel.

Taste is a pure shot of fresh apple upfront with a very nice sweetness that turns tart as it lingers, followed by a hint of spice...maybe nutmeg. After that, the taste lingers with a bready finish not unlike pie crust. The mouth is slightly prickly with carbonation, but balanced by a smooth slickness. The finish is dry and pleasant.

You don't get sick of the sweetness, at least after one bottle. Malts work well to counter act the sweetness and to keep you wanting more. Mouth feel is light to medium with good carbonation.

So, apples, cinnamon, pie crust (you know the scent), a touch of nutmeg...yeah, the basic apple pie deal. A touch of light wheat sits in the background, an old dunce's cap firmly thereatop. The taste ditches the pie to focus on the filling. Straight up, apple pie filling all the way here, with heavy emphasis on red apples in particular.

It pours a very clear copper shade, with a small head that dissipates quickly; a great deal of carbonation is visible at first, but soon disappears. The nose is rather light, with just a hint of that slight apple-and-vinegar scent one finds in some ciders. The taste, too, recalls apple cider, and as far as I'm concerned, this beer is absolutely delicious.

I didn't recognize it the first time I had it but it was the most obvious thing the second time around and made for a wonderfully complex flavor.

The taste is mainly of spiced apple cider, there is an allspice and cinnamon note that you would find in cider. I really must admit it's rather tasty, but I really don't consider it to be much of a beer.

Thats the only smell at first, but I pick up some more subtle bready, hoppy beer scents as I smell more closely. It's a fantastic smell. I was expecting it to have the fall baking spices added like pumpkin beers. I'm very glad it wasn't. The taste is much like the smell. Very crisp, juicy fresh sweet and sour apple flavors, with just a hint of bread and hops to make you realize this is a beer. That's kind of my problem. I love beer, and I love apples, but does it make either better to put them together? I really like Woodchuck hard cider as a change of pace. This tasted a lot like that except it had a bready, malty base that didn't fit with the apple flavor. That really kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it? I did like the flavor. It's one of the more enjoyable fruit flavored beers I've had. Someone used to cider or wine who is crossing over to beer would be a good audiance for this. Overall, it's a unique and pleasant tasting beer.","lester619","Nov 18, 2010"

Even the mouthfeel has the same viscosity as apple juice. The drinkability of this is funny in that it is related to the season,lol.

Poured into two open mouth red wine glasses. Pours a beautiful sunset gold. Smell is overwhelmed by the essence of fresh cut macintosh. Just a slight malty hint. No sign of hops. Taste is simply stated as very good cider. Can notice almost nothing of a bitterness and as in the smell only a hint of very light malts. Mouthfeel is great, very smooth. This in my opinion which gives this beer its own. A medium body, silky almost which lingers for a good minute after drinking. Far too easy of a "beer" to drink. Overall though a very nice drink.

Except for a touch of yeast funk, this is pretty indistinguishable from a sweet hard cider. Not bad for what it is- a nice dessert beer, or alternatively, a component in a cocktail.

As the beer disappears from my glass, no lacing is present. As somewhat of a cider aficionado, I definitely expected a slight haze from the apples but to my surprise it poured completely crystal clear. The aroma is fresh off the tree golden golden delicious apples coated in sweet caramel eaten off a stick at the fairgrounds. The flavor is exactly the same. It completely reminds me of a fresh artisanal caramel apple. It's completely amazing how they bottled that flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and just finishes a little to sweet.

Fresh pressed apple cider, apple skins, sweet and tart apples, candied apples, and I swear I smell a touch of cinnamon. Is my brain tricking me into smelling cinnamon? Who knows.

First couple of sips taste almost exactly like a good, healthy apple cider and juice mix. Not real sugary sweet, but really fresh and natural. After the first few sips it mellows a bit and I get a more active mouthfeel to it. More bite and carbonation. It tastes more like a beer and less like the apple juice towards the back of your tongue. really interesting and tasty beer. Smooth yet crisp mouthfeel.

Aftertste is slightly dry with a cider like flavor. I just wish there was a touch more sour on tongue, but really, this beer (and I use that term loosely) is delicious.

Light-medium carbonation, lighter side of medium bodied with a crisp, dry finish. Excellent drinkability, I'd be drinking plenty of this if it were still produced.

There's also some tartness to it and it has some slight sulfur smells like in a lager. The taste hits you with a very sweet apple juice-like taste and then the tartness hits the tip of the tongue and after that the lager-like sulfur flavors come in to finish up the taste. It's a very light bodied beer. I also taste some smooth malty flavors that can be found in Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. The light lager smells kind of go to backround and aren't as noticeable after a while. The mouthfeel is very nice and doesn't give me any problems whatsoever.

The taste is of apples, although a touch of malt can be found if you look close enough. It's very delicately carbonated, and surprisingly much fuller in the mouth than might be expected.

Aroma is deeply of sweet apples, with a tinge of sour here and there. Smells like cider. Taste is pretty much cider as well, but as much sour component, and this incorporates the slightest of discernable malt character, adding a smoothness at the end.

Not tart or sour, but just a nice apple smell. Not sure how they did that and avoided the sourness. The flavor is excellent. Lots of non-sour apple flavor with some caramel. Wish I knew how they did this beer because I would brew it as my house beer. Loved it.","clvand0","Dec 07, 2004"
4.77,15.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Picked this beer up near my inlaws over turkey day. We're having it along with some apple pie just to accentuate it. The beer pours an amber color with hints of golden in there. The nose is full on apples. Not a lot of the tart apple, but I think I like it. DAMN. What a nice flavor. I wish my apple homebrew was liket this. The apple is up front and in my faaaace (for you Chris). The finish is caramel sweetness from the malts. No detectable hop really. Feel is moderate, but what I expect on this beer. Drinkability is huge. I want to drink more and more and more. What a great beer. I really like it and will buy more of it if I find it when home.","kmpitz2","Dec 05, 2004"
4.17,1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours golden with a slight red hue. Little head with decent retention and lacing. Smell of a freshly cut apple. The taste is of biting into a fresh Macintosh apple, finish with malts and hints of cinamon. Remeniciant of the Belgian Red, supstitute apples for cherries. Very good brew, what I would expect of New Glarus.","donnyw","Nov 24, 2004"
3.73,-9.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Deep orange robe, almost clear. Diminishing beige head. Direct apple compote nose overwhelms the senses. Shredded apple flesh thrown up the nostrils in a sweet fashion. Riped delicious (the brand) apple crustade, pie crust. Nice warming medium body, very comfortable, low carbonation. This is definitely interesting, but not in the leagues of the raspberry tart for instance. Maybe Im just more of a raspberry guy, but this seems sweet and simple, which Im aware the other one is also, but it fails to take on me and surpass futile concepts like caring about the complexity rather than overall enjoyment. Here, rather than smelling like a fresh harvest, it appears a bit oldish (which it sure isnt). I fear this wont age well at all, but Im very glad to have sampled it. Cheers Barry!","Rastacouere","Nov 21, 2004"
4.77,15.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Nice looking copper appearance. Slight off-white head leaves sparse lace. Quite the inviting juicy apple aroma. Very pronounced and nicely blended. Maybe a little cinamon as well. Malt is in the background too. There is a great, juicy sweet apple taste to this beer. But also ghostly tartness as well. A blend of Cortland, MacIntosh and Jonathon apples was used. Slight cinamon character. Some light barley notes in the back and a bit of a drying character coming from the hops. Easily the best apple beer or cider I've enjoyed. New Glarus has got a handle on fruit beers.","Bighuge","Nov 16, 2004"
4.21,1.9,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a light brown ale with medium head with very little retention. Aroma is, without any surprises, comprised of sweet apple. Taste is also overtaken by the apple juice taste, which is great since the apples that were incorporated in here are fresh, sweet (but not too sweet) and with just enough sourness in them. Malt and hops are very hard to taste. Body is just above average with some light carbonation. This is one fine fruit beer, well balance and without the concentrated feel to it.","Phyl21ca","Nov 01, 2004"
4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This stuff slides down like silk with little resistance. Some concerns that this isn't much of a beer, but I think if you add the bitterness of hops and a stronger malt body, the taste would completely fall apart. This is sweet enough to be a dessert beer or enjoyed alone by itself for you to discover its nuances. Combine this with a slice of fresh apple pie and vanilla ice cream and you've got a perfect match.","Winter","Oct 27, 2004"
3.97,-3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Apple Ale is my first New Glarus beer and it's a winner. Apples and beer. A match made in heaven? Nope, Wisconsin.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 24, 2004"
2.85,-31,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"I enjoy the Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart quite a bit, but this is hardly drinkable for me. It maintains the fruit, but lacks the nuance. It's just not in the same league.","cokes","Oct 11, 2004"
4.34,5.1,4,5,4,5,4,"Well, New Glarus has done it again, these guys just cannot miss on the fruit beers. True, I probably couldnt drink more than one due to the inherant sweetness. But I must reccomend this beer to everyone that can get their hands on it. It is pricier like all the NG fruit beers, but that is understandable because you can tell they dont skimp on the fruit. Get it while you can!","bnuttz","Oct 08, 2004"
4.94,19.6,4,5,5,5,5,"One thing to note, this is exactly as the label says..an Apple Ale. If you do not like apples or cider in general, you will be wasting your time with this one.","ALESwhatCURESya","Oct 02, 2004"
4.97,20.3,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I could drink this stuff easier than I could water. This beer is cutting it close, and is right on par with their other fruit beers, mabye even better. Wow, this is tasty, tasty stuff.","Skidz","Sep 24, 2004"
