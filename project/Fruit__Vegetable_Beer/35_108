There are some great subtle flavors in there like the biscuit, honey, and malt, but they are just overpowered by the impending robitussin-esque combination of Cherry and alcohol. I mean, it's not sink pour bad, but I would definitely only use it as a last resort beer at a party you didn't want to go to but are now stuck at for several hours.

3.54,12.7,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Ahhh... Sam Cherry Wheat... a guilty pleasure of mine for years. As a more refined beer drinker, I'm not supposed to like this... but I do. Perhaps since it is brewed with MI cherries and I am a son of the mitten state.  Maybe because it brings me back to my youth, with cherry cough syrup nostalgia. Or possibly because it's just a unique and flavorful beer experience that conjures fond memories. Poured in to a tulip glass, it fills with a hazy, golden honey color and one inch of white froth. The head dissipated quickly, leaving only a thin ring atop the nectar-like liquid. Maraschino cherries and honey sweetness in the nose. A touch of cereal grain and subtle noble hop character. There is certainly ample cherry flavor that brings a medicinal quality, but it is washed away in the finish with a wheat thin like aftertaste. The hops brighten the beer with only a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is average, but suits the brew well. It is deliciously drinkable for such a polarizing concoction. This is sure to turn some people off with its cherry lozenge likeness, but to others it's a perfect pleasure that can be savored on occasion. I typically crush these pretty quickly, so maybe savor is the wrong word.  Maybe I drink them fast because it has a relatively tame ABV and it's refreshing. Or possibly because I want to hide the evidence as quickly as possible. Either way,  I will continue to enjoy these from time to time.","JohnnyI","Dec 29, 2014"

Smell is cherry cough drops almost and sugary with a little hop and yeast smell. Color is light red maybe almost a darker pink. Head disappears quickly to almost nothing but with lacing. The taste is light medium feel and a sugary artificial cherry flavor to a little bit of hops and then the wheat beer comes through. I forced finished one and later on could not finish the second because the flavor just became unpleasant and ended up dumping the rest.","Urk1127","Nov 03, 2014"

Quite nice looking. Scents of cherries, a bit of cream, not much else. A simple, fruity aroma. Flavor is rather subdued, but pleasant, beginning with cherry with a faint medicinal hop undertone. In the middle wheat malt graininess joins the profile and hop flavors are grassy and slightly medicinal. Finish is sweet with notes of cherry and low levels of grassy hop bitterness. Aftertaste is grassy hops and grainy malt. A nicely fruity, fairly refreshing wheat beer flavor profile. Mouthfeel is creamy with moderate carbonation and a slight acidity on the finish. Refreshing and quite easy to drink. Overall this is a fairly nice pale wheat with a nice refreshing, fairly simple, flavor profile.","Auraan","Jun 29, 2014"

OCCASION: post-baseball banquet unwinding...APPEARANCE: hazy, cloudy off-yellow body; slight effervescence; nice, thick, somewhat rocky snow white head; reasonable, patterned lacing... AROMA: tart punch of cherries, yes--slightly malty, bready scents underscore the equally understated hops--but mostly, cherries... PALATE: medium-bodied, fizzy, carbonated--not as refreshing as expected, but more body too... TASTE: malt profile disrupts the cherry prominence, as does the honey which forms a funky, unsettled finish...some cardboard notes further damn the experience... OVERALLL: things were going well for this wheat--which is much better than Sam's cherry lambic--until I actually tasted it: a medicinal introduction, a drag of an aftertaste, and not really much to savor in between....","dacrza1","Jun 18, 2014"

Has decent cherry aroma, with slight wheat aroma. Too low of alcohol content for me. When I have a beer, I like some what of a kick. Cherry Wheat did not have much of one. To sum it up, I'll probably drink it again if offered, but not too often or any time in the near future.","PhillipTurner","Apr 09, 2014"

Crisp with a good burst of cherry flavor. Lightly hopped as it should be. My SA favorite and one of the reasons I started homebrewing. I've been drinking this beer since 1995. When you get a good bottle (very crisp finish and tart cherry flavor), this one is hard to beat. However, over the years, they have had quality problems. The last few years they have been more consistent.","tillmac62","Oct 04, 2013"

There's not much balance to this, and while this *could* be refreshing, it would have to be pounded to avoid the cloying sweetness from creeping up to room temperature. Really weird stuff - I actually love cherries (and krieks, even those that are sweetened), but rather than being dessert-like or robust, this tastes unusually artificial and candied. I might as well get a cheap wheat beer and fill it with homemade cherry syrup (in the same vein of Berliner Weisses). I'm starting to wonder by now if ANY wheat beer infused with fruit flavoring is worth my time. We shall see, until my palate gives up.","magictacosinus","Jul 09, 2013"

They should have made it a Berliner weisse. It may have been a little more tart then, but at least it would have a clean, refreshing flavor.

I had it on tap, into a pint glass and it was one of the better beers I have ever had. The appearance is like a light weizen, not red like I expected. The smell is beautiful with a bright cherry scent. The taste is brilliant cherry - as I said sweet, but not overbearing. The mouthfeel is nothing special, not bad, but nothing to write home about - definitely nothing left over but a great taste.

Aroma dominated by cherry juice, wheat and a hint of biscuit malt. Flavor is light wheat, bready malt and cherry juice. Cherry is not as dominating as in the aroma. Finishes dry with light hops and sour cherry, slightly astringent. Nice medium body; surprising light creaminess for a low ABV wheat beer. I liked this better than I thought I would, the initial flavor is well balanced and different. Finish is a bit unbalanced and sharp. Interesting.","LiquidAmber","Nov 17, 2012"

3.52,12.1,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"The beer pours a surprisingly yellow with only a slight oranging to suggest the cherries. I sits in the glass as a murky gold with some nice bubbles of carbonation. The beer pours with a nice white head but this mellows down into just a scrim, though it does regenerate when agitated. Lacing for this beer is negligible. The beer smells like cherry coke. The cherry is far too sweet and cloying for natural cherries, but reminds me of a maraschino cherry, which is a nice smell. I’m not expecting this to be the most natural beer, but the candied smell is definitely intriguing. The malt body, hops, and yeast are all overpowered by the cherries except for the smallest ghost of a suggestion of biscuitiness. The beer tastes like a bready cherry cola. The aftertaste is well built with buttery biscuit and only a faint cherry sweet that goes slightly vegetal. The initial sip, however, was heavy with sweet cherries, though the very initial taste is surprisingly heavy with the biscuit malts, but the cherries quickly wash them away to suggest cherry cola. Mouthfeel is a little prickly with the carbonation, leaving a slight tingle, but thick and creamy in the initial sip which that mellows into a watery feeling. The mouth is left with the cloying feel of sweet cherries but little of the flavor and a slight dry burn on the back of the tongue which tingles beneath the light trickle of saliva your mouth works up. Overall this is a strange beer. Its smell and flavor are actually quite good, but the mouthfeel really pulls it back in scoring. It is actually quite good for what the company was going for, as this is a refreshing and tasty fruit beer that is easily mass produced. I compare this more to a cherry cola than to a beer, and I really wouldn’t drink a lot of these due to their cloying nature but one on a hot summer day is not a bad thing to sip when you are looking for something a little different.","Maxwell","Sep 13, 2012"

Smell was a bit of some dulled cherries and some yeast. Nothing remarkable. Taste was pretty decent. I will preface this by saying I grew up on Michigan cherries and enjoy that tart over the top taste. That being said, I didn't get the medicine taste as others have pointed out. A definite fruit beer that IMO is a good combination and quite drinkable. Feel was a good bit of carbonation and medium body. Overall- I think it a pretty good effort from SA. I like the tartness and blend of the hops that evident. Probably need to really enjoy cherries for this one to go down smoothly.

This beer doesn't have good drinkability, not that smooth with the high sweetness and medicinal flavors, one is more then enough for me, there's no way I would want another. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, if looked pretty nice and had some good head retention along with a nice color. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness and the artificial cherrys in the flavor and aroma, to me they hurt this beer and were not enjoyable. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own and I hate when they throw this in their variety packs, when they do it's always my least favorite of the pack, I don't recommend this beer, there's much better fruit beers out there. I wasn't impressed with this beer and never have been, but for some reason this beer appeals to a lot of people so there's no chance of it changing anytime soon. If I am in the mood for a fruit beer, I would much rather have a Short's Soft Parade, I think it's a far superior beer. This beer just isn't for me, hope the next one I try from you guys is much better.","StoutHunter","Jun 14, 2012"

Smell is very cherry with light wheat malt twang and a touch of breadiness. Taste is not bad with a strong dose of cherries and mild bitterness, a touch of a metallic edge that lingers in the finish . Feel is light with a nice amount of carbonation and quenching dryness. Overall a decent beer. If you like cherry flavors this is better than decent. It brings the taste and drinkability of a good summer quaffer with the cherries driving the beer bus. Worth a try either way as it kinda grows on you if you like wheat styles like hefe or wit.","scootny","May 01, 2012"

It smells very strongly of black cherries, it really dominates on the nose but you can pick up other smells like brown sugar. It drinks just as it smells, black cherries. The taste isn't as strong as the smell but the cherry flavor is still dominant. It also has some light grain and wheat flavors. This beer has a surprisingly full mouth feel, its not the ideal beer to drink a lot of but the texture is all there. It has a dry and cherry flavored aftertaste which is really take it or leave it to me. This is a decent offering from Sam Adams, certainly not their flagship beer. Its decent for what it is and is good enough to spark some interest in the style for me.","TwelveOunces","Feb 25, 2012"

Flavor contains more of the same as the nose, but also a faint finish of herbal hopping at the very end. Body is somewhat thin but carbonation is alright. The main flaw in this beer that I can pick out is that the cherries are right up on the edge of getting too cloying sweet / cough syrup in nature...","WastingFreetime","Feb 16, 2012"

The brewers at the Boston Beer Company really should have used fresh cherries only, and not included natural flavorings in this brew, as it could benefit greatly from the melding of cherry and wheat tartness that would likely result. As is, it's just a tad too sweet, and the natural grainy tartness of the wheat clashes with the sweetness of the cherries and cherry flavoring.","mrfrancis","Jan 07, 2012"

3.65,16.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer looks good. It leaves a fair amount of lacing and foam at the top, and lots of little bubbles rise to the top. The bubbles are hard to make out because the beer is opaque which is surprising because of how light gold the color is. The smell is unlike anything I've had in a beer before. It's crisp, light and hoppy, but the biggest characteristic is the cherry sweet smell like juice, but it isn't a dark cherry. More like rainier cherries. The taste is pretty simple. There is malt-cherry sweetness and the other taste associated with cherries: a tart quality. It's a very accurate, and rich cherry taste (like cherry pie or cherry liquor) and not at all like a artificial/candied flavor. Extra points for nailing the "cherry" part of the beer, although the beer gets sour the warmer it gets. The mouthfeel is above average. Smooth enough, but the beer really is as light as it looks.","nicksta","Nov 25, 2011"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of solid white foam. The nose tries to hint at a bit of dry wheat, but things are thoroughly dominated by a half-medicinal, half-artificial cherry smell. Not exactly my bowl o' fruit, so to speak. The taste intimates toward a wheat-y revolution, but the malevolent iron fist of the cherry junta maintains a constant vigil, keeping any subversive characters under an ever-present threat of violent reprisal. Worse, a mineral-y, tinny flavor caps things off at the finish. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a decided miss. the cherry character just doesn't work at all. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Apr 15, 2011"

The taste and the smell are just bombarded with cherry's, the taste even more than the smell. It's almost to the point where you don't want to drink it, but at the same time it's just cherry's, so it isn't THAT horrible.

The aroma is of cherry life-savers or jolly ranchers dropped in a domestic light beer. Hops are hidden in the nose. The mouthfeel is smooth and round with a medium body. The taste opens with a whoosh of sweet cherries, followed by a lingering sweetness, a very mild bitterness in the finish and just a touch of woodsy malt husk. Goes down easy. It tastes sweeter to me today than it has over the prior years. I suspect some recipe tweaking over the years. Overall, it's a decent dessert beer, but it's quite sweet so 1 or two of these is plenty.

It pours solid amber, perhaps with hints of a cherry color, with a solid head you would expect from a wheat beer. There is no hinting cherry in the aroma. Cherry is the aroma, which is actually a perfectly natural breeze of strong cherry scents. I do feel as though I am sticking my nose into a bag of fresh cherries from my farmers market, rather than a big whiff of cherry grenadine or something of that nature. Unfortunately for me, the flavor profile doesn't deliver in quite the same way. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, if slightly watery. And the carbonation is a little aggressive for me. The cherry flavor and sweetness are very one note and reminiscent of a cherry 7 up, which isn't a positive factor for me. The commercial description mentions that they added honey for additional sweetness. It wasn't necessary. Overall, this beer is a little too cloying for me to consider drinking more than one. This is sad, because the use of Traverse City cherries earned points with me before I ever even tasted it.","GregoryVII","Jun 02, 2010"

I had to ask my waitress for a different beer as I could not actually finish this beer. I was thinking maybe the bar I was at (stone face tavern ,abq NM) had served me yet another stale or spoiled beer (unfortunately a common problem with beers on tap in Albuquerque bars) but then I read a review from another guy on BA who said the same thing!

This is better than average, but not quite up to the sublime cherry nirvana that is achieved by New Glarus. With some work, this beer could be great...

The smell is all cherry, perhaps a smidgen of strawberry, vanilla, and almond. As the beer settles, there is some grainy wheat hints that pop through. This is a moderately carbonated, light bodied, fairly simple beer that just smacks of cherry and not much else. Cherry soda is not far off the mark with this one. Hops? I'm still looking for them. I've had plenty of Lambics, and this one is just not in the same league. It's an okay, somewhat change a pace type beer, that is a novelty. Would I buy it or try it again? No, but that does not mean it isn't worth a try. I wouldn't go particularly out of the way to find it, however. The aftertaste is thin, and it really has a pretty flat finish.

Nice cherry taste without being too overwhelming or sweet, but still present. Sweet malts and hops follow behind, but the cherry flavor will be the most memorable taste. Only downfall of this beer is that because of its sweet nature, it's drinkability is severely decreased. Would not be able to get more than two down in one sitting, let alone session with it.

Somewhat dry but also a bit watery for a quenching libation that finishes with a tasteful tartness. Nothing very complex and easy to drink many.

The flavor again seems to be all about the cherries which in my opinion are way over the top. It almost has a cherry coke flavor to it. If you thought the nose had a strong cherry presence, you havent seen anything yet! I suppose that some folks might enjoy such a brew but the cherry flavor seems to be way out of balance with a slight artificial taste.

It's a pale color when a foamy head and is slightly cloudy due to the less-than filtered wheat style, I'm assuming. Looks good. Smells really delicious, like a fruit beer should, and was appealing to those who aren't beer purists in particular, as it smells legitimately fruity. I dug the aroma of cherry's being so strong and not seeming too artificial. The taste tough - up front its good, but right away I taste medicinal cherry cough syrup. I can't taste anything else after that, either. It's tart and not a sugar bomb, but not noticably hoppy...It's hard to want to call this a beer to be honest. You'll love it or you'll hate it as is. Not all that beer like, which is not necessarily a negative. But in taste alone (thinking of it as a desert drink), I couldn't enjoy this. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, not watery or light-beer like, but nothing full as other wheat beers. I wouldn't drink this again honestly...unless there was absolutely nothing else around, and I imagine there would be long periods of time between sips to help me forget just how medicinal it is, only to take another sip, remember...and not come back to it for a while or put it down unfinished.

The cherries tasted much more natural than they smelled, and although it was definitely the dominant flavor, it did not overpower the beer. The finish was very mellow and silky.

On the flip side, it is somewhat drinkable, as the sweetness is controlled enough to be crisped a bit in the finish, making it refreshing, in its way.

The flavor is a little bit of graininess and wheat taste and a lot of cherry. The hop bitterness combined with any acidity from the cherries gives the beer a nice balance. By the smell I expected an overlysweet brew, but found something more balanced than I expected. No real hop flavor to speak of, but that was expected. The carbonation was moderate, body was medium-full, and had a nice smoothness. Overall I thought this beer was great. The handful of times I've entered the fruit beer realm I often left unsatisfied, but this one is a keeper. The aroma is wonderful, especially if you like maraschino cherries (which I do).

Poured from a 12oz bottle the beer itself was a amber color, darker than most wheat's, with slight red and orange hints. The head was a large(3/4 inch) creamy white(slight pink hints also present) that took a while to diminish. Lots of white lace left from the head...all around the edge of the glass. This beer almost does not smell like a beer. It is exactly what it says a cherry wheat....there is a strong smell of sweet cherry(lots of cherry and I can't stress that enough), and lots of sweet malt. The beer itself is not nearly as sweet as it smells. There is a lot of sweet malt, and cherries present in the forefront of the body. But it finishes surprisingly crisp with just a light bit of hops to balance it out, and a tartness from the cherries. For something that could be so sweet...Sam really knows how to balance his beer. Sam Adams does wonders with this beer. the smell is over the top, and the taste toned down enough to complement it. It appeals to multiple senses at once. The beer has ample carbonation creating a pleasant mouthfeel, and for a fruit beer it is surprisingly drinkable. Maybe I should put a disclaimer on this....I don't mind sweet beers, and this time of year fruit wheat's are great in the hot southern weather.","jameaterblues","Apr 06, 2006"

Even though I love the kriek lambics and other cherry drinks, this one turned me off. The flavor was more of the same. If I could have seperated the cherry flavor and the wheat flavor they may have been good...but some some reason together remind me of a medicinal syrup. A little bitterness to help mellow it out.

Okay so the cherry will hit you right up front. But after this subsides there is a pretty good malty flavor. Actually a delicious maltiness, very earthy and strong. The cherry plays pretty well with it too, if only it tasted a little less like marichino and more like pie filling cherries. As far as fruit beers go this is the second best one I think I have had. Mouthfeel is unassuming and light, maybe a little warming, but i don't know how at 5.2%. The beer is an okay one. I'll warn that if you don't like fruit beers, you won't like it.

Pretty well all about the cherry here. Flavor is more wheat central than the nose. The fruity cherry sweetness hits up front, but fades behind an almost heavy wheat character. It has a light bitter to light astringent character on the finish. I'm torn between this being a very mild hopping or an astringent grain quality. Its not very pleasing either way. Feel is moderate with a very velvety carbonation, giving it a nice creamy character. I'm just not sure what I think about this one. I like the nose a fair bit, as the wheat and cherry blend well, but the flavor is just a bit off to me. The grainyness is too strong and that finish is not working.

4.48,42.7,3,5,4.5,4,4.5,"I picked up a sixpack of this for the holidays. When I read the label I was really excited. I could try a wheat beer from a company I know makes decent products from high quality ingredients. I had a really good experience with the first wheat beer I tried (Blue Moon Belgian White), and it had cherry in it to boot. It sounded perfect. When I actually tried it I was kind of disappointed. This may be made with wheat, but it is definately no Belgian style White. It was almost as heavy and bitter as Regular Sam Adams Lager. Anyway, since I haven't poured one out of the bottle yet, I rated the appearance at 3. I'm sure it is probably a decent looking brew, but until I know for sure its rating will be in the middle. When I do get around to pouring one in a glass I'll edit this review. Smell is pleasant, with some fairly strong but very clean malt, and of course cherries. Taste disappointed me at first since I was expecting the cherry against a background of light citrusy wheat beer instead of the rather heavier malt flavor strong enough to be typical of the regular Sam Adams Boston Lager. Still, on repeat samplings, the cherry blends nicely with the richer sweetness of the malted wheat. It's pleasant with rather weaker hop presence than either regular Sam Adams Boston Lager, or Sam Adams Light either. (This beer pluse those two represent my entire sampling of Boston Beer Co's products at this time) Like you'd expect from this company, even the relatively bland hops in this beer are still high quality. They fit the beer and they bring only good things to it, even though the cherries really main contributors to the flavor aside from the malt. Mouthfeel is very pleasant being a bit lighter than regular Sam, very similar to Saranac Lager. Drinkability is excellent. It gets a tiny bit thick towards the end, but its thirst quenching, easier to drink than regular Sam Adams, and seems to be improve the more I sample it. And it also seems to pair well with almost anything. I've had 3 different beers with pizza, chips and dip, and buffalo wings and each time it went great with the food. In conclusion, this very pleasant and fairly unique brew that's definately worth a try.","casualbeerman","Dec 31, 2005"

This beer did not have the residual bitterness noted in other beers of the same type - in other words, this to me seemed more on the lager than on the ale side.

Upon further aromatic detction however i found the aroma to contain a bit of wheat like malt and a lot of artificial smelling cherry. The flavor is a lot better than the aroma as the cherry flavor is a lot more subdued than the aroma might let on. The flavor begins with a tight melding of cherry, carbonic bite, and dry wheaty malt. It soon segues into just malt and leaves a cereal taste almost like cheerios to linger in the mouth. The body is way too light and this beer could use a little higher mash temperature. The drinkability is quite subjective and personally i would go for an Apricot ale from Pyramid instead of another cherry wheat as it is a bit too soda-like and is definetly a beer for those who don't like beer but like alcopops.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 06, 2004"

There is no doubt whatsoever that there is cherry in there. The taste is divine. Alot of cherry at first, then it subsides to a maltiness which then gives way to a very nice toasted flavour.

Aroma reminds me of watered down cherry flavored cough syrup, or maybe kool-aid, theres some wheat malts giving an overall sweetness in with the flat cherryness that seems artificial to me. A powerful nose as it warms but seems almost to much and a bit artificial. Taste is sweet malts of wheat, pale and soft, with a kick of cherry tart flavor thats a bit to sweet and again comes across somewhat artificial and syrupy. A little hard to get past the cherryness with a bubbly carbonation and lighter feel that nearly makes it champagne-like. As it warms it becomes alot easier to handle and makes for a nice drinker but I don't think I'd have alot of this before the flavor starts to get old.","tavernjef","Oct 29, 2003"

3.28,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"when i first heard about this beer, i emailed the sam adams web page to ask if the cherry flavors were all natural, and they replied that they use all natural ingredients. being naive, i believed them, and bought the beer without first examining the labels on the six pack. sure enough, i get home and the label reads something like "with natural cherries and cherry flavor added" (i'm paraphrasing). which means they are most likely stretching the word "natural" to its utmost limits. the cherries smelled and tasted like cough medicine, artificial to the core, which is a shame, because the beer has a great-tasting wheat background, that, if combined with more subtle, natural-tasting cherry flavors, would have resulted in a great beer. as it is, though, it seems as if sam adams is either stretching the truth a bit with their claim of all natural ingredients, or has somehow made real cherries smell and taste like red kool aid with cough drops swimming in it. a real disappointment, but then again, i've tasted far worse. i'd choose it over most macros, but wouldn't recommend drinking it if you can help it.","dedalus","Sep 12, 2003"

What makes this beer near untolerable is the rush of cherry extract that becomes cloying and not drinkable or enjoyable like candy.

There is also a very clean beer taste here. Look, wheat beers are supposed to be hazy. They are supposed to taste like wheat malt; not pale ale. The mouthfeel is good. The body is very light and it drinks easy. Again, wheat beers are best when they are left alone.

Tasted I'd say 3/5000 too sweet. Just a little sweeter than I thought. Had to mark points off for that. But hey, the wheat is detectable on the palate, as is a little yeast. That suited this beer. But then the cherries are detected. Hmm, didn't like it. I don't like cherries, so excuse my bias. The cherry flavour seemed a little like childrens' cough syrup. Damn. But that's okay.

The flavor shows more promise. Lots of cherries again, but backed up by a generous amount of wheaty/malty character, especially for a medium-bodied beer. Hop bitterness makes it crisp and clean.

The taste is more even than the smell, with the crisp grains melding rather nicely with the cherry flavors, which are a bit more tart than those found in the nose. Tastes more like a wheat beer as the cherry taste fades away into a rather crisp, dry finish. A more complex flavor profile than one finds in many fruit beers. Mouthfeel is stickier than in typical wheat beers, and the strength of the cherry scents and flavors likewise makes this beer less appealing that most wheats.","BitteBier","Jan 19, 2003"

The flavor has a good combination of fruit and sweet, very lightly caramel malt. 	It does develop a somewhat medicinal, cherry cough drop flavor after a few sips. There's very little bitterness and yet it doesn't seem cloying; although it does seem to coat the tongue (must be the combination of residual malt sugars and extract flavor).

3.32,5.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The aroma is the best part of this beer. Very fruity smell. The cherry taste is good, but not overbearing. A refreshing beer.  I'm good for a sixer to two of this every year.  Any more than that and the cherry taste gets a bit much.","proc","Apr 25, 2002"
3.65,16.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"One of my favorite beers. Pours a nice reddish-brown, and the smell is delicious. This definitely isn't a beer that can be drank in mass quantities; it's more of a "sippin' a few with the boys" beer, or a dessert beer. The cherry taste is definitely present, but is not overwhelming. I have found this to be a beer that people either love or hate, and I love it. Definitely worth trying.","IrishRedRock","Apr 23, 2002"
3.92,24.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Hazy golden color with a large white head, lots of lace.  Aroma is dominated by tart cherries and wheat undertones.  Taste is very crisp and refreshing, tart cherries and alcohol come across strongly, a touch of bitterness at the end.  Crisp and refreshing, a very nice summer beer.","Pegasus","Apr 07, 2002"

3.47,10.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Again, a nice change-up, but I doubt I'd purchase this again.  If I am looking for a light-hearted, drinkable brew, I'll stick with some sort of hefeweizen","cokes","Mar 21, 2002"
