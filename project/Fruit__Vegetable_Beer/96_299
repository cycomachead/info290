Pairs extremely well with food and is and ideal summer beer.","Bezy901","Dec 12, 2014"

Nice biscuity crispness at the end. I wouldn't buy a 6-pack, but I'd get it at a bar again. Pleasant but not particularly unique to me.","PostRockandCats","Dec 10, 2014"

3,-11.5,,,,,,"Poured a clear golden body with a one finger bubbly white head that quickly receded leaving no lacing. A fairly boring looking beer. Scents of sweet raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, peach and light berry perfume. Overall impression of flavor is of a very fruit-forward beer, no other aromas are present. Very sweet and fitting a fruit beer, but a bit lacking in balance. Flavor begins lightly sweet and fruity with notes of peach, raspberry, lightly sour strawberry and not much else. Middle is slightly drier with the same flavors present. Finish is lightly dry with the same flavors present, but with light grainy malt in the background. Aftertaste is tart berries quickly giving way to grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very fruity beer that is balanced mostly towards berry flavors, with malt most apparent on the aftertaste. It isn't as sweet as the nose let on however and is pleasantly dry on the finish. Better than expected. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and an effervescent slightly chalky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very drinkable, light beer, refreshing and crisp. Overall this isn't a bad fruit beer. It has a rather pleasant sweet aroma, leading into a nicely sweet beginning flavor with a slightly dry finish aided by a crisp mouthfeel. It is refreshing, not at all cloying and fairly well done.","Auraan","Dec 08, 2014"

I feel like this beer is underrated on here because it has three characteristics that people on BA tend to dislike: it's a fruit beer, it's mass distributed, and it's made by Magic Hat. While not an amazing beer, it's certainly better than average. The point of rating beers on BA is to consider a beer within its own genre...and as far as fruit beers are concerned, I think this one is damn good. If you don't like fruit beers, it should be no surprise to you that you won't like this one.  If you think it's uncool to drink Magic Hat, either because it's mass distributed or because of the West 6th thing...then don't drink it.  Anyway, now that I'm down off my soapbox, the flavor of this is rich, and the apricots definitely come through, refreshing pretty much any time of year.  The color has an inviting orangish hue which I find very appealing.  Mouthfeel isn't awesome, a little heavy on the carbonation.  Overall, a pretty good beer.","MarkQ617","Jul 22, 2014"

This has all the markings of a serviceable, mass-marketable fruit beer, which is probably how it has managed to become so widely spread (even available in Canada) and long-lived in the marketplace. At $5 and change for a 4-pack, it's a bit of a steal from my perspective, but it's still not something to go out of your way for.","thehyperduck","Jul 15, 2014"

3.58,5.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"This is the beer the put magic hat on the map and for good reason. They're right by calling it a not quite a pale ale, as the color is more of a paler amber if you will. The smell is floral and fruity and this matches the taste. It goes down smooth with a faint fruitiness mixed with the malt flavors. The fruit flavor is apparent but not overwhelming, especially not present enough to be considered a "fruit beer" in my opinion. Overall it's a good refreshing beer for a hot summer night.","newaquarius","Jun 18, 2014"

The smell is rich with grains. The taste is rich and smooth. #9 goes down with and smooth with a clean finish. There is a slight bite at the end of this brew. The bite is nothing over powering. #9 is a well balanced brew nothing over done in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jun 08, 2014"

It's a little hard to describe what makes it so popular but I think it's that it has a lot of complexity without being overwhelming. I think Magic Hat has been a "gateway" craft beer for a lot of folks and I think its successful balancing act may be why.","ferociouswalrus","Jun 01, 2014"

A faint pale ale with semi-sweet taste, too foamy, and distinctly cheap. The "Magic" is that they are still making this.","TwoLips","May 07, 2014"

The nose is also of apricots with a dash of malts and honey. While the mouthfeel is a bit thin the pallet is rather crisp, so perhaps this is intended. Crisp, slightly malty, and mildly sweet, this beer is simple but very refreshing. I could definitely see myself throwing back a couple of these while hanging out at a BBQ or at a pool on a hot day. It's nothing to write home about, but it's great for what it is.","SylviaFaye","Feb 10, 2014"

Active carbonation in a hazy amber body. Light spicing with crisp ale front palate. Hints of malt and cream mid-palate. Very wet mouth feel with crisp back palate hopping. Very smooth ale taste with hints of Western US style hops complement the overall amber North East Pale Ale crisp hop notes. Enough copper to let you know it's an ale. A little bumble gum and ester on the aftertaste. Caramel and sugar nips away as the taste gently fades. Soft lingering spice. Lots going on here. Nothing over the top. Nothing all at once. Very subtle overlapping notes. Easy to pass up if you just gulp it down (after all it is very drinkable despite the slightly higher than average ABV for the varietal). Nice warming notes result. Overall a solid brew with non-traditional aspects in an otherwise well layered Ale. 3.5 out of 5. Good. When I got to the second glass the apricot fruit notes really came through. Looks like this becomes more apparent the colder the brew gets. Apricot jam and pectin like, but still very drinkable.","digitalflood","Nov 07, 2013"

Smells like ripened fruit, but it is more of an artificial smell. Beer is very well carbonated with a malty taste. You can taste the ripened fruit, but it taste like artificial flavoring. There is only a slight hop bitterness at the end that quickly dissipates. This is a good beer for drinking on a hot day but not one I would particularly want when I have a beer craving, especially a hop craving. It just doesn't bring it all together well.","jngrizzaffi","Jun 06, 2013"

Smell is of clean malt and some sort of artificial-seeming scent, perhaps this is the apricot I keep reading about. Taste is smooth and clean, not as crisp as I'd like a pale ale to be. That odd sweet flavor comes in and blurs things around, seeming to change places every sip. First it's in the front, then it's in the aftertaste...this beer is drinkable, but I don't know what it's trying to be. I can understand the cult following it has though; it must seem like a super-complex ultra-craft beer to macro drinkers.","BurgeoningBrewhead","May 03, 2013"

Thin off-white head dissipates to islands of foam and a ring around the glass with light lacing. Aroma dominated by apricot and peach with slight sweet malt. Flavor follows aroma, light sweet malt and apricot and peach juice with light hop bitterness. Finishes with residual bittering hops and light fruit juice, very slightly sour. Light bodied. An interesting fruit flavored ale that could use a bit more hop and malt character, but the fruit sweetness is deftly done and it is a refreshing, lightly fruit flavored beer.","LiquidAmber","Apr 08, 2013"

The aroma consists mainly of the added fruit flavors (apricot) and the hops.For the taste, #9 is a decent pale ale with the fruit infusion. In my opinion, it is not overly sweet/cloying as some have claimed, nor does it taste overtly artificial. It's a very light beer that can be quite a refreshment if you're in the mood for it. Personally, I dislike many flavored beers, such as Cherry Wheat by Sam Adams, and flavored lambics. (sugar bombs) Despite this, like I said, I enjoy this beer. For many (myself included) this is a great gateway beer to Magic Hat and microbrews in general. It taught me that beer can taste quite different from the BMC staples of American suburbia. Overall this is highly recommended on a summer's day, if you have a sweet tooth, or if you want to introduce someone to craft brewing for the first time.","Neorebel","Feb 20, 2013"

4.2,23.9,4.75,2.75,4.75,4,4.75,"Just tried this on a whim, and was a bit disconcerted when I first opened it. Checked my hands, and the candles I had burning, What was that perfume scent?? It was the beer, and I was thinking, oh, I'm not going to like this. I like things on the line of Fosters Green, Newcastle Brown Ale and the real Guinness stout- a touch of bitterness with some durable body. I don't like frufru beers dressed up with flavors. Glad I tasted it. The nose above the glass is strong of peach scent (not fresh peaches, more like perfume), which is pleasant, but not what I'm looking for. The taste is GOOD, with the aftertaste I like in a good ale, a little bitter, a little lasting on the tongue. The taste has a bit of mandarin orange, NOT peaches, which fits well with the body of the beer. It didn't linger in the aftertaste other than a little citrusy bitterness (which I actually enjoy, I like bitter tastes) or overcome the character of the ale. Speaking of body, a good fullness without being heavy, a little bit of zing, like soda water does. I wasn't expecting an adjunct flavor, but this one, which I perceived as the mandarin, was very pleasant. The only thing that is off-putting to me is the nose of peach perfume when I take a sip. Not fond of that. However, I will buy it again, see it as a good summer beer, and will offer it to my female friends who are reluctant to try a "better" class of beer but aren't fond of the stronger body that a good beer has. And of course, I love the wisdom of the bottle caps, but they've never topped "The devil is in the potato salad"!","bibidiva","Feb 12, 2013"

Pours a murky amber/orange with a thick white head that levels out quickly. It leaves a residual ring of foam with excellent lacing. The nose consists of apricot and mango with a hint of malt. The hops are there too if you look for them hard enough. The taste comes across very fruity with an underlying bitterness that eventually gives way to a pleasant malty finish. It has relatively low carbonation with a slight oily mouthfeel. I am enjoying every sip. I will definately purchase this beer again.","silverking","Dec 21, 2012"

The background flavours are somewhat acrid and unpleasant, as if little thought was given to this other than adding fruit. Body is light but OK. Drinkable enough and probably quite nice on a warm day, but imperfect. Worth trying for the novelty.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 08, 2012"

The malt is there but weak, and the hops are pretty much nowhere to be found. I’ve got to say that I haven’t been very impressed with many beers that Magic Hat puts out. They’re starting to get on a pretty short leash when it comes to buying their stuff. That being said, the beer isn’t offensive and it is drinkable. If given the choice between this and BMC, I’d still pick this.","BlackBelt5112203","Dec 02, 2012"

The nose on this beer is amazingly fruity and floral with hints of stone fruits mixed in there. On the palate there's also a nice fruitiness, but natural-tasting, not artificial. There's a slight apricot flavour and just the right amount of bitterness to balance everything nicely. The mouthfeel is creamy and pleasant.

With that, I'd say it's nicely balanced overall, easy drinking; a cross between a pale ale and a fruit beer (in this case, peach). It's not super-sweet or fruit-like, but the peach tones are there without hammering you too much. For my way of thinking, this is more of a "girl-y" beer with its sweet, delicate fruit-like qualities, but this wouldn't be bad for as a hot summer quencher (in moderation), at least until I could pour some classic pilsner-styled beers.","beergoot","Nov 28, 2012"

Taste is interesting, definitely get a lot of apricot, also tastes a lot like peach. There's a nice malty sweetness in the background as well as a citrus and spicy bitterness to balance things out. Medium carbonation and a medium body make this beer very pleasant to drink. Finishes nice a clean with a crispness to it. I have to say this may not be one of my highest rated beers, but it's one that I keep coming back to. It's so readily available around here and so reasonably priced that it's a really good value for what you get. I also always enjoy drinking it during this time of year (fall).

It's certainly not a bad beer, but it is a bit one-note. Though it's billed as a "Not Quite Pale Ale," it tastes and feels more like a fruity lager to me.

3.35,-1.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The beer pours out like piss. Yellow and murky, almost orange, the beer is practically the epitome of a dehydrated piss colored beer. A thin scrim/head of soapy white bubbles pours and stays as a ring on the glass, but is not too impressive in any way. Carbonation bubbles are quite constant in the glass, and lacing is thin, stringy, and slippery. The beer smells fruity with yeasts and a nice biscuity malt body. There is actually some sour funk in the smell which must be coming from the apricot extract. The sweet side of the fruit smell is at the back of the whiff and is slightly candied. The beer tastes biscuity with nice bread notes from the yeast and a slight fruity tingle throughout the taste. Aftertaste is strong with sweet biscuit malts, and the mouth is left with a little flood of saliva on the back of the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels a little thin but smooth and clean, carbonation is a faint bit too high, but does not detract from the beer. Overall this is an average beer. I hate calling it a fruit beer because it really isn’t, and then again it isn’t really a pale ale either. I guess Magic Hat had it right when they called it a “not quite pale ale,” but that hurts when trying to judge this beer by its style. This beer is a classic of the more mass produced microbreweries, and is very easily sessionable. A nice go to cheap drink for those who want to try it.","Maxwell","Sep 09, 2012"

Aroma of apricots, tangerines, wheat?, a bit of brown sugar, some pine. Flavor follows with light citrus sweetness, only a small bit of bite, and a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is light medium with medium carbonation. Listed as a fruit beer might be a little misleading, while it is sweet and apparently contains fruit, this is more of a light sweet pale ale. Style is between pale ale and summer ale, and has a little spice, a little hops, and some slight citrus. I am curious if they changed things, as others seem to get a lot more fruit character than I do. Doesn't finish as clean as I would hope, but an okay beer overall.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

I wouldn't mind a bit of hop bitterness at the end as long as it's a floral sweet type of hop flavor. Take the apricot flavor down a notch and maybe I can learn to enjoy this brew. Until then, this is something I'll pass up for something better in this golden age of craft beer that we live in.","Philousa","Dec 21, 2011"

3.51,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Reviewed from notes. Easily the most common of the Magic Hat brand found in these parts save for the occasional mixer. Citrus almost pine scent w/a bit of clove honey as it pours into pint glass. Pours a honey orange color with head that's thin and dissipates quickly. Hmmm, very different ale that has a sweetness of apricot added that's mild and not overwhelming. I also seem to get a bit of orange and even a honey like sweetness as it finishes clean. This is definitely mild enough for the masses, I could see the Blue Moon crowds enjoying this easily. Take the mild apricot and fruit flavors away and this would be rather underwhelming, a rare case where the addition/infusion of fruit saves the day.","Blueribbon666","Sep 25, 2011"

Smell is of apricots, peaches, and some sour funkiness. Taste is of apricots/peaches, bread-like malt, and a slight sourness on the finish. A slight funky acidic flavor stays on the tongue after each sip along with a slight bitterness. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

Beer is a not too dark brown. Smells very fruity as others have remarked, smell is quite nice. The taste is initially very fruity and far from a pale ale, but it bites with a bitterness while swallowing that gives it some pale ale characteristics. This beer is also a bit watered down. Mouth feel is creamy but a little too carbonated. This is a beer I could see myself buying again. The price isn't TOO high at $9.63/6 pack (after tax) in Florida, but I have bought better for less. Alcohol content is also very low for an ale, and with the carbonation, you'll find yourself burping a little too often.","NightProwler86","Aug 07, 2011"

It poured out as a copperish amber color with a thin fizzy white head on it. Not much lacing here. The smell of the beer had a fairly strong aroma of apricot and grains. The taste was subtle yet strong enough to know that there really was some apricot in there. The mouthfeel was light and pretty smooth going down, not a huge amount of carbonation in there. Overall, when I first started trying different beers I founf this one to be a real treat. If there was either Guinness or #9 where ever I went, I would have to choose which one I wanted.

If it were me, this beer would have a sour edge to it, and the hops may play out a bit more with the apricot...like an Amarillo hop that would accentuate the flavor of the fruit and still crank up the overall profile a bit.

Nose smelled like apricot preserves and once more, I was thankful for older parents and older grandparents. Both of my grandmothers could cook and both had their own gardens so canning was a frequent activity. Believe me when I say that I know the scent of apricot preserves. Mouthfeel was thin but effervescent. The nose just does not translate to the taste. Yes, it tasted of apricots, but in a small, muted way that struck me as being boring. I hate to say that, but it just lacked any Ooomph! and when I have recently tried other apricot-laced beers that did not lack for flavor, I can only shake my head at this one's popularity.

Taste is fruity (ton of apricots), a bit of hops on the tongue and a residual tartness, sort of the fruit-loop, bubblegum hops spiked with fruit juice. I'm getting quite a bit of a rhubarb taste, too. Feel is effervescent at first, with an oily backing.

Taste is grainy with some faint hop and tea leaf tones up front with a crisp fruity apricot finish. One of the things I like about this beer is the fact that it's kind of a fruit beer without really tasting like a fruit beer. Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied and the drinkability is phenomenal.

This guy pours a mostly clear pale-ish straw topped by about a finger or so of white micro-foam. The nose comprises peaches, wheat, rice, very light toffee, and a smattering of florals. Something akin to a medicinal scent creeps in on the borders, making things seem a bit off. The taste brings this medicine in in the form of an aspirin-like flavor, which ends up dominating things, forcing the apricot, wheat, and hoppy florals to the back (relatively speaking, anyway). The body is pretty light, with an strong moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Overall, something went wrong here. The fruit dies on the tongue, allowing the aspirin to usurp. It's almost as if they gave up on this one.","TMoney2591","Aug 09, 2010"

Tastes somewhat soapy/metallic along with the bouquet of field flowers. Definitely seems like a wheat beer with fruit juices added, we thought maybe peach, apricot, mango.

Very slight amount of sediment visible. Decent apricot scent, kind of artificial smelling. Little bit of a macro-esque corn scent as well. It has that "cheap" scent for sure just covered up with the fruity aromas. I'm tasting less apricot than I would've guessed from the smell, but it's definitely there along with a bit of pear and bubblegum. Slightly bready in the aftertaste. Not entirely bad but I just don't find this taste very appealing. Tastes a little artificial. This is my first time having it in the bottle, I remember on-tap being better than this. Just tastes a bit strange, not very refreshing like many others seem to think. Some hop bitterness is a nice plus here. Mouthfeel is alright for the style, smooth but very thin, good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good too I suppose.

Medium-bodied with its weight dissipating as it progresses forward. The apricot right there, followed on by peach, pear and red apple notes. The carbonation is a bit high, doesn't allow the sweetness to really soak in much. Somewhat leafy, more bitter than herbaceous per se. The malts don't do much to smooth things out, like a malted milk ball without the chocolate coating. Orange citrus blooms close to when it's finally down the chute and retronasally.

Not overly bitter although there is some bitterness. Not real malty. It is a mix of fruitiness and big semi-sweet body. That said the mouthfeel is a little thin but the flavor easily overrides that.

Huge on the apricots but with a decent malt backbone that is not found in the nose. A tiny bit of hop bitterness gives this one a good finish. Mouthfeel is light, smooth carbonation, no alcohol or warming either, doesn't give you a good coat of flavor either, not bad for the style. This beer is very drinkable, probably one of the better session beers out there.

Kind of crisp, kind of acidic. Just lacks the flavors I'm looking for, though. No hop profile to speak of. I'd rather drink apple juice personally, or cider definitely. Both have stronger flavor and less unpleasant sensations accompanying. Mediocrity all the way through. I'm drinking this one because I haven't reviewed it yet, and it came in my winter mixer.

Definite fruit and malt in the nose, but the taste is perfectly balanced without the "spritzer" style fruitiness you get with some similar style beers.

Almost hefe like but a tad sweeter? (After having a few I noticed the bottle said it was brewed with essence of apricot) Good mouth feel. A sweet note, but not a malty one. Very odd but pleasant. A short hop note up front but no bitterness to be had (darn!) Lingers in the mouth a while, a slight oily feel once done. There is something about this beer I can't really put my finger on. It isn't a pale ale but shouldn't really be called a fruit beer either. Maybe an SPA, Sweet Pale Ale? It is a refreshing drinking beer and a tad mysterious as it says on the bottle. If I could get it in GA it would be a semi-regular feature for when I was in a mood for a darker ale but not on a hop bender.

In the nose I'm getting some apricot up front, fairly one dimensional, with some caramel malt underneath. Hop presence is minimal in the smell. The apricot comes through heavily in the taste also. Despite being an extract the fruit seems fairly real, however, the base disappoints a bit. For an APA the malt profile is pretty one dimensional and the hops are only there to provide a backing bitterness and leave me wondering if they really wanted to make a pale ale. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not enough bitterness to give it the kick it needs yet it finishes quite dry with a bit of a slick exctracty fruitiness.

Against my better judgment, I ordered one last night and was summarily unimpressed; actually a little disgusted. While the beer poured nicely and looks pretty enough, cloudy and coppery, it poured with absolutely no head. Its smell was unremarkable, especially for an IPA supposedly infused with fruit. The beer tastes bland and watery with just a hint of an edge of disgusting rancid fruitiness; it completely lacks any of the bitterness or hoppiness that would qualify it as even a pseudo-IPA.

The pour brings a sparkling clear golden / orange hue with nice head formation and retention; mild lacing on the glass. Aromas of sweet malts, fresh oranges, fruity esters, but only a mild hint of hops. Flavors bring out a well-attenuated malt character that dominates the beer because of a lack of meaningful hop additions. Decorated with sweet orange peel, hints of ginger, cloves, and some spicy esters. Apricots it is! These flavors come apart too quickly and lack meldedness, but it seems pleasant enough. The mouthfeel is moderate for a pale ale, but lacks depth, breadiness, and overall heartiness. Finishes sweet and spicy as expected. The sweetness works on you towards the end of the glass, making me switch up to something else.","BEERchitect","Mar 26, 2008"

There was a crisp hop bite on the end, but overall a smooth, silky beer that tasted like an American wheat (not a fruit beer though).

Aroma, right off the bat is hit with lots of fruitiness, especially apricot, a bit of toasty, biscuity malt and a touch of floral hops. On the palate, a mouth filling amount of malt hits you first, bready and toasty still, with that biscuit malt used. The apricot flavor is subtle (much more pronounced in the aroma) and blends well with the floral, citrusy hops which provide just enough bitterness to counteract the malt sweetness. This is a very balanced APA, much less hoppy than most, and the apricot, while some see it as just fruity nonsense, is a nice change of pace from your usual APAs.

The taste is nicely balanced and that is the high point. There aren't enough hops in this brew and the malts are a bit too fruit spritzer for my tastes, but there is the overall balance which adds to the enjoyability and quality of the beer. There isn't much dryness to this beer, the mouth feel is a bit creamy on the tongue, the consistency is light to medium bodied, and the aftertaste is a tad bit peppery and sharp.

Nice dark, hazy gold/orange with thin head that disappears but not before leaving a thin lacing on the side of the glass. Smelled of hops and fruits, with the fruits being pretty present. Strange thing: the taste did not agree with the initial smell. The fruity smell would leave you to believe the drink would be overly fruity and sweet, but the hops and malts are a bit stronger than the mixed fruit. My taste is not refined enough to identify each individual fruit, but the hint is present nonetheless. Great mouthfeel, not too carbonated. I could easily session with these as they are both light and refreshing. Overall, another great brew by Magic Hat.

4.24,25.1,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This has been one of the few fruit induced beers I consistently like, along with Sam's Cherry Wheat. I drink it in bottles regularly and had it here as a pint from a local establishment. A thin looking pale golden-yellow, but it does produce a great white head with big bubbles. You get the apricot aroma right away but it is not overpowering, smells like a fresh apricot with a bready overtone. First mouthful comes on as a pretty watery blend of fruit and wheat/yeast. It's mild and finely carbonated with that unique, tasteful apricot flavor that results in a very drinkable beer. I generally find that I don't like to overdo this apricot goodie as the taste can wear a little thin after a few, but they go done fast and easy, and they really seem to quench your thirst. I can see where not everyone would rave about this, some might think it is whimpy and weak, but I think it does a good job of keeping this in the beer family without the heavy syrupy, champagne like stuff you can get from some of the old school fruit beers. It is watered down, but I think it works. A favorite.","Durge","Jul 14, 2007"

Taste is, like the smell, a bit over the top with the apricot; fruit notes dominate here until the finish which is sticky, corn grit? Like a macrolager. Bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is similar with a creamy start into a light, medium finish and a pang of carbonation. It's a hippie Corona. Drinkable on a hot summer day in the lots, strolling down shakedown.

3.52,3.8,4,2,4,4,4,"Pours a clear 14k gold, with a creamy, one-and-half finger creamy head. Good retention and decent lacing. Tropical fruit and DMS/cooked veggie aromas dominate the rather mild nose; with some pale malt aromatics in the background. Toasty pale malt and some biscuit notes upfront, followed by a flash of ripe tropical fruit. Nice clean bitterness in the aftertaste that balances well with a restrained hop flavor that does not get in the way of the mild fruit taste. Dextrin is more noticable in the end which is not unpleasent, but does combine with an emerging tannic fruit-protien taste, and this becomes distracting. Medium-light body and medium-high carbonation creates a refreshing and light mouthfeel that compliments the apricot pressence. Nicely, done, though a higher dose of fresh apricot could make the fruit character more appealing and fully permeate beyond the rich malt. The stronger malt profile is a welcome change from the fruit beers I have tried, and the fruit profile really opens up in the finsh, achieving a beer that is both exotic-and very quaffable.","PBRstreetgang","May 11, 2007"

After tasting, however, I was pleasantly surprized by the fruity apricot flavor that dissipates into a sharp but nice aftertaste that is not too bitter.

It wasn't much to look at. It had an aroma of malted wheat, malted rice, some sweet dried apricots in the middle, and a dash of white sugar at the end. That aroma was a lot better than the initial aroma that smelled oddly similar to a hair salon. I can't figure out why that was even there. It didn't need to be there. It had a thin taste of malted wheat, malted rice, burnt hops, some peach fuzz, and a few sweet ripe apricots at the finish line. At least it some apricots in it, but they weren't the main dominate flavor. They came in second after the malted grains. The mouthfeel was definitely not crisp and it was way too light and watery with a itsey bitsey aftertaste of apricot and malted wheat. No much going on there. There is only 1 positive aspect of this beer and that is, it's an affordable brew. That's the only good thing! It's sad really.

The finish is smooth, with a small amount of pine tasting hop kick to counter the sweetness with a bit of a bitter after taste. A good balance. Lower on the carbonation rating, which I tend to like, and works well with this brew. Being not a fan of many fruited beers this one is quite good.

I still feel that it is a bit too strong in what i guess is apricot flavor for my tatse but im sure ppl would like that.

The taste is at first smooth and sweet, with the fruit character coming to the front, and then as the taste progresses, the small hoppiness comes to the front and balances it with a light bitter flavor in the end. There appears to be little aftertaste to this beer. Mouthfeel is unremarkable, but satisfying. Honestly, I put down five bottles of this before I realized it, its that easy to drink.

Minimal hops flavor noted, with a mellow malt flavor, almost as if the two cancel eachother out, leaving the apricot flavor that starts out mild, and becomes more pronounced through the swallow.

Was alittle disappoint in the lasting power of the foam which was not very long, it fell fairly fast to just a skim on the surface of the beer. There was some lace, kind of soapy/bubbly in nature. The aromas of this fruit beer were mostly, well fruit, apricots, pears, some apples and maybe berries, I noted some light spices (like the white pepper bite) which was probably from the hops, and sweet malt, but mostly fruit. The flavors mirrored the aromas where fruit (mostly apricots) , dominated, sweet crisp malt, some citrus (hops), white pepper and some grains all intermingled through the whole mouthful from start to finish. Aftertaste was very light and faint - all apricots. I thought this beer was on the thin side so I would say this is a light bodied beer.

When the beer hits my tongue, there is a sugary/honey sweetness first followed with a fruity (berryish, maybe apricot...well, I just looked at the back of the label and it mentions apricot, so that must be it) finishing with just a slight hop that just lets you know its in the beer. I actually didn't know what to expect from this, but I like it. The beer is a moderate light feel in my mouth. Drinkability on this one is high. I could sit down to a 6 of these over the course of a few hours easily.","kmpitz2","Sep 09, 2004"

A few rushing streamers aren't enough to keep it from quickly dissipating, leaving a few crusts of lace. Color is a highly translucent golden orange that looks especially brassy when held to light. Aroma of apricot or peach skins, quite sweet. A bit of lemony? hop emerging, with warmth, high in the nose. Not much of a nosefeel here. Flavor starts with more juicy apricot up front, taking on more of a mango-ish or papaya sensation when swished around on the tongue. Very light, near-pilsnerish maltiness eventually comes through, along with a citrus-rindy flavor at the sides of the palate. Mouthfeel is very wet and smooth--almost watery; just the slightest tingle of carbonation--with a slightly sticky finish filling the mouth. Refreshing drinkability but I reckon the sweetness would eventually bog me down; I would prefer more bitterness.

Although the finish is not completely clean and it's slightly hoppy, the fruity taste (from apricots) complement the entire beer to create a wonderfully refreshing brew.

Maybe it is apricots or peaches. As the malt leaves in the flavor the hops take over and then there is the peaches again. Well worth the effort to drink.

The aroma is heavily dominated by apricot with some subtle, lighter, more syrupy fruit flavors underneath. Naturally, the flavor is similarly loaded with fruit. Never one to mind a little sweetness in his beer, I'm a big fan of the concept -- but I can imagine this one being especially popular. The apricot flavor is true to form with a very dried apricot sense, and the surprisingly crisp finish is not really bitter -- but extraordinarily clean.

Mild butterscotch and faint citric hops are secondary. Unique, but not particularly enticing aromawise. Transiently sharp hop bitterness fades quickly, revealing an agreeable fruit driven combination of sweet, nectar like apricot essence and a clementine citrus hop flavor. Light caramel along with bread and butter notes curface mid palate and linger until cessated abrupted in the surprisingly dry, cracker like finish. Lightly bodied, and appropriately crisp if intended to by a fruity quaffer. Kuods to Magic hat for using a light pale ale as the base for a fruit beer rather than the typical, insipid wheat or blonde ale base. It grew on my palate the more I sipped. The apricot presence remains a notch shy of becoming cloying. Refreshing... a nice change.","marc77","Jun 02, 2003"

Flavor is of immediate sweet apricot, with undertones of honey, but nearly no hops, and definitely no malt. Crisp mouthfeel, a little wet. There seems to be a very faint hops aftertaste, and then that also is overpowered by a sweet apricot aftertaste that overpowers. Too crisp and sweet for me, and not balanced in any respect.","far333","May 31, 2003"

Underlying foundation of grain is complemented--even suppressed--by sweet apricot notes. In terms of taste, the most balanced and appetizing fruit beer I have had to date. (Pyramid Apricot Ale could learn a good lesson in balance from this one.) Smooth mouthfeel with sweet malt and apricot flavors omnipresent but never overstated. Hoppy up front and somewhat dry at the end. A fascinating beer for this type, and one that finally gets it right in terms of maintaining harmony between fruit and ale.

Theres a bit of sweetness and some bitterness at the end, but overall it tastes like I'm chewing on a stick. Not a good experience. The mouthfeel is decent, but I still have that sawdust feeling going on. Drinkability, well let's see. I'll finish it, but I'm glad Loren only brought me one.

A more significant question is; why add the essence of fruit flavoring (apricot) to a beer when it would be a far better achievement to brew the apricots into the beer like a Lambic? I don't know.

That hop quality really brings out the best possible flavor. Not at all bitter like many hoppy beers, but pleasantly dry, refreshing, crisp, all the while maintaining a sweet/tart fruity character that should appease the cosmo and sangria crowd. If you don't like apricots, I wouldn't worry about it because their presence is minimal. If you don't like fruit beers you might want to try this anyway, since you are going to find plenty of American ales that taste just as fruity from the Ringwood yeast. Still, it is very strange that this has become Magic Hat's biggest beer; I guess the sweetness and fruitiness appeals to a large cross-section of people. For a better introduction, and more "beer-like" beer, look to Blind Faith or better yet Heart of Darkness.","Thrasher","Feb 20, 2003"

The combination of flavor and mouthfeel struck me as a bit fruit-soda like at first, but grew on me as the beer warmed. Apricot dominates the flavor, of course, but the wheat is definitely noticeable, and adds a very satisfying dryness to the finish, along with a somewhat grainy aftertaste. I'm definitely drinking this in the wrong season -- it's not a winter beer. Crisp mouthfeel and dry finish would make this a great appertif for a summer barbecue.","mzwolinski","Feb 14, 2003"

It is slightly watery, not very hoppy, not very malty, and essence of apricot is pushing it. If it is going to be an apricot flavored beer then let us have some apricot. If the apricot is to be a mystery flavor (as I guess they want it to be) then bring the malt or the hop flavor to the forefront a little more.
