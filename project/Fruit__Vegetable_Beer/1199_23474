It has a brilliant red color with a vibrant sweet aroma of raspberry. When tasting this it is soft, sweet and a hint of tartness. The sweetness of this beer is not overwhelming in any sense.","MakenziMantey","Monday at 12:02 PM"

Somehow it comes out tasting rather artifical, although in the interests of full disclosure I prefer kriek-style beers anyway. Sadly, in the UK at least, a proper Belgian frambozen is easier to track down and ultimately better tasting too. Disappointing.","interzen","Feb 03, 2015"

4,3.9,,,,,,"Poured a clear ruby red body with a thin ring of pinkish head. A good looking fruit beer, very bright and inviting. Scents of sweet and slightly tart raspberries, raspberry tart and indeterminate red berry flavors. Overall impression of aroma is of a very fruity, raspberry dominated profile that is pleasant, but a bit one note. Still very nice for a fruity beer. Flavor begins very sweet, with strong notes of sweet raspberries and lesser, though still moderate flavors of strawberries and blackberries. A slight sweet malt is in the background. These flavors continue into the middle. Finish is sweet with the same flavors on display, with a bit of an apple flavor also present and a slight acidity. Aftertaste is raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and sweet and grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a sweet and very fruity beer. Those flavors dominate and make this a pleasant and refreshing, but a bit one note. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, slightly tart and juicy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice, light, refreshing beer that is very pleasant. Overall this is a good fruit beer. It is light, fruity and very refreshing with a wonderfully pleasant aroma and nicely sweet flavor profile. This is further enhanced by the mouthfeel. It is a bit one note, like many fruit beers, but it is still good for the style.","Auraan","Oct 09, 2014"

Not overly sweet but not puckering with tartness; a nice blend of fruity aroma and flavors with just enough of a malt/wheat presence to create a crisp, refreshing beer for all occasions.   For a style of beer that is consistently maligned, Founders has concocted quite the pleasant surprise with this raspberry-infused beer.  Would recommend for anyone who enjoys wheat beers or lambics ‚Äì in my mind this seems to cut a middle ground between the two.","Buschyfor3","Jul 31, 2014"

Next to zero head, though a unique deep ruby hue that demanded a longer look than I give most brews. Aroma of clear raspberry (I hope, right?), light citrus, and a hint of malty goodness. Not as much actual raspberry to the taste... quite subtle really. A nice refreshing tart aftertaste. Light carbonation and slightly dry in the mouth (was thinking that it might be too syrupy sweet) and pleased overall. I would not buy this again (even though it was good, not really my thing)... but was happy for the experience. Delicate touch to a beer that could have been a raspberry nightmare.","Mikus","Jul 19, 2014"

For my money, this is the right way to do a fruit beer. I want to taste the fruit if I choose a fruit beer and I want it to taste like real fruit, not artificial. This one pretty much hits the spot, is fairly thirst-quenching, and manages to still feel somewhat like a beer all things considered. If that sounds like your cup of tea, er, beer, then this is one of the better ones you'll find.","Cylinsier","Jul 06, 2014"

Raspberries come off strong immediately in the aroma and hide anything else that might be there. Taste is the same thing for me, the taste is delicious, but I really feel like I'm drinking raspberry juice. I haven't had a lot in this style so I'm not sure exactly what to look for in terms of depth and complexity. Incredibly refreshing however!","Phigg1102","Jun 26, 2014"

It is something like raspberry soda but with less but ample carbonation and the flavor of raspberry is prominent yet not overwhelming. Great mouth feel for this type of beer. I could drink this on a nice tropical day and not get sick of it. Well maybe after 4 of them but i have a hard time drinking 4 of any of the same beer in one sitting.

I was really excited to hear it was being released again and will definitely be buying lots of these 4-packs. That being said the one-dimensional taste and the tiny head that's disappears right away take a little from this beer.","TheBeerDrinker","May 08, 2014"

Really tasty, crisp and refreshing. Great warm weather beer. It's not the most complex and a it loses a lot of typical beer characteristics but I don't think that's the point here.

4.39,14,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Pours an attractive red shade, somewhere in between burgundy and cardinal. A soft pink covering of foam rests nicely on top. The aroma is sweet and complex. While a trace of hops and grains can be detected, the drinker is overwhelmed with ripe raspberry. A tart aspect mixes well with what is perceived to be the malts. The flavor is quite similar to the qualities in the aroma... it is a bit earthy, a little bitter, and is very wine-like. It's got a nice, crisp finish... similar to a fresh cider. Overall I rather like this one, especially as I am not the biggest fan of fruit beers. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys adult beverages, except perhaps those who might not like something that's moderately tart.","Neorebel","Apr 09, 2014"

4.54,17.9,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"A beautiful dark ruby pour with little head or lacing. The nose is of raspberry overlaying a sweet backbone. Almost medium bodied with a carbonation level set to provide crispness and a flavor explosion. The smooth mouthfeel translates to an expertly well balanced raspberry, tart and sweet flavor profile. Raspberry predominates, then the tartness hits the palate and ends on a sweet note. The finish is crisp with a lingering tartness after the raspberry and sweetness fades. Another masterpiece from Founders.","tillmac62","Dec 18, 2013"

Smell is of malt, raspberries, and raspberry juice aromas. Taste is much the same with lots of raspberry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of seed-like earthy bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The taste echoes this simple sentiment, the berries coming through a bit on the sweet side, but not so much as to trigger a diabetic reaction or anything. Moreover, things taste pretty damn natural, not very medicinal or artificial. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. Overall, a very tasty and highly enjoyable fruit beer. No wonder this one is behind the counter...","TMoney2591","Aug 27, 2013"

Taste was dominated by tart-sweet raspberries, some malt sweetness, and showed no hops. The mouthfeel was crisp and simple. This is clearly a fruit dominated drink, and barely a beer at all, but it was good on its own terms.","rajendra82","Aug 26, 2013"

Opens with big fresh raspberry, combined with general berry jam notes, smooth malt, and even hints of vanilla. Very crisp light body, smooth with a hint of syrup and stickiness on the edges.

Full on raspberry onslaught, nothing artificial about it, just pure raspberry like homemade raspberry jam. There's a definite sugar cookie malt sweetness going on underneath which further enhances the fruit, but other than that it's all raspberry. A slight natural tartness lingers on the finish. Just a step behind the New Glarus fruit beers in terms of fruit intensity. There aren't many "clean" fruit beers I enjoy but this is certainly one of them. That said, it's not a beer to drink in quantity but as a nice aperitif or as something fun to pair with sweets.","bump8628","Aug 11, 2013"

This is perfect for summer and a real answer to the somewhat disappointing Cerise, and I liked Cerise. But it was no where near as brilliant as this thing is.

Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry juice, raspberry skin, floral, and light bread. Fantastic aromas with big authentic raspberry notes; and big strength. Exactly what was expected. Taste of big tart raspberry, raspberry juice, raspberry skin, floral, bread, grass, and light floral earthiness. Lingering notes of tart raspberry, raspberry skin, floral bread, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of raspberry and malt flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent fruit beer! Great balance and robustness of authentic raspberry flavor; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 16, 2013"

Flavor is nice and juicy with raspberries, and a light adjunct lager flavor in the background. The syrupy raspberry gives the thin beer a distinct heaviness, but my sense tells me this is the robustness of the fruit, not the beer. Lighter carb and a wet finish. Nice beer.

I mostly smelled raspberries with my beer, possibly some hops and grainy malt but to be honest nothing but razzies for me. I will say that thankfully this beer isn't thick or sticky, and by that I mean the dominant taste profile is raspberry but it's not like drinking raspberry flavored smoothies with alcohol. It is a balanced beer, as there are some hop bites that add crisp, bitter backbite, there is some tart and sweetness, and there is a good amount of raspberry but everything is balanced and it feels more like a beer with raspberries, not raspberry beer. Also, I appreciated the balance because it never gets too sugary/sweet but nor does it get so tart it borders on puckering/sourness. I still gave it a "low" overall score because personally I couldn't drink more than 12 ounces and the pint I had started to wear on me. Pretty good beer that probably is best served as a dessert beer because it is a little bit of meal in a bottle.","clayrock81","Jul 14, 2013"

4.02,4.4,2.75,4.5,4,3.75,4,"So this definitely isn't my style of beers however since its a Founders I'll give it a try. It pours a purple brown, with a purple lace. Very strange looking for a beer. The smell is extremely sweet with an absolute ton of raspberry hitting you right in the face. The taste is more of a raspberry soda than beer, very sweet and a nice tart end. It's actually put together rather nice, which shouldn't come as a surprise from Founders. The feel is a bit syrupy but it does fit with the sweetness. Overall I have to say it has a place. A dessert beer perhaps? Or a summer party. For what this beer is, it's pretty good and will have place in the fridge at he right place and time.","sjones5045","Jun 27, 2013"

4.14,7.5,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I haven't had a Raspberry beer that I really enjoyed, till I had this one, it was a little on the sweet side, but the tartness and raspberry flavors were really nice. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, not filling, refreshing and the flavor did a good job at holding my attention, but the sweetness would prevent me fore drinking a lot of this, I think two would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both really nice and full of raspberrys. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, it was a little high and if it was toned down a little it would help the drinkability. I would buy this beer again, if they choose to release it again, it's priced and right and it's pretty enjoyable, I recommend this to people who like fruit beers and if your a big fan of raspberrys then this beer is a must try. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it did a great job at capturing the pure essence of the raspberry, so far it's my favorite raspberry beer and I like it much more than Cerise, it's got to be one of the better fruit beers I have had. Founders seems to be the jack of all trades, they can do stouts, barrel aged beers and hoppy beers really well and now they proved to me that they have some skills when it comes tor fruit beers, good work guys.","StoutHunter","Jun 20, 2013"

Flavors toss in tart raspberry slurry touch of alcohol presence with realy natural semi swee fruit juice notes, again it's hard to deny the earthy raspberry seed coming through. Mouthfeel is medium bodied crisply carbonated with an assertive sparking raspberry wine dryness left behind on the palate, not syrupy or overly sweet at any time, a killer fruit ale.

This beer pours a mashed raspberry red with a decent 2 inch head that leaves just a little bit of lacing. From the reviews I've read before, the aroma has kind of dwindled off. Crush sweet raspberries with a little bit of pilsner malt. That's all that really comes through. The flavor is much the same. Crushed sweet raspberries mixed with a light malt flavor. Just a slight hint of oxidization which is a bit surprising because most of the older twist top Founders bottles I've had have a heavy layer of cardboard.

Small raspberry and yeast particles float throughout - rather nice to look at actually. Rigorous pour produced a bubbly white head that dissipated quickly. Aromas were tart raspberries - that's it.

There isn't much depth here at all, it's a one trick pony. But it doesn't really need anything else, it does that one trick very well. A little thin in mouth, but that's really it. If you want something sweet and fruity, without being artificially cloying or oversweetened, this is it here.

Moderate body and carbonation. This is a unique fruit beer. One that I believe was made for people that are not keen on the usual fruit beers. This is akin to a raspberry IPA. So, if that sounds like something you'd dig, seek this one out and give it a try before it goes on vacation.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 16, 2009"

There is just a really nice low-key sweetness from the raspberry, but the sourness is what makes me want to keep drinking. Hides the almost 7% pretty darn well.

3.94,2.3,3,4,4,4,4,"Founders Rubaeus is a basic raspberry ale but without any extract flavor and not too much wheatiness. It pours the typical very hazy golden body beneath a short-lived head of dark white froth that quickly subsides to an average collar. The nose is fruity and malty, and malty and fruity... with a decidedly raspberry-tinged character - but it's not slap you in the face, it's much softer than that. The flavor follows suit, and it's malt and fruit up-front, with the most dominant sweet-fruitiness at that point. The malt then steps in and mellows it. A tinge of tarness passes quickly, and then it becomes sweetly malty across the middle and into the finish as it warms in the mouth. Surprisingly, it's not sticky in the finish at all. The balance is very good, keeping the bitterness well heeled, and letting the natural tart sweet fruitness of the raspberry ride and bob across the surface of the slightly honeyish malt base. I'd personally prefer a beer that had a little more of an edge to it, but I can't fault it as it's very nicely balanced for what it is. Worth trying?

Maybe a few minutes after im writing this he may want to tell me what kind of peel he really is. With the nose being fruit covered in sugar, you would expect the beer to be intensely sweet- although its not compared to other styles similar. You would think that constitutes balance, but in reality any nuance that would show is hidden by sheer raspberry RS covered sugar daddies. Give me something more please! I expected more, although the beer is incredibly approachable and ready for dingdongs nation-wide.

A layered tart feel hits the tongue but quickly is joined by a almost creamy lager feel. The sweetness of the raspberries kind of prickles the tongue the height of the palate.

I don't notice any hops or alcohol taste in the beer. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, although I think this is more of a dessert beer.

Poured a very light bright red, almost a pink with very little in the way of a head on top and just the slightest touch of side glass lace. The carbonation coming through was very full and left for chains of bubbles streaming up through the bottom. The aroma was very light and sweet, not really deep raspberries like you see in some others, like Raspberry Tart for example, but a light sugary raspberry, akin to a wine cooler. The taste was very light and crisp with a refreshing nature to the feel. Ample carbonation kept it lively throughout and a decent fruity aftertaste followed. Overall this was pretty decent, nothing spectacular, but still pretty decent. It was a nice novelty one off selection, though I don¬ít think I would go this way again.

The taste is better than expected, given the formidable punch of the raspberry in the nose. The taste of raspberry is omnipresent, of course, but varies between smooth, sweetness in the middle and a pleasantly tart finish. Grains undergird things nicely.

It was very heady, which lead me to believe that it was getting a little old. Mind you, I only bought a bottle from the store and it doesn't have the born on date on the bottle, so I have no idea if it's getting up there in months. The smell was very rasberry and also a little sharp. My first taste was again very heady and somewhat tangy. I didn't get a lot of hops out of this beer and to me it was somewhat wit-like because it had a dryness to it. Predominant taste was rasberries. I also paired it with Ceviche which wasn't a bad pairing. Overall, it wasn't really balanced, it was very heady to the last drop and I'm still tasting it hours later.

Anyway, poured into a Triple Eight Vodka sampler glass (associated with Cisco brewery). Coloration was reddish, with a pink head that faded quickly. Just looking at the head fading made me think that this is one really carbonated beer. Aroma was definitely filled with rasberry, but I could also almost smell the vine that they came off of. The earth factor gave it a more realistic fruit beer characteristic I think. Taste was of tart rasberries, more green earth tastes. It sort of reminded me of rubarb pie in a way (guess that is appropriate considering the title). Mouthfeel was relatively light in body, but very easy to drink. Most of the time when I have Founders beers, I can immediately tell that it is one of theirs. If I was to do a blind sampling of this one however, I would have never guessed it came from Founders.

The finish is clean and crisp with the raspberry lingering for a couple seconds. This is probably one of the most carbonated beers I have tried, which works well for the style and prevents it from tasting like raspberry syrup after awhile like the New Glarus beers, though the raspberry flavor isn't as in your face as the Raspberry Tart either, which I like.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Red grapefruit colour, hazy, topped by white foam with a pink cast. Smells like... raspberries! But still definitely beer. There's a bit of maltiness that comes through in the aroma. Starts with a little malty sweetness, but that's quickly overshadowed by a tart flavour that's not overly acidic. Dry overall with some fruity sweetness throughout. Slightly syrupy texture and ample carbonation. Long finish that tastes like you just finished eating some raspberries. Quite a nice fruit beer, not overly sweet with a good acidity level.","DrJay","Jul 21, 2005"
3.8,-1.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Saw this at Downtown Wine and Spirits yesterday and bought a few bottles. Was disapointed that it was so carbonated upon initial pouring, not sure why it just immediately came out of the bottle and overflowed my glas. so much. There's a good deal left though, so here goes. Actually left pink cotton candy floss on the sides of my glass. Aroma is maybe it's best feature, this one really smells like fresh raspberries. Tastewise, I guess I expected more....I think the rasberries only show themselves in the finish. Upfront there's some malt, and a strange yeastiness (anything wild at all in this one??). It does appear to be unfiltered as colorwise, it is cloudy/dusty raspberry in color. It is tart, I don't really find it that sweet at all. Mouthfeel isn't bad.","PatandDavid","Jul 12, 2005"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Definitely one of the best Fruit Beers I have tried. Bright red color with a thick and lasting pink head. Nice coating of lace too. The sweetness that makes a lot of fruit beers too cloying for me seems to be tempered by the higher-than-usual ABV. Super tart raspberry flavoring with a bit of spice and hops. The finish is fruity and bubbly, with a lingering aftertaste of raspberry. I don¬ít say this often about Fruit Beers but I will surely have this one again.","Dogbrick","Jul 11, 2005"

3.89,1,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability and Notes ¬ñ This is an ok fruit beer, too much fruit for my taste and not enough beer flavor. If you have ever had Purple Haze from Abita, this is much better, but a similar beer. All in all not a bad beer if you have been drinking too many beers and want a major flavor change, or if you just plain hate the flavor of beer.","OldSock","Jun 24, 2005"

3.12,-19,3,3.5,3,3,3,"D- This beer has the big nose of a great raspberry beer but it is missing the flavor. It was really over-carbonated but I don't think that affected the flavor much. It was missing flavors like fresh berries or malt or hops to balance. It just needs something besides sour.","rhoadsrage","Jun 21, 2005"
4.04,4.9,4.25,4.5,4.25,5,2.5,"The mouthfeel ranks a little higher than medium-bodied, which I didnt expect. Very outstanding balanced on the way down.

3.94,2.3,4,2.5,4.5,5,4,"Pours pinkish clear in color leaving a head which overfills the glass then quickly calms down to a film. Looks very carbonated. Smell is of raspberries and toilet water(?). Extremely tart with a punch that leaves a very sweet and tart aftertaste. Carbonation is much less than it appears. A smooth creamy mouthfeel that is becoming the trademark of Founders' products. After a sip it just sort of melts in the mouth with no prickly carbonation. Not syrupy or overly sweet. More tart than sweet. Leaves a tart sensation on the tongue and the liquid disappears. Very drinkable for a 6.9% and fruit beer.","mjohn27603","Jun 15, 2005"
4.13,7.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a rolling wall of dense carbonation. Quite effervescent. An easy drinking beer that would go down nicely poolside on a hot day. Another good one from Founders and a nice change of pace. Well worth a try.","orbitalr0x","Jun 12, 2005"
3.97,3.1,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"The beer pours a deep ruby color with a 3 finger pink head that falls slowly, leaving a lot of lace behind. The nose is big with sweet raspberry with a wheaty beer backbone behind it. I'm not a big fan of the strong wheaty notes. The flavor is also very wheaty. The raspberry is less strong. The flavor is really lacking any gusto. The feel is thick and full, slightly creamy with a moderate carbonation. I get a blast of heat in my belly from the alcohol. The beer is pretty drinkable. The flavor is just missing something in my book.","kmpitz2","Jun 11, 2005"
4.25,10.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a red/pink color with a tall head that falls slowly and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is all fresh raspberries. I can't get much else, but it smells really good. The flavor has a certain emptyness to it across the tongue. Has nice raspberry flavor at the first taste and on the finish, but there's really nothing in the middle. Very odd. Tasty too, but odd. The body has a certain thickness, as if from oats or wheat. Drinkability is very good. Tasty brew.","clvand0","Jun 11, 2005"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,4,3.5,3,"This certainly pulls no punches. It's unabashed raspberries. Not so out-of-sorts as to be compared with things like Leinies Berry Weiss. The attention to the malt end helps elude such a fate. But the manic sugars and lightly cloying nature would prohibit me from drinking more than one. Fans of Lindeman's Framboise or New Glarus Raspberry tart will find a like minded brew. But for me, the wine-cooler element seems underlined here.","cokes","Jun 10, 2005"
3.65,-5.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark purply red, with a huge pale purple head that fell to a 1/4 inch table of medium-bubbled foam. Nose is dominated by fruit reminding me of a frambose lambic without any funkiness. Taste is raspberries, slightly watery, with a touch of berry seed flavor in the finish. Mouthfeel was a thin. There isn't much balance to this beer. The alcohol is not present in the taste or mouthfeel. Easy to drink, but one would be enough. Non-beer drinkers might enjoy trying this.","pentathlete","Jun 10, 2005"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,4,3.5,3,"Logical raspberry aromas arise from a burned burgundy-colored liquid. Fudge and caramel sundae topping and tootsie roll aromas beef up the bouquet considerably. It's a dry moutful of dusty red fruit tannin, dense malt weight (a Founders signature) and vibrant raspberry fruit flavors. A dry, crusty caramel-flavored foundation is obvious. A streak of sweet alcohol flavor joins the finish. Punctuated fruit acidity and bitterness on the finish roughly counterweigh the sweet, plump elements. Another parade of good tasting ingredients from Founders. While it is impeccably crafted and well-proportioned, there are no surpises here. Nothing happens to the raspberry and slo-poke flavors on their way to an admirably dry finish. Though this beer may be a prescription for boredom, the brewers should be praised for their craftsmanship, skill and market sensibility.","putnam","Jun 09, 2005"
4.4,14.3,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Moderately thick, dense, light pink colored head leaves a short sheet of lace. Hazy dark mahongany colored beer with a ruby hue. Raspberry jam aroma with a toasted malt base; almost like a raspberry poptart. Fresh raspberry flavor throughout mixed with mild doughy malt flavor. It finishes just barely tart. Light, fairly crisp mouthfeel. It's like somebody took a piece of toast with raspberry jam and liquified it. I'm usually not a big fruit beer fan, but this one is different from the rest. Thanks to malty for another great brew.","HappyHourHero","Jun 06, 2005"
4.05,5.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This summer offering from Founder's really surprised me. Fruit beers are usually not too great and they are usually either super sweet or super tart, balance is not what I think of when I think of fruit beers. But this had it. Pours an amberish, pinkish girly looking color. A few bubbles to the top with a fizzy pink head. Lots of lacing though. Aroma is all raspberries, I can't get past the raspberries, they smell really fresh though. Taste starts out a little sweet, too sweet but it's not all raspberry sweetness. There's a malty sweetness in there that pushes the envelope a little too much. Right when I'm ready to write this one off though a nice super tart flavor hits me which is most definitely the raspberries in their full effect. A yeasty, alcohol dryness finishes this beer off. Great complexity and balance but I still liked their Raspberry Pale Ale on tap a little better.","granger10","May 28, 2005"
3.49,-9.4,3,4,3,3.5,4,"Pours a nice cloudy red color and extremely carbonation and nice amount of head and but it fades after a minute or two to basically nothing. It almost looks like pop (soda if your not from Michigan :-) ). Smell is quite strong and that of raspberries, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is not as carbonated as I expected but is pleasing and the taste is a little tart and sour. Drinkability is above average and for fruit beer is pretty good.","DrainBamage","May 22, 2005"
4.63,20.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I've had very few good fruit beers, and this is one of them. For those who can't handle the over-the-top fruit mimicry done by New Glarus (which I think are excellent), this might be right up your alley. Fruit flavor is nicely balanced and allows the inner beer shine through just enough. Well suited for a (expensive) fruit beer session. Very tasty, and I'm not surprised one bit. Founders has impressed me yet again.","Skidz","May 13, 2005"
4.11,6.8,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a wonderful fairly clear pink color with a fizzy pink carbonated head. Smell is mainly raspberries, tart, but with some sugary notes present as well. Taste is somewhat malty, some grainy notes are present in the background, but the tart raspberry flavor shines here. The raspberry flavor is definitely real, not sickly and artificial tasting like most fruit flavored brews. This is very nice on the mouth, smooth as can be. Their is a different aftertaste here I cannot put my finger on. Overall all a very nice fruit brew that is very drinkable, but I wonder if I could handle drinking more than 2 of these at a time. Nicely put together Founders.","bnuttz","May 07, 2005"
