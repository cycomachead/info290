4.57,40.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"First discovered this beer at a NY TAP festival. It was my first fruit beer I would say, and has since lead me to try a few others. As I am not a fan of drinking alcohol while eating food (it's usually one or the other, aside from Buffalo wings and football spectator foods), I found this beer to be very drinkable in that instance. It competes well with juice and soda and is by far is my favorite peach/apricot inspired beer.","TheHip-HopMobBarley","Jan 18, 2015"

Aromas of apricot, slightly sour apple, and sugary sweetness. Smells like a candyshop. Flavors are clean and crisp, with a strong apricot charcter in the forefront followed by a roasty grain backbone and tangy apple highlights. The aftertaste is like finishing a Jolly Rancher, with sugary sweet lingering flavors. Crisp, slightly long lasting finish. Refreshing and light, but quickly can bbecome overbearing.","GarthDanielson","Jul 02, 2012"

3.47,6.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"their version of the now famous magic hat number 9. this is not nearly as good in my opinion. pours a very pale yellow color with a minimal white head. smells overly sweet, like apricot jam or preserves, rather than fresh fruit. heavier wheat malt and some hefe style yeast, peppery and zesty. flavor is kind of a combination of all the aromas, with the apricot coming on first, then the yeast, and finally the malt and a different apricot vibe, a bit more tart this time, very front of the tongue. it actually crisps up nice in the finish, and isnt a bad summer drink with its light body and bubbly carbonation. overall though i think ithaca is best at making hoppy beers, and this foray into the fruit side is not my favotite. passable, even good for those unfamiliar with the number 9, but an inferior poser to those in the know. hang me for that if you want, but i stand by it.","StonedTrippin","Jun 15, 2012"

This was not overly sweet, as is easy to do, but rather it was big on the actual tasting notes of the fruit, rather than the general sweetness. These qualities were so robust, in fact, that it started to obscure some of the more desired flavors, like the grain bill, that would have helped to really balance this guy out.","TheBrewo","Aug 08, 2011"

The beer poured a dark golden color with a thin white head which quickly dissipated. Carbonation bubbles flowing and rampant. Smell was sour and peachy.

Huge amount of bubble beads inside the murky dark golden to amber colored liquid, close to fully translucent. Strong apricot on the nose with peach and yellow apple too, soft lemon juice accents, the wheat component is relaxed and hard to individuate, slightly honeyed, maybe the graininess comes out more as it warms. Medium-bodied, smooth and close to soft, only the carbonation adds a steady tickle. Not overly sweet but, again, the apricot is by far the dominant aspect, as supported by pear and peach along with juicy orange and lemon citrus. Moderate dosage of wheat, rye and some biscuit. Dries up sufficiently by the end to achieve balance, this without impinging on the friendliness of the fruitiness. If you want an apricot beer, this should be on the short list.","farrago","Jul 20, 2011"

The taste was very much of apricots, (as another reviewer noted, far more than Magic Hat #9, likely because of the inherent sweetness of wheat ales) and wheat, it really didn't get more complex than its own name! There was a yeasty characteristic to the aftertaste, but it was still mostly fruity. I could detect essentially no hops flavor, and thus no bitterness, but the beer somehow doesn't become overwhelmingly or cloyingly sweet, which I liked.
