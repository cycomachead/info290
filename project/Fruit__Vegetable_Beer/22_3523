This is exceedingly good for a fruit beer, and I absolutely love the crisp mouthfeel - but it's still not my favourite in the Éphémère series. As with most of Unibroue's flagship products, this one has a strong Belgian ale vibe, so if you're looking for something along that line with a decent fruity kick, this is a worthwhile option. I'd get this one again, but I'd still rather drink a good craft cider.","thehyperduck","Nov 12, 2014"

It's probably decent for the style (it is intended to be a fruit beer, after all), but just not my idea of what a beer should be. I'm also not a big fan of the flavor of Belgian yeast. If you like Belgians and/or fruit beers, give it a try.","lwillitz","May 05, 2014"

4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 7/17/2015. Pours fairly hazy pale gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apple juice, pear, white grape, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of apple juice, spice, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of apple juice, pear, white grape, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of apple juice, pear, white grape, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of apple juice, spice, wheat, and yeast ester flavors; with very nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice fruit flavored witbier style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of apple juice, malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 26, 2014"

4.02,11.7,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Poured a cloudy golden color with a two finger fluffy white head that grew before receding into a foam of white, leaving no lacing. It looks quite good for a fruit beer, like a tripel. Scents of green apple, grainy malt, spicy Belgian yeast, faint apricot and wheat malt. A good, fruity, light, crisp scent with the tell-tale spiciness of Unibroue's Belgian yeast strain. Very nice. Taste begins with heavy, fruity apple notes, on the green apple side of thing, and some slight pear-like flavors. This mingles with spicy and earthy Belgian yeast, faint coriander, very faint lemon-like sourness and a nice backbone of sweat and grainy malt, all present throughout the sip. Finish is grainy wheat cracker, apple and spice, as is the aftertaste. A very good flavor profile, not overwhelming or bold, but light and refreshing, yet still quite complex for the style. Very well done. Mouthfeel is light bodied and watery, with high carbonation and a wet finish. Refreshing and crisp, befitting the rest of the beer. Overall this is a very good fruit beer, with a nice Belgian character to give it depth. Its aroma and flavor are crisp and refreshing and the mouthfeel is light which helps the other qualities. Its a good warm weather beer and quite well done.","Auraan","Jan 24, 2014"

Smell was apple and orange, and there are flavors of apple, malt, citrus, and minimal hops in the taste. The beer has a pretty nice mouthfeel (thin, but not too thin and crisp) but also is very acidic, so much so that I could feel it burn my esophagus on the way down. Overall, I think that this is a pretty good beer, as it offers overt fruit flavors while not being too sweet, and it's not too thin. But is it worth the $8 that I paid for a tall glass of the beer?

It's refreshing and crisp with a soft and subtle vanilla note on the smell and palate. You can drink four of these and not feel any bloated, heavy framboise-like, richness on the stomach. At a smooth 5.50% ABV, you don't have to struggle to get through it. Very good paired with meat and potatoes or pasta. Perfect on a summer day in a cold glass. I've only found them in singles or a 4-pack, $2.99 a piece or $10.99, respectively. Unibroue makes fantabulous beer, try the others!","Francis_Matthews","May 31, 2013"

It's reminds me a lot of their witbier with a big apple punch. So I can't get past that and I sure as hell don't get a fruit beer with this. Is it fruity? Well yea, but it has enough wheat going on to be just some old fruit beer. Is it world class? As world class as it can get. A damn fine brewery with an idea and they perfected it. Problem is, that's not much in terms of what it is. I love Unibroue and this isn't a complete waste. It's as good as anyone will ever get with a wheat ale with apples and coriander lol. But that doesn't mean it's an A+ brew either. Just a very good brewery with an idea. I'll drink one in spring, but I won't go out of my way to get it.

3.83,6.4,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,4,"a very well made beer, certainly not for everyone, but unique as fruit beers go, since it isn't super sweet. the pour is hazy and very pale golden in color with a lively white head, fizzy and maybe pushing three inches tall. the nose is fruity like green apple skins, but not the flesh. there is very little sweetness or tartness in the nose, just sort of that apple essence. also a nice light wheat malt base and a fun bright Belgian yeast strain. the flavor is decidedly apple forward, but its like granny smith apples or something, not too sweet, not too tart, nice and clean and crisp. floral blossom apple and hop profile is more robust than anticipated, and it works well to sharpen things up. long curious finish where the yeast takes over. I liked the flavor of this quite a lot, despite what the BA community seems to think. its something different for sure, but it is absolutely artfully made whether you like it or not. awesome feel with upbeat carbonation and a fluffy but delicate texture. it really works, especially in early spring here. seems just right to me.","StonedTrippin","Feb 17, 2013"

The head disappears as you drink, and there was not a hint of lacing throughout consumption. This thing is pungent of granny smith apples. I can smell it being poured, and I am a few feet away. Upon closer inspection, the nose is sour-sweet granny smith apple, with a mild roasted grain backbone that can be found if you dig around a bit. Flavors are completely different from what I was expecting. The backbone is more of a roasted apple sweetness, with none of the tart that I was expecting from the granny smith nose. Slightly acidic highlight throught, with a tree and pollen highlight throughout. It almost tastes like an apple blossom smells, if that makes any sense. The aftertaste is crisp and slightly spicy, with some peppery notes. A bit on the watery side, too, leading to a slightly limp, nondescript finish.

Poured a cloudy dark straw with a small white head, that dissipated quickly, but left some lacing. Smells of green apples and light malt, but the apple definitely dominates. Tastes of a more begium-style malt with hints of sour green apple, but less than what was expected. Goes down easy for a medium style with good carbonation.

The nose comprises green apples (plenty of skin involved here), light pear, wheat, banana, white grape, vanilla bean, and whipped cream. Kinda like certain scented candles I've come across, but one of the good ones. The taste brings in more of the same, with the granny smith apples really coming to the fore. The other fruits and the vanilla are cut a bit, but still make discernible appearances. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky-ish feel.

The aromas of apples lead the way with a zingy hoppiness in the background. The body feels in the light-to-medium range. The taste is also full of apple and yeast but it is also kind of dough-like. There is a sharp sour hop bite at the end. Adequate but not my style.","puboflyons","Sep 17, 2011"

Unfortunately, it does not last long, and little-to-no lacing is left in its wake. The smell is of strong apple juice, sugar, some spice, a bit of yeasty funk, faint straw, and some muddle earthy notes. Taste is of candy apple backed by prune juice. Really, this tastes like carbonated juice and not at all like a beer I've encountered before; all I can think about is an apple Capri Sun that thirsty children would drink during half-time of their pee-wee soccer games. The sugars from the apple and prune dominate everything except a minty, toothpaste like finish. Quite unpleasant. Mouth is crisp and well carbonated, but finishes very sticky and sugary. Overall, this is a very odd beer, and not one I'll be picking up again any time soon.","eclipse54","Aug 26, 2011"

The nose is great (and "tickly") ... apple sweetness to apple tartness with faint coriander on top of other spices. Deep pulls reveal dark berries. There is a ton going on in this aroma, and it's all stellar -- I just don't happen to have the exotic fruit knowledge to help describe what all is there. Flavors are loaded with fruitiness, and they all stick like syrup to the back of the throat. Super heavy carbonation, maybe a little much. Apple tartness and sweet pear as well as berries. Bitterness and dry malty flavors are present. Spicy but also a tad musty. A very unique and complex beer, but not all of it works well together.","washburnkid","Aug 17, 2011"
3.62,0.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light, refreshing, tangy and dry all come to mind on the first few sips. Carbonation is actually not as high as I thought it would be, but is more on the medium side. An crisp apple taste is the main attraction here, but its rounded out by dryer tastes of coriander and lemon rind. Syrupy finish, but dry in the mouth feel. Overall, this is a thirst quencher, and a pretty good one at that. Decent complexity, but probably won't buy it again. Worth the try though.","chodinheaven","Aug 11, 2011"

3.92,8.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Not a cider, but an apple beer. And surprisingly very tasty. Pours a hazy straw-yellow with a thick puff of white head that mellows out after a minute or so. Big aroma of fresh apples and apple skins, and not in a bad / acetaldehyde way. Light grains and herbs in the background. Tart flavor, full of crisp apples; pale malts and light sugars take the edge off a bit mid-palate. Light mouthfeel, and very drinkable.

Opening the bottle the apple aroma is very noticeable but it isn't the artificial aroma in lots of other beverages. It's a cloudy yellow color with some sediment. The taste is mostly apple with some citrus and floral. It's not overly sweet so it doesn't come off as overbearing like many other fruit beers.

The head was a fizzy white, the aroma was filled with apples and yeast, the mouthfeel a little fizzy a little silky. The flavor was complex with hints of apple, pear, lemon, concord grape, some bitterness in the back end. The finish lingers for just a few moments of apple flavor.

Objectively, the beer is decent enough to drink the whole way through and the ABV is low enough say that you don't feel like an alcoholic if you drink it during the day.

Does it make up for what's sometimes a rather thin taste overall? Not always, but this is one that I can (very reasonably)buy, and share during a time of year that is peppered thin with ciders.

It poured light and crisp and was an applesauce in color with a light white head that laced the rim of the glass. It continued to bubble, kind of like Sprite. The aromas given off were interesting. At first it was of sweet apple and had kind of a pilsner tint to it. As the beer went on it smelled more like a granny smith, or a cider, and the coriander became more apparent. The taste too began sweet before tasting a bit sour, and like a granny smith cider. It tasted pretty good. The mouthfeel was very light and crisp. The beer was very, very carbonated and continued to be so. It didn't really dry out like I thought it would. I think that for a single beer, it's very drinkable. It's essentially a cider so I'd say it's better suited for a hot day. It was definitely interesting. It's probably worth a try although nothing too special.","aasher","Aug 18, 2010"

YES...green apple, but not limited to green apple; caramel, passion fruit, oakiness, and some smokiness also come to the fore. This aromatic mix was a little surprising, so I couldn't wait to sip it. In tasting, the apple and passion fruit hits you first, and then dissolves to a surprising mid-palate vanilla/oak/tartness, and then finishes on a sweet/smoky note. Very surprisingly complex for a style of beer which is typically one-dimensional. The feel was very carbonated/spritzy, but fairly thin. In summary, I couldn't help but think that next summer I will stock my fridge with plenty of this, for the long days of working in the yard.

Disappointment creeps in when it comes to taste. Apple notes are extremely subdued; I expected something much bolder. There is a continuing mint/herbal presence on the palate, along with the faintest maltiness. Perhaps some sort of cinnamon/coriander character might have been more complementary here.

I'm not really sure what to think of this. First impression is that the scent of apple is way too overpowering, it's like they are trying to hard to remind you that they made a beer with apples. The taste is also nothing impressive. It tastes like they mixed bad cider with a bad belgian ale and neither characteristic is particularly pleasing.

By the time it got to me it only had a thin head left and was very cloudy and hazy. Very yellow. It really gave off some apple fumes. Apple was the biggest odor by far. Maybe some earthy wheat also. The flavor was overpowered by Apple. More the sour apple flavors associated with cider and not the sweet types. Kind of Granny Smithy, I guess. The other flavor was wheat beer. Spiced cloves and sour apples in a semi-thick brew. It's not bad. It's just unusual and definitely a novelty. Easy going down but not what I'd like to drink all night.","berserker256","Jun 21, 2009"

Strong apple aroma, my wife was feet away of my glass and she asked me "are you drinking a fruit beer?", when I said yes it has apples in it she said "thats what I smell!" So that gives a good perspective of the aroma profile that dominates. Also there is a spicy zest in the aroma that is clear from the coriander, curacao and the yeast that is used. The flavor also has a strong apple presence that gives it a slight tart feeling. This brew does not seem like most wit's as the coriander is not noticeable till the very end. The end seems to be quite dry. Has a nice zest to the feel as it prickles the tongue.

Light-bodied, presence carried almost exclusively by the enthusiastic carbonation. The lemon, orange citrus much more present here, if not an iota sweeter. While decidedly green apple in profile, there's yellow and Fuji apple too. The coriander, cinnamon-led spice washed out some by said carbonation. Straw, hay more sweet than bitter.

If the apple smell was too strong I guarentee I wouldnt have liked it. The taste wasnt too good I thought. It tasted like a very bland wheat beer. There was a nice apple aftertaste, but wasnt really enough to save it. Overall very boring. Mouthfeel was light and somewhat crisp I thought for it not having the highest carbonation.

Pronounced apple flavors live up to the aromas promise, subtle malts appear first but are quickly quashed by the fruit flavors, then followed by the crisp hops. The hops provide a green apple like character. Quite sweet almost as though it were a hard cider. High carbonation in an otherwise light beer only adds to this impression. Is it a good beer?

The 5.5% is much lower than other Unibroue selections I've had. Definitely a unique brew, at least to me it is. A sweet apple taste dominates the flavor with some yeast in there worth noting.

Nice for a change, and well done, but the actual apple flavor didn't excite me particularly, so I give that an "above average". Actually, perhaps what I mean is, why do we need an apple beer?

It pours nice and big, but after a minute or so it falls into a thin lacing that doesn't hold so well. The color is a light cider brown, almost like a light IPA. The smell once you open it is apple. Floral apple tones that must be mixed with something citrisy...the bottle says coriander and curacao. They must be what I'm smelling in company with the apple. Now there's barley even a lacing. A minute head. The smell reminds me right away of a belgian triple mixed with hefeweizen. Clove is what reminds me of a hefeweizen. The mouthfeel is the first thing I notice, it's got that carbonation that's prominent and sticks to your tongue the whole time you drink it. The flavor is slightly clovey and Belgian-like, however the apple cider and light citrus then take over and finish dry. The flavor reminds me of a mixture of candy and medicine. Overall, I will probably not have this one again.","Erdinger2003","May 04, 2007"

I was able to notice the smell immediately after pulling off the cap. There is a good deal of sour green apple, granny smith like, on top with a bit of cloviness and banana underneath. The taste too starts out with a lot of sour apple flavor which is somewhat balanced by grainy, bready maltiness and a bit of hop spice it's fairly sweet as well. The apple flavor may dominate a bit too much for me. This beer is very bubbly and active on the tongue, finishes dry and leaves a lingering apple taste. Light and refreshing this beer is fairly drinkable if it is your "thing". I could see personal preference playing a huge role with this one, some will love it some will hate it, I find it to be an interesting, different beer from Unibroue, good but not great.","fank2788","May 02, 2007"

This would be a great refresher, would pair fantastic with a summer salad (Waldorf especially), lite seafood, or pork.

Sour apple aroma with a hint of banana. Very light taste of green apples but the carbonation predominates. Finishes in a slightly sour note. Light, tingly mouthfeel, dry overall presentation. Highly drinkable if this is your favored style. Light in alcohol and delicate in body that should appeal to white wine enthusiasts. Would pair well with stir fry or grilled chicken breast.","logansboat15","Apr 18, 2007"

Taste is slightly tart green apple with definite orange undertones. There is some biscuity maltiness there as well to keep it under control to some degree. Feels like a sparkling cider in the mouth. Carbonation is very high, which I like here. Fun change of pace for springtime, but not something I would want on a regular basis.","Duster72","Mar 25, 2007"

The smell is very strong and inviting, all apples with a hint of yeast. The taste is very similar. The apples are very powerful, but as you get to the bottom of the glass the yeast comes out revealing a belgian like beer. The mouthfeel is decent, light and crisp, but I would have like the carbonation to play a bigger role, maybe smaller due to the growler. This one is an easy drinker if you like fruit beer or belgians, the apples calm as you drink, and they do not drive the beer to be sweet or tart, but have a good balance. I suggest checking this one out. Cheers!","wingman14","Mar 23, 2007"

Some residual yeast notes here as well, as you'd expect from Unibroue. The body is quite light and refreshing. Heavy-handed carbonation, and finishes quite dry.

The snow-white head rushes up to fill the glass, and with a hard fizz like club soda, it disintigrates to nothing and leaves only a few scarce dots of lace. Wheat and pale malt in the nose, an a strong aroma of granny smith apples. Sweet wheat and extra pale malt flavors are met by a quasi-lambic tartness and a distinct apple taste that is not quite ester. The aftertaste is semi-dry with no hops to be found, and the overall flavor is left unbalanced. The sour flavor from the fruit and mild yeast bite are not enough to even out this overly sweet brew; reminds me of one of those foo-foo drinks. Very high carbonation and thin body like a spritzer. While the finish is a little on the sweet side, ultra-crisp-light mouthfeel make this fairly easy to drink.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 10, 2006"

Aroma is tart apples and some musty yeast/wheat - kind of like a sour Jolly Rancher. Taste is granny smith apples and grassy wheat. The apple is more subtle than in the New Glarus, more tart as well, but I just liked the Apple Ale better. Don't get me wrong, this is tasty, but I liked the sweeter cidery approach better than the tartness here. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp like the Ale. This fruit beer certainly has more of a "beer" flavor than the Apple Ale, but I preferred the later.

Big green apple aroma with some hints of lemon, bubblegum, and spices. Taste is a mild green apple upfront giving way to a clean wheaty malt and just the slightest tart aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth yet has a highly carbonated bubbly effervescence---very nice, although it does lead to some strongly appled flavored burps. This is a really good fruit beer, not at all like an apple cider that most people would expect, and is a really nicely flavored but accessible beer.","cubedbee","Sep 03, 2005"

It's a murky peachy color with ample carbonation and little head. The smell is of fresh rinds of Granny Smith apples, perhaps simply some citric acid. The strange smell is in the aftertaste, although the beer itself has a very thin body and a weak malt character. I'd like to see a strong pale given this dose of apple, but instead it's a weak glass of wheat beer.

Big white head crops up immediately, then dies down to about a finger. Aroma is very interesting and inviting. Huge fresh cut green apple character, also some pale malt with plenty of yeast. Somewhat vinous in aroma. Flavor starts off with lots of bready malt, not unlike a Belgian pale ale. Bitter green apples quickly come into the picture, adding an acidic bitter character to the semi-sweet malt. Hops are present with the faintest of citrous bittering, and a spicy flash. Yeast is noticeable, as well as the coriander. Finish is slightly vinous, but is a little too sweet for white wines. It is not too far removed from a hard cider. However, the apples are kept in check by the huge malts and it does not drift into the cider category. Kind of a cross between a witbier and a hard cider, yet influenced by Belgian pale ales. Very interesting indeed. Carbonation is crisp and powerful. A little sweet for my liking, but still complex and a good change of pace.","BeerFink","May 07, 2005"

Nose was full of tart apple. I figured this would make me pucker, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the apple flavor somewhat mellow. More like appleskin than tart apples. Mouthfeel though was thin and the beer/malt flavor was subdued. This is certainly a thirst quencher, but I wouldn't make it a regular beer.

Nose is light fruits and sweet perfume. This is a light fruity brew, pleasantly light on the palate. Notes of crisp tart apples, and some yeast.

The first thing you notice when opening the bottle is that fantastic apple smell. And the pour... what a lovely Belgian head. Mm-boy. The taste is superb, not too tart (which you kind of anticipate due to the Granny Smith aroma) and with a good "full" feeling in the mouth.

The slight sour taste compares to actually biting into an apple, tongue tingling and all. Not a beer to have after a large meal as it tends to tense the stomach after finishing the first glass.

Mild but solid apples with the spice and the malt to keep you noticing it's still a beer. Almost nothing like a beer though. No bitterness whatsoever, everything is just like the title, 'Ephemere'.

Label describes it as "lively" - was it ever: high foamy, almost fluffy, head. Very active carbonation in the glass, in fact it kept foaming even when glass was half empty. Due to the strong apple aroma, I was expecting a similar strong apple cider taste. The taste was a very light apple flavor (almost disappointing because it was all smell). A nice change, look forward to the next seasonal.","BigBry","Oct 24, 2004"

I believe that the aroma is exactly as it should be....ripe apples; and it surely is. I can honestly smell it from about 3 feet away. Its only weakness is that it smells a little too sugary. The taste is wheaty with an apple candy backbone. A tart finish seems to fit well with this beer and somehow the taste comes together.

Intense apple aroma can be smelled feet away after being opened and poured. Surprising because when you actually bring the glass to your nose to smell it, its not quite as powerful as you would think it would be. Very beautiful bouquet of apples, very sweet smelling. First sip is loaded with apples, strong carbonation in the beer expands and explodes in your mouth. Definite flavors of coriander. This beer must also contain a lot of wheat because it has a residual sweetness, yet it finishes fairly dry. The weird combination of apples and malt doesn't mix extremely well, but it leaves a very pleasing apple and wheat aftertaste.

Beautiful fragrant aroma of ale yeast, wheat, and lots of fresh, tart apple. Light, airy body, reminiscent of champagne (not particularly foamy, but airy like it's not even there). Apple and coriander dominate the palate, with a candy-like sweetness in the background. Great accompaniment for the pear almond tart I'm eating for dessert. That's what I'd call it, a dessert beer.

Strong green apple aroma, some malt and coriander, quite inviting. Carbonic acid was honestly the first impression after the first sip, highly carbonated. Subtle apple comes mid-palate and then faded to some residual traditional witbier spicings in the finish; dry, light and airy. This would pair up pretty good with some pastry-encrusted baked brie with honey drizzled on it. Not too aggressive, just about enough fruit and spices to appease the senses. My only gripe is it seems overcarbonated; I'll be burping apple Jolly Ranchers for an hour. Drinkability's good, one's enough, though, I could see a severe case of the "green apple quick-step" if drank in mass quantities.","crookedhalo","Sep 09, 2004"
3.65,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Slightly hazy from the suspended yeast particles, yellow-gold in hue with a very modest peachy influence. A massive bright white head topped the beer; it was at least three fingers in height. Impressive. The head retention was admirable; it slowly faded to a tight cap. The subsequent lacing was patchy but it didnt cling well. Still this is an interesting looking beer and my curiosity is aroused. The nose is airy, it reminds me of a Wit. Wheat aromas start the bouquet, followed by a kiss of marshmallows and dried oranges. There is a very faint suggestion of spice. These aspects are pleasant as is, however this says nothing of the lovely green apple aromas of the finish. The apples dont smell like cider but more like a Jolly Rancher. The potency isnt very strong, this is disappointing, regardless the bouquet is still inviting. In a word the palate could be summarized as refreshing. That said, the beer isnt outright flavorful, sure it is tasty but where is the flavor depth? Upfront is a mild sweet wheat and marshmallow taste, which softens by the middle. Here the green apples emerge and then fade. The finish is malty with a dash of spice, apples, and dried orange peel. Not to mention a kiss of yeasty dough. In the aftertaste the apples reappear. Overall the palate is pleasant but it is far from remarkable. Still Im not complaining drinking this. Medium in body with big, lively carbonation, the mouthfeel is very enjoyable. This is the best aspect of this beer. The effervesce cleans the tongue after every swallow. Refreshing. I bet this beer would kill with pancakes. Yum. The low abv is a plus too. It is an easy quaff. This would make a pleasant lazy warm Sunday afternoon beer. Even though the palate isnt very bold I still enjoy it. I would really like to try it again.

I was still skeptical at this point that it was just going to be overly sweet and too fruity, but I was wrong. First sip indicated that it was not sweet but in fact pretty dry and you could actually taste barley malt and not just apples. It was immensely interesting to have the the malt flavor compete with the green apple flavor to see who wins. It was a dead heat - both flavors are winners.

The smell is strong of green apple and behind that is the smell of their pale ale, blanch de chambley. The flavor is Tart, crisp, dry, green apple, and a little bitter at the end.

Nice balance of malty sweetness and hints of hoppy bitterness, make this not a cider but a wonderful beer with some complex character.

In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a hazy golden-straw color, and was topped by an active and voluminous white head that left thick blanketing lacing. The nose was zesty with musty, sharp, and juicy tart apple aromas. Notes of coriander and a lovely rich floral component added the right touch. The taste was mellower than expected, with an initial creamy smooth coriander component, which became more tart and apple-spicy in the transition to an anticlimatic and subdued finish. Only a mild lingering coriander essence remained after the tart flavors abruptly dropped off. I did enjoy the interplay between the smooth coriander and the tart apple. The body was comfortably smooth and full and the carbonation was nice and fluffy. I found this beer to be an easy drinker for the style.

The taste is citric and tart, hint of apples, hint of residual sweetness right before a dry finish. Rather complex, moreso than what I was expecting. I'm still missing flavors because they rush by at full tilt. Mouthfeel is very tart, hint of sourness, very bubbly and light all over the tongue. This is a tasty beer, but not one I'll be rushing out to buy again. Well, not for me, anyway, but the missus will probably demand it again shortly...","jlervine","May 12, 2004"

The color is a light amber and a medium white head forms on the pour. The yeast from the bottle makes it look like there are actually apple bits floating in the beer (cider). The taste is apple cider, through and through, with none of the off tastes found in most commercially available ciders. This one is extremely tasty, but it definitely tastes more like a cider than a beer. There aren't really many beery qualities at all, in fact. Still, I have a feeling this will find itself in my regular rotation, especially in the warmer months to come. It is very refreshing and extremely drinkable. My only real complaint is that the carbonation level is a wee bit too much. It almost burns your tongue there are so many bubbles assaulting it.","Hagbard","Mar 17, 2004"

Aroma is fascinating, with bubblegum and McIntosh apples, with an array of Belgian-like spices in the background(cloves and coriander). Mouthfeel is a dose of fizzy carbonation, akin to a Belgian pale ale. Taste is surprisingly complex, with a yeasty, mushroom earthiness, tart green apples, fresh baked bread, cloves and coriander. Flavor profile is very similar to a fine Belgian pale ale, with the addition of sour apple. Very nicely done.

It was actually difficult, had to drink a great deal before I could get to the yeast at the bottom to pour it in even though I'm sharing this with my girlfriend. These Blanche de Chambly glasses hold very little. Anyway, after all of that this becomes a very cloudy banana-colored brew with a large white head that stays pretty well. Aroma of apple Jolly Ranchers, yeasty banana taffy, and vanilla ice cream. Lots of sweetness. Have to give it points on that aroma, it's very unique. It surprises you when it hits your tongue, no non-malt sweetness at all and no invasive fruit character. There's a dose of green apple in there, but it's not overpowering and doesn't take away from the wheaty goodness of this interesting wit. Light-bodied with delicate yeast spiciness and lots of wheatiness with a touch of clove. Minimal hops, but they're there and balance it out well. It's like Blanche de Chambly with apples.

Candied, sugary, yet vibrant green apple along with bubblegum esters hit the nose simultaneously upfront in aroma. Softer, rounding wafts of orange peel and signature Unibroue juicy lychee like yeast esters surface as the nose adjust and the beer breathes. Understated waft of herbal phenolics. Reminescent of a green apple Jolly Ranchers dropped into a glass of Duvel. Unique, and oddly enticing aromawise. Apple flavors abound in the flavor profile, but are more of a tart, Granny Smith nature. Pronounced, static, bubblegum undertone, lends a lingering suggestion of flavored flouride treatment. Fruit flavors are sharp and extract like initially to the palate, but mellow as the brew breathes, eventually melding with the mild notes of clove and crushed coriander. Sucrose sweetness augments after a deliberation and couples with the persistent green apple theme, yielding a sweetened, sparkling apple cider impression late. Whimsically spritzy in mouthfeel, light in body, and nearly refreshing. Bitterness is mostly curacao derived, and the paltry hop presence leaves fruit and yeast character unhindered. Finishes surprisingly juiceless, with an abrupt note of tart apple marmalade. Quite an odd brew. Akin to a Belgian wit / cider hybrid. Although it grew on me as I drank it, I don't forsee myself getting another bottle anytime soon. Enjoyable, but certainly not a showstopper.

I could taste the apple, and some yeasty breadiness, but other than that the taste was so light and ephemeral (hence the name) that i kept wanting more richness. This is not to say that its a bad beer, and it would be brilliant to cook with or drink as an appertif in the summer.

The aroma of tart Granny Smith Apples hits your nose first, then the underlying malt sweetness with a citrus like crispness, a real treat for the senses. Start sweet and the top middling in its feel to the palate, the finish has a stinging acidity, very, very dry, tart with the hops present but understated in their spiciness, quite a treat as Fruit beers do not rank high on list of beers.

Lots of green apple with the skins even, not cidery tart, more like a subdued creamyness like an apple shampoo, has some banana, pear and musty notes. Not all that strongly pungent but wonderfully complex and subtle. Taste is sparkly smooth with an easy going apply bite of green apple, with the skins too, light pear and banana with a smooth yeasty finish and a fading soft crispness.

The color was a nice light golden color with a cloudy appearance. There was a nice head to it that did stick around for a little while. The taste was quite refreshing and while the apple was quite evident, it was overpowering. It had a light mouthfeel which made it very easy to enjoy. There was a nice yeasty after taste.

Pretty dry finish. Moreso than just about any beer I can remember. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy. A bit too light for my tastes, but this beer pulls it off well.

Incredibly bubbly, sort of reminds me of champaigne. Head is thick, white, and fluffy; very long lasting. Smell of green apples is incredily strong. Smell is tart, and somewhat candy-like. Underneath the apple, if you can dig that far, is a smell of grainy wheat. Flavor at first is heavily laden with Granny Smith apples. It also has a very grainy wheat flavor, more noticeable after a few sips. Aftertaste is only slightly fruity, and rather big on the wheat. Light bodied brew, with a very rough mouthfeel.

The head that was produced was an off white head that had a creamy consistency and lasted fairly well, but when it fell, it went fast. Some lace visible, but nothing outstanding. The aromas were mostly of green fresh picked granny smith apples, some spices were present (clove, cinnamon, coriander), wheat grains and other fruits could be smelled (banana, orange, lemon). The tastes were a mirror to the nose, mostly green apples, wheat grain, fruits (lemon, banana), spices (clove mostly with some coriander). It left an aftertaste of fresh apple pie with a wheat flour crust. It was light bodied. It started off a little on the over carbonated (sharp) side but calmed down fairly fast. It reminded me of champagne with apples in it. For a hot summer day this beer was very refreshing  it quenched my thirst and was pleasant to drink.","Jarod","Aug 16, 2003"

Poured a hazy golden orange with a whipped white head. This is one of the best smelling beers I've had. Unibroue yeast and wheat at the base with an ethereal sour apple aroma dancing around. I wanted my small glass to turn into a pitcher so I could chug it! Taste was refreshing wheat/yeast with a very subtle sweetness (the smell was deceivingly sweet, but I was glad to find the taste not so). Finish was crispl and slightly tart with powerful granny smith apple notes ( but not sweet like cider). The apple notes lingered. Best "summer beer" I've had this year.","alexgash","Aug 15, 2003"

I'm not too familiar with coriander and curacao, so I didn't know what to look for in the flavor for them.

The nose is faint with an apple sweetness. This is a very balanced beer with a definite apple theme that is not overdone. Sweet red delicious apples support the malts up front and almost lip puckering granny smith apples travel with the hops in the back end. There is a refreshing bite from the carbonation and the finish is dry. Overall this is a very unique beer that is extremely drinkable.

I am happy to discover that this beer is not very cidery or acidic. There's just a little tart senstion, but not a lot. I reminisce about the green apple taffy I enjoyed during my youth as I drink. The musty undertones really add a pleasant quality to this beer. Just a slight amount of bittering is noticed. Lively carbonation is noted in the mouthfeel. Body is a little better than medium.

Carbonation is strong. Aroma is intoxicating....fresh green sour apples perfectly in harmony with the trademark Unibroue yeast notes...cloves and a hint of banana to round it out. One can smell green apples across the room. Oh boy...what a taste. Amazing stuff this is...tastes exactly as it smells, however the green apples are not as strong as I would have thought by aroma, but still tart and juicy, complementing the crisp wheat and delicate pale malt body. Mouthfeel is spritzy like champagne with a brisk, clean mouthfeel and slightly astringent finish. Hops are only in the background and slightly perfumy and contribute just enough bitterness to complement the sweet apples. Very easy to drink, however I would have liked just a tad more malt sweetness. This is great stuff...indeed another masterpiece from Unibroue. I can only imagine what the peach tastes like.","Mitchster","Aug 07, 2003"
3.21,-10.8,2.5,4,3,3,3,"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: I honestly don't much see the point in a granny smith beer. Pours a murky yellow with a medium white head. Quick lacing. Strong aroma of sour apple and wheat. Light-bodied with a character consistent with other beers of the style. Sour apple dominates the flavor, along with some wheat and spice in the background. The finish is rather crisp and stays with the apple theme. Not bad for what it is, I just don't see the point in beers like this.","Dogbrick","Aug 06, 2003"

Apple is the perfect choice for the style, which i believe is something close to a witbier. The coriander is very spicy, and lends the perfect compliment to the sour apple flavoring. I'm not sure what curacao tastes like, but an odd sweetness seemed to mingle with the apple, so perhaps that was it. Malts are light, and allow the other flavors to take precedence. Body is very light, and the carbonation is perhaps a bit too high for my tastes. Almost like champagne, with vigorous small bubbles. I'm not really into that, but I can't say it didn't work for the beer. Great summertime quaff.","UnionMade","Aug 05, 2003"

Moderate in body with a spritzy and zesty texture from the strong carbonation. Taste is sweet candied sugar and tart green apples with a bit of fruity yeast.

The bubbles here are fine (like champagne), and the mouthfeel is superb, with very fine, again, Champagne like carbonation. The addition of orange and coriander is ever so faint and does wonders for this beers overall complexity. A cleansing bitterness prevails on the finish and baits you for another try.

Hard to get past the apple in the aroma, but there's also a sense of sharp goat cheese and a prickly spice. Compared to the smell, the flavor is quite muted and fluffy, coriander leavens apple and is joined by a pumpkin pie impression. A bit of ester. Light and well carbonated. Slight currant and citrus aftertaste. Not really my style, I actually like to hold my nose on this and somewhat limit the apple aroma's impact on the overall flavor profile.","ADR","Jul 19, 2003"

The taste has some apple tartness, with a bit of spice, probably from the coriander added. It has to be one of the most refreshing brews I've ever had.

Seltzery white tiny bubbled, the head settled down after a few moments and I was able to fill the glass. The aroma is perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this beer. Granny Smith apples, more to the candy-ish Jolly Rancher side of the spectrum, but as the beer warmed a sweet, cotton candy element emerged as well. The green apple notes were more subdued in the flavor, and could have been taken more for a yeast by-product than a brewing adjunct. The overall effect was a Belgian take on fruit beer. Not spectacular, but interesting.","Brent","Jul 16, 2003"

Taste is big on green apples up front, obviously, but lingering behind are orange rind, clove, and coriander. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, despite the carbonation that is obviously present. This is a light-bodied brew for the most part, although it can be filling. Overall, while this brew is not overly sweet nor sour, the apple flavor lingers after the final sip.

Sort of like a watered down Fin du Monde with apple added. The apple does contribute tannic length (thanks MJR!), and the mouth-feel is all bottle-conditioned soft fine carbonation. An interesting beer, but not one I'm sure I'd have again (although I'm still burping apple the next morning, so in a way . . .).","Realale","Jun 09, 2003"

4.4,22.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"750 ml bottle best before 5-1-05. Pours a hazy straw color in the glass. Head slowly builds to a mountain of white foam. Aroma is sweet floral scent with a bit of coriander. The first sip reveals a much drier beer than I had imagined. The apple juice doesn't add much sweetness. The taste is also far more subtle than you might think with a fruit beer. Very subdued appple flavor. The other thing that is quite noticeable about this beer is the mouthfeel. It is like soft water. Carbonation is not harsh and is silky on the tongue. I've got one for the cellar too.","mjohn27603","May 31, 2003"
4.47,24.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I really enjoyed this beer. It poured out to a chalky, cloudy, golden color in the glass. The aroma is excellent. Light apple and other fruit. The taste was quite good. The apple is done just right, not overbearing at all and combined with the spices made for a nice, summertime-style, treat. This beer actually reminded me of drinking champagne. Definetely worth a try. I'll be revisiting it before summer is over.","proc","May 27, 2003"
3.58,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Cloudy golden/orange pour with a huge head. Light fruity nose highlighted with apple, a hint of dried apricot and some spiciness. The taste to me was of less apple than the nose had suggested. In fact i would say it was somewhat light and creamy with a "bubblegum" finish. Not sweet at all but more subtle and refreshing. Not bad as an overall beer drinking experience.","Popsinc","May 24, 2003"
4.09,13.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"As usual, Unibroue has produced a solid, respectable beer. It's not their most complex or ground-breaking beer, but what is a run-of-the-mill beer for Unibroue could be considered a triumph for just about anyone else.","Garin","May 22, 2003"

4.12,14.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy yellow-gold body that's topped by a frothy bright-white head that displays excellent retention and maintains a firm 1/2" cap throughout. Unfortunately, it leaves only minor spotty lace. The bouquet expresses an amazing aroma of fresh-picked Granny Smith apples. It's lightly sweet and tart (and yet there's no tartness in the flavor?) - very enticing! It's light bodied and crisp with a zest on the tongue. The flavor delivers much less than the aroma might lead you to believe, but it's still quite nice. Soft apple notes combine with some yeasty fruitiness atop a thin, well-attenuated and lightly sweet malt. It's quite delicate, and somewhat one-sided, but nice. It's very reminiscent of a light white wine. And although it does have a great drinkability in that it's light bodied and refreshing, I was left looking for something more.","NeroFiddled","Feb 27, 2003"
4.23,17.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours out a slightly pale gold colour, big head (it is Unibroue, after all), and fine carbonation. Oh how I love these big bottle conditioned beers. Nose brings some light apple scents which instantly fill the room as soon as the cork is pulled. These are acompanied by a slightly bready, yeasty note. Flavour: well, the short description on the bottle says "beer on lees with apple must". That's absolutely perfect description of the taste. This is apple, but soft and light - unlike Niagara's unique all-out apple attack. Must is evident, with yeast, bread flavours. Think clean laundry as it comes out of the dryer (w/o Bounce or similar sheets) but in a good way. Mouthfeel is classic bottle conditioned, light, energetic, happy. Drinkable? Yes! This is good beer. Can't wait for the Ephemere mixer pack to make it to Ontario (I know it's coming...).","the42ndtourist","Jan 25, 2003"
