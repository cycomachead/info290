This is such a great beer that it really does bring a lot of memories and thoughts to mind. Outstanding! The cherry and apple elements shine through, with a complexity to the fruit blend and the lively carbonation. The body is full without being too slick or sickly.","Barnoloid","Saturday at 10:30 AM"

Syrupy for sure.  The apple might be adding to the cranberry finish, if we're dealing with crabapples or green apple flavors.  Its hard to tell.  It tastes like awesome cran-cherry fruit juice, and not a whole lot else.  I could see this as the best syrup in a great berlinerweisse.  On its own, this is a great dessert after a hefty pot roast or thanksgiving dinner.  It's not crazy complex, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better fruit beer.","UnionMade","Aug 21, 2014"

I'm a sucker for fresh squeezed juice and this is about as close as you can get to it from something pertaining to the beer world. How New Glarus manages to hide all the malt character of the beer is beyond me. But I'm glad they succeed as I'm not a fan of fruit beers that display a malt backbone.","MarcWP","Jun 08, 2014"

There is little carbonation and the texture is not thin. Overall this is very well done, loaded with fruit flavor and not super complex, just Really delicious.

Tons of apple cider with a lot of juicy red cherry and cranberry juice cocktail thrown in for good measure. A hint of ripe pear, fruit leather and red apple skin on the finish. Just enough carbonation to break up the sweetness, though it could maybe do with just a touch more. This is the most fruit I've ever tasted in a beer.

Aroma of cherry and sweet apple pie is out of this world and pretty closed to being perfect. Taste is also dominated by sweet apple pie notes with some sweet cherry notes and light malt presence. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Very easy to drink and almost veered into juice category but in a really good way.","Phyl21ca","Apr 28, 2014"

Tart and sweet cherries with bits of brown sugar and a touch of apple cider and tart berries with a hint of vanilla and oak. The flavor is quite sweet but the tart and fruitiness from the berries and apples counter that nicely. Very subtle woody vanilla flavors round this one out nicely. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet light syrupy mouthfeel. Nice brew, I would have really liked a bit more tartness, but I still had no problem enjoying this one.","johnnnniee","Jan 11, 2014"

The beer is a canvas with which to showcase the fruit and it does it almost perfectly. This is definitely worth seeking out. If it was available in my area, it would be the perfect beer to stock up on and drink during the summer.","Jonada","Jan 05, 2014"

Decent lacing and the head shows back up with each swirl. Aroma of dark sweet fruit (raspberry, cherry, tart apple). Aroma also has some slight funk to it, like earthy yeastiness. Taste is of cherries, raspberry, some plum, and blackberry as well. Very sweet. The tart cranberries are nice, but they don't cut the sweetness as much as I'd like. Good carbonation and medium body wrap the tongue in the fruit sweetness. Definitely another enjoyable brew from New Glarus.","mverity","Nov 29, 2013"

Cranberry and cherry hit you in waves. At the same time, there's never any mistake this is beer, not fruit juice, not a wine cooler. Fantastic stuff. Best fruit beer I've had.

The apple character is a blend of sweet and mildly tart apples, a blend of Gala and Pink Lady apples, I am tempted to imagine. The cherry character is a blend of dark red and near black cherries, a deep, fleshy flavor. Behind all of this is a mild malt sweetness, a blend of caramel and a little brown sugar. A touch of vanilla is also perceived. Medium in body and With a soft, creamy carbonation, this feels nice on the palate. Just a touch watery on the finish, the dominant lingering flavor is apple. Beautiful stuff, this is more cider than beer IMO. Very highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Nov 18, 2013"

Nose is very much reminiscent of Sucrets - medicinal cherry with the addition of ripe red apples. Taste is sweet and fruity - exactly what you would expect from New Glarus. The blend of fruits is really quite exceptional, but I don't get too much cranberry, although I suspect that its contribution was the medicinal notes in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, with a bright, lively carbonation. I am not a huge fruit beer fan, but New Glarus always hits it out of the park for me. This beer is so flavorful at 4.0%; however, it is not for the meek as it is really quite sweet.","Jwale73","Oct 07, 2013"

As advertised, sour cherry jumps to the forefront, backed up by notes of apple and cranberry. The taste is follows suit, with pleasant balance sour cherry sweetness and tartness, along with apple and cranberry. There's also a nice, fruity, spicy heat that follows in the aftertaste. The profile follows well, and is probably best compared to ginger ale for its sharpness. It thankfully has a low ABV (4.0%), or else I'd likely wind up face down on a sidewalk somewhere. For anyone who claims to hate beer, I'd recommend this in order to convert. Great stuff.","tbdkev","Jun 19, 2013"
4.09,-5.8,4.5,4.25,4,4,4,"Bottle from a friend. Pours a deep ruby red with off white two finger head. Huge bouquet of cranberry and cherry, sweet and tart smelling. Flavor is more cherry heavy with hints of the cranberry coming through. Very sweet, slight tart. More medicinal than I had hoped but not overwhelming. Lingering tart cranberry that grows on me while I go. Light to medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Cool beer, but not as good as Raspberry Tart.","BMMillsy","Jun 19, 2013"

Tastes very tart but the apples sure are noticeable. Cranberries are tart and there's ample dose of cherry at the end. Mouthfeel is medium with full carbonation and the finish is clean but with a lasting tartness. If this is oak aged, then the oak is present only in the tannins, but I am not sure. Overall it's a very good fruit beer but the label hints that it should be an American Wild Ale.","tewaris","May 22, 2013"

I noted highlights of different fruits as I tasted it - for certain there were cranberries and apples. While it was fruity, it had a nice malty background which is a reminder to me that it's a beer, not juice nor fruity wine. It's a 1 pint and 9 fluid oz. bottle, yet very drinkable and I did not share this (there wasn't anyone to share with anyway). A relaxing beer to enjoy both during the day (it's only 4% ABV) and in the evening hours. Enjoy!","Benish","May 19, 2013"

Smell is mainly a variety of sweet fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice fruity presence that makes it super drinkable.","UCLABrewN84","May 06, 2013"

Taste is cranberry well balanced with apples and cherries. The beer leans toward the tart side of things and helps the flavor profiles balance out like a well blended wine. There is a medium on lightly cloying body with moderate carb and a semi dry finish that makes me want the beer ice cold and in gulping portions on a early summer morning. Really a refreshing beer I believe to be an absolutely fantastic deviation from the normal New Glarus beers.","harrymel","Apr 27, 2013"

Explosive cherry aroma with some sharp tartness to it, immediately similar to Jolly Ranchers. Flavor is revelatory, as is the case with most NG fruit beers. An absolute barrage of concentrated fruit madness. Cherries make up the major flavor component, candy-sweet but natural-tasting, with a base of ice cider apple flesh and a perfect cranberry bite on the finish, rounding out the immense sweetness with a divine tartness. This is easily on par with Belgian Red et. al. and arguably better, due to the complexity and synergy thereof. Serendipity indeed.","illidurit","Mar 31, 2013"

The aroma smells strongly of green apple and cherry, with a hint of cinnamon. The flavor is pretty comparable to the nose, with the sourness taking center stage up front before a mild, honey-like sweetness comes through on the back end. The first sip really is delightfully puckering. I don't taste the cranberry so much per se; rather, it synergizes seamlessly with the other fruits. The cranberry actually seems to come through a bit more as the beer warms. A tingly, ascetic sourness asserts itself in the finish, kept vital by the perky carbonation. A distinct cinnamon flavor adds an extra element that keeps the melange from becoming too fruity. In spite of the bold flavor, the finish manages to remain mostly dry. This really is a fantastic sour ale that never becomes cloying in spite of its flavorful character. Another winning fruit beer from New Glarus.","MaximalC","Mar 29, 2013"

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a deep ruby red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, apple, raspberry, cherry, and cherry cough drops. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, apple, raspberry, cherry, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I am a really big fan of New Glarus’ other offerings and this one was no exception. Tons of sweetness without being too sweet. Tons of fruit without being too fruity. There is just so much going on in this one with a nice balance to top it off that it makes it incredibly easy to drink.

4.11,-5.3,4,4.25,4,4,4.25,"a lovely treat from new glarus. this one was made thanks to a cherry shortage, so cranberries and apples are added to account for the diminished cherry crop. the result is quite pleasant, and perfect for holiday season. the pour is raspberry looking pink in color, maybe a little darker, with a few fingers of fizzy white froth. the nose is remarkably sweet, like fruit candy, but also tart, a sour beer for sure. yeast is interestingly balanced out by the fruit, smells like sour granola. the taste is cranberry and sour yeast tartness at first, and then gently gives way to a holiday spice complex of apple and cinnamon and warming mulling spices, the spice then dies out and a ton of residual sugar is left over. this exacerbates as it warms. great feel with a ton of carbonation, made even lighter and more airy by the thin malt profile and the low abv. a lot like the raspberry tart in the sense that i dont need a whole 750ml bottle of this for myself, but it was a joy to try. i hope for plentiful cherry crops, but i also hope this beer stays in the lineup, a really nice compliment to some of their other fruit beers. the champaigne mouthfeel goes perfectly with the fruit and the sour. well done.","StonedTrippin","Jan 15, 2013"

The cranberries really show up on this finish as this tarts up quite nicely. This sets itself apart from the other fruity mainstays from these guys. It's sweet, no doubt, some would say too sweet. But the tartness comes through at the right moment, giving a nice kick to the back end. I think I'd be able to get through a bottle of this one my own, but I find it is the perfect beer to share. Sweet. Tart. Tasty. Thank you, Dan. You work quite the magic with some fruit.","Onenote81","Nov 20, 2012"
3.77,-13.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to Traci for sending this one out for me to try. The beer poured out as a vibrant red color with a fizzy white colored head on top. The head settles and doesn't leave any lacing or retention behind on the glass... The smell of the beer smell like pure fruit with a little bit of oak in there to give it more of a natural essence. The taste of the beer is like fruit punch, it's got the cherry and the apple and the cranberry all in there at different times. The flavors mix well but really give off a juice-like flavor. The oak is a little on the hidden side, I feel it could have been aged a bit longer to possibly give this one more of that wooden flavor. The mouthfeel of the beer was highly carbonated, it was sharp, tart and crisp. It's was also light bodied for having such a large amount of flavor. Overall I can't complain it's a good brew much like the Raspberry Tart and the Belgian Red from New Glarus. This one just adds a new outlook to what they're able to pull off when nature throws them a curve ball. This beer is enjoyable, it's sweet and juicy and loaded with fruity flavors. It's worth trying if that is what you're into.","Knapp85","Nov 18, 2012"

I think the reviewer who said this seems like a blend of Belgian Red, Cranbic, and Apple Ale is spot on...tastes like 70% Belgian Red, 20% Cranbic, and 10% Apple Ale. It has a light tartness to it which I loved, though it wasn't so sour that my girlfriend who doesn't like sours couldn't drink it; in fact, she loved it. World class, worth seeking out if you like their fruit beers.","mdfb79","Nov 09, 2012"

Big fruity aroma of cherries and cranberries, possibly apple too. The fruit is obviously natural with a light tartness to it. Flavors of cherry are most noticeable at first, then the supporting notes of the apple and cranberry blend in afterwards. Also in the mix is a nicely dry wood tannin in the aftertaste that balances the sweet tart quality of the fruit forward notes it leads off with. It's light body is reminiscent of Cranbic a little bit, so is the moderate tartness with a slight sharpness to it. Overall it's very drinkable, worth trying if you enjoy New Glarus' fruit beers, though it's not far off from the existing range.","emerge077","Nov 04, 2012"

Appearance is a deep purple red that is strikingly clear. It appears just like Juicy Juice. Minimal head and lacing. The nose is amazing. First thing that comes through is cranberry with a slight tartness. The apples then pick up and provide a bit of rustic character, and then comes the cherry. The three fruits are so harmonious which makes for a candied fruit aroma that suggests a bit of sweet and a bit of tart. The taste is incredible. It starts with the more candied side of the fruits, again with a nice harmony of the three featured fruits. The sweetness gives way to a nice tartness that takes over the palate. Delicious. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Overall, New Glarus has struck gold yet again with their fruited beer. This is perhaps the most balanced and delicious one yet. If you haven't sought this one out, do it...now.","homebrew311","Oct 30, 2012"

The beer pores a nut brown with red highlights and sports very little foam. The cherries pull through the aroma along with a heavy dose apples. The yeast also contributes. The flavor highlights the fruit: in many ways it reminds me of carbonated fruit juice with an emphasis on apples and a twist of beery goodness. The cherries nicely compliment the apples. The cranberries contribute tartness. The palate is left dry. This beer is complex with unique character.","BeardedBoffin","Oct 30, 2012"

I wish New Glarus beers like this one were available where I live (I had to trade for this one - thanks ABisonEgo).
