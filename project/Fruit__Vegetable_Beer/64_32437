The nose comprises blackberries, light blueberries, very light banana, mild biscuit, light sourdough, and a pinch of allspice. The taste brings in more of the same, the berries matched by some Belgian yeast-infused bread and a hint of orange peel and light grass. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty nice beer, one that I could see going well with plenty of foods (muffins and lamb dishes spring to mind).","TMoney2591","Jun 25, 2014"

So when I opened the bottle, I didn't think the smell was great, but they don't all smell great so that was whatever. The pour was good and the appearance was a good hardy beer. When it came to tasting I think it was just something that I didn't expect, so I didn't love it. Wasn't bad, but I'm not sure if I'll buy again soon. Mouthfeel was actually nice. Overall I gave it a 3 because it just wasn't for me.","douceman","Jun 23, 2014"

Did not live up to my expectations, but it wasn't bad either. If you're looking for a big fruit beer with natural flavors and some wine-like qualities this should be right up your alley.","glass_house","Jan 28, 2014"

This is aging really well, and I'm willing to bet I wouldn't like this beer freshly bottled nearly as much as I do now. I'm sure it would be a solid beer, but I can see it being super sweet, jammy and heavy on the fresh fruits used. This is becoming darker in color and richer in malts, sugars and fruits. Very, very tasty and complex.","Agent1","Jan 21, 2014"

Pours an interesting redish amber with a clingy thin white head. Smell is a lot of fermented funk, sour citrus, mild malt, and hints of blueberry. Taste is yeast, but opposite of the smell, i get mostly blackberry on the palate. Mildly sweet, a touch of sour. Leaves you with some fresh fruit on the aftertaste. Feel is great: easy, almost TOO easy to drink. You would swear this is more like 4 or 5%, certainly not 10. Nice boozey warmth once it gets down in the gullet. The alcohol can sneak up because it's so easy to drink. I downed a bomber inside of 30 minutes and definitely felt it shortly after. Good beer, preferred Red & White (if they can really be compared).","Samuel906","Beers"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012A. Pours moderately cloudy orange copper color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart raspberry, blueberry, grape, raisin, clove, light molasses, red wine, and earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with a good balance of yeast esters with the big authentic fruit notes; with a nice malt/spicy ester balance as well. Taste of tart raspberry, blueberry, grape, raisin, clove, light molasses, bread, red wine, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fair amount of fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, dark fruits, clove, light molasses, bread, red wine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruit flavors; with a good balance of malt/yeast spiciness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a slick and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Belgian fruit beer. Nice complexity of fruit flavors and balance of spicy yeast esters; and very smooth to sip on for a 10% brew. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 23, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, and berry aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

4.31,17.4,3.25,4,4.5,5,4.25,"Poured this Fruit Beer from a bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a blueish/purplish color, produced a thick white head, retention was average and lacing was minimal. The aroma of this ale consisted of malted barley and sour fruit juice. This is a full bodied beer, 10% ABV. - Thankfully, I had the St. Charles Whisker Biscuit to assist me with this. A sweet malted grainy cereal base that gives way to tart fruits (blueberry and black raspberry) - it is actually a nice balance between sweet and tart- The issue I have with many fruit beers is that they are all sweet from start to finish- This ale does a great job to balancing the sweetness from the malted grain with the tartness of the berries. Another note here is how easy to drink this is- This is a big beer but very easy to drink. Don't be ashamed to grab this fruit beer and share this with a friend.","GossageBrewery","Jan 15, 2013"

Dogfish Head makes some wonderful beers, they're one of my favorite brewers, but this is aggressive and obnoxious. The smell is nice -- mixed berries, I especially smell raspberry, but the taste is borderline unbearable. Tastes almost closer to a wine cooler than a beer it's so sweet and fruity.

Like many people on B.A., I'm not the biggest veggie/fruit beer fan and sometimes my reviews will reflect that bias (sidenote, dudes, please stop saying that fruit beers are "girly." I'm a woman and it makes me feel really unwelcome in the craft beer enthusiast community when gender is used as a benchmark for how good or bad beer is). This beer accomplished exactly what it is meant for. It's a good seasonal beer and you can tell they used real berries instead of fake flavoring. Would I rather have a robust porter or an IPA? Sure. But if I were looking for a fruit beer with some actual complexity, this is a really excellent one.","circus_cat","Beers"

2.98,-18.8,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"This beer pours an amber/ruby red with a white head that carries a hint of purple within it, and is very thick and frothing with happy bubbles, which dissipates slowly, leaving a nice half-finger head and also light and sliding lacing that droops in lovely cloud patterns down the glass. The beer smells sweet and yeasty, with nice hints of the malts and stronger hints of sweet berries. I also detect a slight hint of wet dog, which is a little upsetting to the beer… that may just be the sour berries doing funky things with the wet smell of the beer, but it is a little strange to smell. Malts seem sweet and light, and a hop character is not even there as the berry bite takes its place. The beer tastes very sour with a metallic/citrus tinge in the back of the taste which comes partially from the booziness of the beer, but that doesn’t entirely explain the metal. The beer is almost wine-like with light berry accentuations, which means this is definitely a sipper, not a chugger. My initial thought is that I should have had this in a wine glass and not in the pint mug I used. There is also some syrupy flavor after the taste has washed over your mouth, and the bitter of the raspberry definitely lingers in the mouth. It is very harsh on the tip of the tongue with carbonation. It leaves the mouth very dry and desert-like the farther it goes on the tongue, but the very middle and tip seems to be cloying with a thick and sticky syrup feel. It also leaves more of a wine’s sweet fruity lingering in the mouth than a beer’s crispness. Overall I am not very impressed with this beer, especially for its $13 price tag. It has a nice sour taste, but there are also some stranger things in the taste, especially the metallic/citrus anomaly. The fruit just doesn't do nicely with this beer. I either want more fruit flavor, or less and more beer; but where they stand is not really working for me. I also don’t get much of the blueberry in the taste, which is disappointing. I suppose the raspberry is just too strong of a flavor, but I would have loved to have sensed some of the blueberry. The beer is a meh, and definitely not a recommended from me. Honestly, I just want more berry flavor from this and it just doesn’t deliver.","Maxwell","Jul 05, 2012"

Smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries with a hint of tartness. Lovely aroma. Taste is initially just a bit tart, but quickly turns to alcohol flavor. There is some definite booziness to this (nowhere near Fort, but noticeable booziness). Belgian yeast flavors with some spice and dark malt. You still get some pleasant raspberry and blackberry...not really picking up the blueberry. Finish is warming and sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Although it drinks fairly light, the puree and booziness makes it feel much more heavy. Drinkability is fair. Overall, I was very skeptical going into this because I tried Fort not to long ago and hated it. This one could definitely use without the intense alcohol flavor, but it is an enjoyable beer.

Of course I am having it in from the 750mL bottle in a snifter. to be 10% it sure is hidden well, but most of that probably comes from age. if you like fruit beers this has to be a target of yours, it is a wonderful treat!","bravesandbeer","Sep 01, 2011"

Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium, with prickly carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Overall, a great "extreme" fruit beer, there's a ton of fruit in this high alcohol beer.","shand","Aug 28, 2011"

The smell of the beer is fruity, yeasty and has a little funk to it. The taste of the beer is a lot like wine in my opinion. I think the berries used in it give off an interesting flavor once fermented in this brew. The mouthfeel is semi-thick like most of the DfH big bottles are. Overall this beer is decent, I can't say that I've wanted or needed to have it since the first and only time I drank it. If I was at a party and someone had it I would totally drink it again.","Knapp85","Aug 20, 2011"

I certainly wouldn't stop here, I'd reconfigure the recipe and try to make something spectacular. I do harbor a slight concern that the base beer is the wrong platform off of which to build this recipe, but perhaps more fruit, and a bit more sweet malt action could save it.","AleWatcher","Aug 19, 2011"

4.1,11.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Dogfish Head Black & Blue is a clear, solid golden ale topped with a dense sand colored head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a super fruity aroma of fresh black raspberries and blueberries. It's a little sweet, a little floral and there's a whiff of light grain. It's medium bodied and lively. The finish is pretty clean and a little astringent. It's a little sweet and fairly bitter. There's a little sourness. It tastes more like fruit wine than fresh fruit. The black raspberry is pretty prominent at the start of the taste. It gets progressively more bitter as the finish approaches. It's mostly juniper and alcohol by the finish. Berries linger in the aftertaste. It has qualities of an old ale, a mead, a melomel and a sahti. It's very unique! It tastes a little boozy, so I wouldn't say this is for chugging, but it's enjoyable, unique and pretty classy.","yesyouam","Jul 04, 2011"

Scent is dominated by the promised notes of blueberry and blackberry, faint notes of alcohol follow with a moderate amount of grahmn cracker sweetness. Taste again is fruit forward, especially at serving temp. Blueberry is at the front with a light tartness, blackberry and faint hints of concentrated grape juice. Slightly cloying by time the 10oz is over. A grahmn crackery sweetness seems to intensify as the drink warms, a little spice comes out as well. Alcohol is quite noticeable. Medium bodied, carbonation is moderate, lightly dry. Overall i prefered this to the bottle, the fruit stood out more, even though the beer felt more one dimensional.","rfgetz","Jun 04, 2011"

Followed up by bright malty sweetness with some light sugars reminiscent of a Belgian tripel, and a somewhat bitter aftertaste.

The taste follows the nose exactly. A big blueberry and blackberry taste with a hint of malt to balance out the flavors. Sweet and smooth taste very good, very nice.

Full-bodied, dry, sour and borderline acidic, really gives your palate a nice twist. As in the nose the berry flavors knit into the whole and not clumsily obvious, not a "dumb" fruit beer. More herbaceous qualities here, match up nicely with the sour grapefruit and lemon component. Presents sufficient apple, apricot, pear fruit as well as honey and yeast to keep the sourness in check. Carbonation is light but contributes when it has to in order to continue forward progress.

3.48,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Was given a bottle of this last October as a gift. Decided to split 750 ml of this tonight with my better half. Pours a copper color with amber hues with very little head. Raspberries are very prominent in the nose with a hint of the blueberries. Taste is a tart punch in the mouth from the raspberries. As the beer goes on, the taste begins to mellow. It's somewhat refreshing in the Summer months. Good full mouthfeel - plenty of carbonation. Drinkabiliy is average due to the sweet fruit tastes coupled with the ABV.","jdubjacket","Jun 10, 2009"

Smell is definitely fruity with the raspberry seeming to be more assertive than the blueberry. Taste is berries with a moderate amount of sourness and some detectable alcohol, but I certainly wouldn't have guessed the abv to be as high as it is. Mouthfeel is also very light considering the style and abv; well carbonated being neither too assertive nor too light. Very drinkable, all things considered. I am pleased with it.","SilentSabre","May 22, 2009"

I expected something darker; I don't know why, since the label clearly stated a black-raspberry & blueberry fruit ale. Maybe it was the impressive dark bottle. Regardless, the pour was a pinkish-gold brown that settled as with lemon-raspberry fizz and minimal head or lace. A smooth-bodied but bright flavor of sour malt & berries with lemon. The 10% alcohol was non-existent; instead the sour lambic quality prevailed, not too sweet at all. I wished it were more complex, with a better lambic-quality or weisse aspects, as it was fairly simple, although quite nice accompanying my spinach & strawberry salad and bison-burger. I still think I would go for the Red & White next time...hmm...maybe a Red-White-Blue for Independence Day????","selecter70","Apr 28, 2009"

I didn't too much really.. The appearance is fairly nice with a cloudy, reddish-orange color that looks sort of like grapefruit juice. Aroma is mildly sweet but quite faint. Similar was same as I remember, a bit of berry-like sweetness but it seemed to have more of an acrid, acidic-like fruit sweetness to me, like cranberry or grapefruit more than blue or black berries. There is a bit of the blue in the aftertaste but you really need to look for it. The mouthfeel is very crisp with the carbonation and on the thinner side of moderate heaviness, so its easy to drink in that aspect, but theres a slightly unpleasant aftertaste right after swallowing. Overall, still a bit disappointing, but its definitely not bad and has to be appreciated for being organic, where many breweries might just add blueberry-flavored chemical sweetner to make it taste like blueberries.","BirdFlu","Apr 19, 2009"

Appears a color akin to the flesh of a ripe red plum with about two fingers of fluffy light ecru foam. A nice lace forms on the inside of my glass with each sip. Overall, a fantastic looking pour. Smells and tastes of sweet mixed berries, blackberry jam, blueberry bagels, a touch of spicy yeast, and a bit metallic in the taste. At over two years in the bottle, the alcohol is virtually non-existent. A notch above medium bodied with just about the perfect level of carbonation for my tastes.

The head was off-white and thin, the retention not very good and the lacing scattered. Odd looking brew... The aroma was semi-sweet, a combination of blueberries that gave it a musty quality, mandarins that gave it a tart note and some sourness and a bit of spices made more zesty by the hints of alcohol. For 11% this was rather subdued. The flavors again struck me as odd. Where were they going with this thing? It started with fruit puree, pulpy and rich before it went more tart in a gooseberry-like way along with a lot of alcohol and some sugars that tried to balance it out. Neither the blueberry or raspberry came through clearly for me and I kept feeling like the alcohol was rubbing other flavors out. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/full and the carbonation good. It was much more acidic that I would have guessed and though it mellowed out by the time I was finished with it I just wouldn't ever recommend it, especially for the price.","thekevlarkid","Jan 19, 2009"

The aroma is of, no kidding, berries and alcohol, but the combination seems to emit a tomato-like essence that reminds me of canned tomatoes like my mother use to put up. Very interesting, and a little off-putting. Intense flavors of rich, ripe fruit (mainly raspberries) push through the malts and sweeten the tongue in the center of the taste experience. One detects more malts and alcohol at the finish; hops are barely present, if at all. It's certainly not overly fizzy, and the body is medium. Overall, it's a nice brew, but the sweet, fruity flavors may make it difficult to pair with food. Actually, now that I've said that, this beer may be akin to a French-style rosé wine, so a nice pairing may not be out of the question. Bon appetite!","CWiggins","Jun 02, 2008"

There is a slight sweetness that is reminiscent of a tripel, but no flavors I'd identify as fruity, aside from a vague winey dryness at the end.

Mild bitterness with a lot of berry flavour up front, followed by earthy fruit skins and a slight tartness. A bit of malt provides some sweetness and there was a light alcohol flavour in the finish. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation. Slightly syrupy texture with a little warmth. Overall, the mouthfeel was a little dead.

I like that the fruit is fairly subtle, or at least not with the usual accompanying sweetness. The raspberries are up front, and as they fade out the blueberries step to the front. It's almost hard to think of this as a beer as it tastes and feels more like a wine. I do get a bit of malt flavor in the background, but just a very little bit.

The aroma is giving me definite blackberry fruityness that sits over a base that reminds me of wheaty beers, and is the same as I have found in the Red and White and Fort. The flavor is a little subdued to me. The fruityness is dominant, but it is also interrupted by a detectable alcohol character. It really seems to be somewhat distant in the flavor category. I'd like a more prevalent character. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, with a mild carbonation. I think the alcohol character works towards making the beer feel more thin.

It's only subtly tart, and it could stand a little tartness to balance the sugary side.

The alcohol is barely evident for its size, however all of th flavors seem to be fighting each other rather than blending well together. I like my fruit beers to either be slightly lighter in body, I found the bigger maltiness didn;t blend well with the berries, or to be more singularly focused on the fruit flavor, here things seem to be competing.

I can definitely pick up on the berry content now that it's warmed a bit, noticeably the blueberry (I love fresh blueberries, one of the reasons I had to try this beer). This beer certainly does have an alcoholic warmth to it. After a couple of sips, my stomach feels a touch warmed. The berry flavor is subtle, taking a back seat to a malty, grainy tasting beer. No descernable hop aroma or flavor to take note of, although there is a organic vegetal quality to the beer, but not hops. Carbonation seems a bit subtle due to the medium-to-thick body of the beer. Initially malty and sweet, with a faint tartness near the finish. I mentioned that I love blueberries and I'm just delighted that this beer kept its flavor in check.

I get no absolute traces of raspberry or blue berry, although I do get strong hints of berry, but what specifically I cannot discern. Malt is present with a weird dried corn note, plus very little hop aroma. As it warms the fruit becomes much more apparent almost sticky in my nostrils. Taste is slightly gummy or jammy alcohol is perceptible but by no means over powering. I taste hints of fruit in the beginning, a tinge of bitterness in the midsection and another flourish of berry character coupled with light malt on the finish. I didnt notice the normal alcohol warmth you would immediately after taking a sip of something 10 abv, but it did ketch up with my soon after. For me the mouth feel was a bit unexpected on this, I thought there would be much more residual sugar left over from the fruit after fermentation. I get the feeling the fruit had so much fermentable sugar in it that it left a smaller amount of desirable fruit flavor and aroma, but in tern helped to boost the ABV so high. Very interesting, definitely not a sessionable beer, not because of the drinkable factor simply because of the ABV.

Yuck, maybe they will be able to turn this around the next time they make it like they did with Fort.","Higravity","Sep 07, 2006"

1.58,-56.9,3,2.5,1,2,1,"Only available on tap at the Rehoboth Beach brewpub location, which is a good thing. This is a sour beer, and not in a good lambic way. Sour as in an off-tasting, bad-wine kind of way. Black & Blue seems to have a lot of characteristics of bad cheap wine, actually. It comes across as not being aged enough. Maybe if it was left to sit for a while it would mellow out, but as it stands now, this is an offensive-tasting, intrusive beer. The Black & Blue's cousin beer, "Red & White" was completely sold out in under a month, whereas B&B was still available, which should tell you something. Overpriced, too alcoholic, and difficult to finish. Avoid.","chOAKbarrell","Beers"
3.93,7.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Upon your first sniff of this beer it is pretty evident that it was brewed with a ton of fruit, about 300 lbs of fresh blackberries and blueberries to be exact. The taste is spicey, a bit tart and definitely led by blueberries and supported by the blackberries. You can also get a touch of the hops on the backend that round out this beer and a strong bit of carbonation running through. Although the fruit and spice blend well to form a pretty smooth, not too sweet beer, you definitely get the high abv burn on this one, more so than with the DFH Red & White. Although this beer is pretty extreme from the amount of fruit added and the high abv, it is suprisingly drinkable and smooth and worth a try if you can get it before it runs out.","ggaughan","0"
