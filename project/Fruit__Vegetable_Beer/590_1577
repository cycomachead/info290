Not at all reminiscent of flavoring. It's the real deal. Flavor is as good as you could expect from a cherry beer. Tartness wins in the end, but there's a great sweetness.","barczar","Aug 08, 2014"

A malt sweetness is lurking in the background, but it's hard to detect anything behind the huge cherry presence. The taste is only cherry juice. I'm not sure this can be called beer. I could drink this in the morning with my toast. Like with the other New Glarus beers of this ilk, I'm finding the 4 or so ounces I consumed to be a good amount. The sweetness and one noted-ness was just getting to me by the end. Still an absolute killer offering.","Davepoolesque","Jul 21, 2014"

On the palate, more cherries. Finishes slightly tart. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, possibly the finest example of a fruit beer I've yet had!","JohnG190","Jun 18, 2014"

The flavor is big on the tart, delicious cherries. Doughy malts back the full on sweet cherries leaving you feeling like you just ingested the best cherry tart in liquid form. This is exceptional fruit beer. Medium bodied brew with soft to dry cherries. Overall, an American classic, made with care in small batches as long as the local cherry crops allow. Almost impossible to find outside of Wisconsin and surrounding areas.","Stinkypuss","Jun 07, 2014"

There's an absolute ton of cherry sweetness in here, but luckily the carbonation is on point and keeps this from getting syrupy. A definite must try if you like fruit beers.

Like the best krieks, starts with straw and malt, followed by real tart/sweet cherry taste to burst in quickly and smoothly. This continues blissfully through the finish. Surprising taste for 4%, and somehow delivers the fruit without cloying. Highly recommended.","jbaker67","Jul 04, 2013"

Flavor is straight up jolly rancher cherry. Then more cherry. Bit of sour and mostly sweet. Light mouthfeel with medium heavy carbonation. So obvious these are actual fruit and not some flavored syrup. Over the top cherry and very good fruit beer. Still not as amazing as Raspberry Tart.","BMMillsy","Jun 20, 2013"

Just tart cherries. This was an extremely easy drinking beer. The ABV% won't sneak up on you. It was hard for me to put this beer down. I wish I could find a steady supply of this beer.

This brew is perfect for sharing with those who love wine to test their beer-boundaries and bring them over from the dark side with beer force. Besides the quality and enjoyment of this high gravity fruity wonder is the overall look of elegance and class with this beer's offering of a champagne style container with dripping red wax covering the neck of the bottle and capped top.

That said, I would like another small taste to give it a fairer shake. Pours a brownish red color. Fairly cloudy. Small beige-pink head. This beer was quite sweet and tasted like concentrated cherry pie filling. Good cherry pie filling, though, and no artificial fruit flavor. That said, there’s a strong cough syrup flavor in there, too. The feel is less sticky than the taste would suggest, but it was still a bit much, at least coming to the beer without any foreknowledge. Little to no oak was evident. This is a beer that I might enjoy a lot more in specific circumstances, like as a compliment to a fancy dessert, but I can’t say that I loved it on its own. It definitely gets an entry in my list of beers to revisit.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

4.42,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown with a thin pinkish head. Smell is awesomely cherry, like a cherry pie with a great mix of both sweet and tart notes. Taste follows the nose and is really quite excellent. The cherry pie flavor is incredibly well done, and it's got a bit of tartness happening here too. The beer manages to be sweet without being overly so, and actually is rather well-balanced and drinkable, which is what separates this from most other fruit beers. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best fruit beer out there, at least that I've ever had. It's incredibly well made and is much more complex than you'd expect from a cherry beer. The only thing that keeps this beer from getting a higher score is that it's not something I'd want to drink with any sort of regularity. This makes for an excellent dessert pairing beer, but I have a hard time seeing myself just sitting around and drinking a glass while watching a football game.","starrdogg","Nov 22, 2012"

Aroma is cherry Sucrets, cough medicine, thankfully moving to maraschino cherries and clafoutis/cherry pie. Taste is sweet, black cherries, cherry pie, rich and viscous with a major spiced note of cinnamon and nutmeg. Palate is rich, creamy, dessert like, not oily or watery. It’s not the show stopper that NG Raspberry Tart and NG Apple Ale are, but it is evident that if you like true cherry beer and aren’t in the mood for kriek, this is the ultimate non-sour cherry fruit beer. Just impossible for anyone to compete with New Glarus in the fruit beer category.","tarheels86","Nov 13, 2012"

4.47,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one of my favorites and could easily be considered a gateway craft beer for some. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the red was a murky maroon color with a very modest off-white head. From the top of the glass, one can detect a waxy cherry aroma that alomst brings to mind penny candies. I wonder if the wax top of the bottle affects the aroma. The initial taste brings a tall shot of tart and sour cherry, the best qualities of a cherry. The taste really grabs the attention of the sides of the tongue, making them tingle with delight. A backbone of a biscuity bread allows the cherry to shine, while still having a subtle quality. This Beligan certainly has some thickness to it, almost like a beer milkshake. Mildly fizzy, the carbonation and the thickness allow the taste to linger for several pleasant minutes. A sour cherry aftertaste continues the fun, not straying much from the initial taste. However, I find the aftertaste slightly more sour.","JohnnyHopps","Oct 30, 2012"

3.95,-9.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a a rusty brown/ maroon with tan-red head that fades quickly without lacing. The nose is very bright with notes of cherries, plumb, cane sugar, and slush puppie. The taste is similar to the aroma--a huge cherry sweetness that sugar-coats the palate followed by a very slight tartness to keep things interesting. Honestly this beer tastes and feels like a cherry soda...not nearly as attenuated as I'd hoped. However, it's been such a long time since I've had a beer like this that it's still enjoyable... I don't foresee myself getting this beer again, but it's still a great beer to suck down on a hot summer evening!","ThePorterSorter","Sep 02, 2012"

4.47,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wisconsin Belgian Red pours a very nice polished ruby red, with gorgeous cherry highlights. A little more than two fingers of bone colored foam crown the beer, with minimal head head retention and lacing left behind. The nose has a huge ripe, sweet cherry skin aroma, with just a bit of earthiness behind it. The flavor is an absolute cherry bomb. It's still predominantly sweet, but there is a bit of a tart cherry edge to things as well. There's a slight malty sweetness present at the open, and the earthiness comes through in the finish. The body is on the light side, though with a little more heft than I might have expected for a 4% beer. The carbontion, while on the bubbly side, does let the sweetness mellow for a second or two before really kicking in. Wisconsin Red is, outside of one or two sours, the best fruit beer I've ever had. Fantastic all the way around.","axeman9182","Jul 30, 2012"

Aroma of cherries--naturally--and distant biscuity malts. Tasted pretty much spot on like cherry pie, black cherries, and doughy malts, good balance of tart and sweet, with the sweetness taking a slight edge and the breadiness of the malt keeping everything under control. Medium body, slightly chewy, moderate carbonation, very good overall.","Rifugium","Apr 05, 2012"

Straight up cherry pie, crust and all, sweet cherry hard candy, with a soda spritzer level of carbonation. At the riverside brewery, this used to be aged in large oak foeders, not sure if that's still the case as it doesn't have much oak character at all. Mainly an apertif with cheese, or paired with a dense chocolate dessert. Not something to put down solo really, more of a crossover for wine cooler drinkers.","emerge077","Mar 12, 2012"

We also received a bottle of Raspberry Tart from the generous trader mentioned above, but Belgian Red edged Tart out by a hair. Highly recommended--especially for anyone who "doesn't like beer". To adapt a cheesy line from a commercial, "my wife doesn't usually drink beer, but when she does, she drinks Belgian Red"! (sorry, couldn't resist...)","mdvatab","Dec 04, 2011"

4.43,1.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"I received this as a gift from a Wisconsin friend. The pour was beautiful, a slight head that dissipated into a thin foam of carbonation. The color was a beautiful auburn red. Gorgeous for a beer. With a fresh, not too harsh, smell of tart cherries, the beer had an inviting aroma. With the first sip it was absolutely, completely, CHERRY! There is very little hint of malt, or even hints of beer characteristics. The smooth taste of the beer itself is full of fruit. With heavy notes of cherry, dashed with punches of tart this beer is refreshing, to say the least. The hint of tart and sour lingers in the back of your mouth. Within a few sips you can almost wish there was a crust to finish your cherry pie. Great use of fruit in a beer. Definitely a beer for those that appreciate a sour beer.","thedeezy","Dec 01, 2011"

This pours a cloudy, cherry red color without any semblance of a head whatsoever. The beer is plenty carbonated, but you wouldn't know it from the way it pours. The nose is loaded with cherries...in a Loudon's cough drop kind of way, minus the medicinal aspect. I know that's odd to say, but it smells really good. The nose leave's NO doubt this is a cherry based beer. The taste reminds me of the gelatinous part of a cherry pie. Seriously loaded tart cherry flavor profile. Absolutely fabulous. The mouthfeel is tart, with that lingering cherry pie aftertaste. This is just unique all around. This would be a perfect summer beer. It's light, very enjoyable, and would also complement a good meal or even dessert.","Retail1LO","Nov 29, 2011"

It does taste "good" but is just so straight forward and doesn't offer a whole lot of complexity. It drinks pretty light in body but due to the sugar, is pretty sticky.

4.8,9.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Having had this beer after New Glarus's Cran-Bic, I feel like this is just the inversion of sweet/sour I wanted. For me, Cran-bic was maybe .75 sweet to .25 sour. Switch those two values around, and exchange the cranberry for cherry, and you get this stellar Wisconsin Belgian Red. After having loads of Belgian Kriek's, this is an awesome response from Wisconsin.","petacutlasaurus","Aug 11, 2011"

I think both are great beers, but after having them side by side tonight I think this one is a bit more of a revelation. I think I've seen other beers go similar places to Raspberry Tart in the use of raspberries (perhaps just not as well); however, this is a first for cherries. I didn't know they could be so light and candy-like. I was really impressed how this stayed away from syrupy qualities; which is where I see this being divergent from Raspberry Tart. I wouldn't say grenadine flavors aren't in here, but most certainly the mouthfeel avoids stereotypical coating syrups. It's juicy, it's concentrated, but it's not syrup. I don't even like cherries that much to eat as a form of food, but I'll be damned if I don't drink them again sometime.","Cavery","Jul 30, 2011"

Nose was like standing in a cherry orchard in the summer and taking a deep breath. I was transported back to the days of my late grandmother's lattice-top cherry pies or making preserves in the early fall. I had some cherry preserves from Traverse City, MI while I was stationed on Diego Garcia that were intense, but this beer ... Holy Cherry, Batman! This left no room for survivors.

Taste is also dominated by cherries, with maltiness still lurking in the background. Mouthfeel is quite nice and tight with decent carbonation.

I could guzzle this stuff by the gallon and never tire of it, can't think of a negative except maybe there are more complex beers out there.

The flavor reminds me of organic cherry fruit roll ups. Concentrated tartness intermingled with cherry sweetness. Tasty, tasty stuff. For some reason, I also pick up just a hint of chocolate. Maybe some chocolate malts are added. This beer is utterly fantastic. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy for me but really, that's a little thing.

Now in describing the taste, there is basically a red fruit salad before me. Cherries, Raspberries, and hints of Strawberry to boot. The best part about the flavor of this beer in my opinion is that I actually can taste some beer maltiness behind it. That's really a pleasant surprise for me as far as the flavors are concerned.

Taste is a refreshing, sweet-tart, complex sour, acetic, cherry flavor. Not for amateurs! My friend and girlfriend didn't really care for it and they gave me theirs.

The smell was wonderful. When you are making a cherry beer you should smell Cherrys and nothing but. That is exactly what i smelled. The taste hit me as medicinal. I dont like to ever speak bad of beers but i could not shake the fact that it tasted like cough medicine. The mouthfeel was an exception to the taste. The beer seemed to be perfectly carbonated and didnt give me any reason to review it as bad. The drinkability of this beer was not good FOR ME. I emphasize for me because I know that there are people that could drink this like crazy but i am more of a beer guy and never drink wine.

It tastes pretty amazing too, with big sweet and tart cherry flavors, followed by a spicy wheat/malt backbone with some cinnamon spice. It tastes almost exactly like cherry pie. A fantastic cherry beer here, medium mouthfeel, creamy carbonation.

Mild tartness is present and the acidity and funk are very restrained (almost non-existent) for a beer that's supposed to have wild yeast and bacteria. The finish is a touch disappointing, with the sweetness fizzling out rather rapidly. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is a treat, but my 8oz were sufficient.

4.39,0.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a very hazy red color - and I mean red, not amber, but like ripe cherries or pomegranates. The head is thin and fizzy, with loose bubbles - white colored, kind of fades fast and only leaves tiny bits of lacing. Looks pretty normal for a fruit beer, but not extremely exiting. The smell is just full of ripe cherries. There a not unsurprising tartness, probably both from the fruit and the yeast, but the fruit is incredibly dominant, which is what is supposed to happen here. The smell isn't like candied cherries, or like cough syrup (well, maybe only a little bit), but the cherries smell amazing. When you taste it, you can kind of sense the beer in this - slightly bready, with a little bit of pale grainy sweetness. But still the cherries are allowed to shine, and enhanced by the yeast profile. The cherries come out first, like the tart orange/yellow cherries - rainier cherries I think, then it becomes like a darker, deep red, fully ripe sweet cherry - like bing cherries, then it takes on an aspect of black cherry cola with a rush of carbonation, and finishes with a yeasty tartness, still mingled with some cherry sweetness. Really a nice fruit profile on this. The body on this is nice and light and crisp, but the fruit actually makes it feel a little more full, but the crisp bite of carbonation keeps it in check. A very enjoyable beer. The depth of fruit is very interesting, a bit slowing, but not cloying. And at barely over 5%, you could stick with this for quite a bit.","taylorhamrick","Sep 14, 2009"

This is another great fruit beer by NG, but I'm afraid it suffered a little bit being tasted along side raspberry tart, which is hands down the most amazing fruit beer that I have ever had. Maybe it's just my preference for raspberries though, because the beers were almost the same except for the fruit flavor. Red color with a small head. The aroma is just a surge of cherry pie, almost leaning toward maraschino cherries in a fake way, but managing to tip-toe the line and come across a little more like pie-filling. The flavor is pure cherry pie with a light tartness and surprising and welcomed lack of sweetness in the finish.

But, it's easily one of the better fruit beers I've encountered. It's not very beer like, but has a strong enough flavor to be an overall success. From me, that's big for a fruit beer. Trust this.

I get a mild alcohol flavor more akin to wine then beer but it's faint. The flavor comes on sweet and tart and finishes so smooth it's scary. The carbonation dances with every gulp.

Taste: cherries, delicious cherries. The perfect balance of tart, sour, and sweet. Whatever beer flavor is in here is very subtle; think of Wisconsin Belgian Red as more of a fruit wine than a lambic. So while the beer-lover in me might wonder what the hype is about, my tastebuds will not deny how fantastically delicious this is. High sugar content makes for a slightly syrupy mouthfeel, though high carbonation keeps it from being unpleasant.

Taste is intensely rich, sweet and tart cherries. I love it. It's like liquid cherry pie. Medium bodied, high carbonation, feels a little sticky sweet.

Pours clear cherry red with thin head that almost immediately dissipated to a thin film. Obvious sweet cherry aroma with a little sour yeast. Taste follows smell - almost like an alcoholic cherry soda but with a somewhat pleasant lingering aftertaste of candied cherries. Not at all complex. I feel like this beer could use a little more balance, maybe a little more in the hops department. I couldn't taste any as it is. Medium bodied, light carbonation, sticky syrup. Overall, this is interesting and worth a try, but I would recommend splitting the bottle between four people.

The aroma of this brew is amazing with strong cherry and a sweetness that dances in your nostrils. The taste is bold as the carbonation tickles your throat and the bold cherry flavor explodes with every sip. The tart aftertaste is a great balance of the sweet cherry taste.

Smell is of fresh cherries and other fresh red fruits, jolly rancher, some vinous properties, hints of oak and wine. Flavor is composed of luscious cherries, pie crust, more oak, bits of tart funk here and there, but overall more sweet. Body is light, with wonderful carbonation that prickles the tongue ever so slightly. It is hard to believe that this is made up of malt and hops, as the fruit is so damn prevalent. Drinking this is far too easy, I could probably go through two bottles. This is close to being a perfect beer for me.

Nice red color with lots of carbonation. Smells and tastes, as everyone has already noted, like tons of fresh cherries. Amazing that New Glarus was able to pull off a fruit beer that has tons of fruit flavor without hampering drinkability.

Okay, great, let's get to it. Murky ruby-hue capped by a flamingo-pink head appearance and harbors an aroma reeking of unabashed cherrynicity, there's nothing fake or artificial about this beer. With a taste reminiscent of fruit leather, the flavor is certainly aggressive in it's sheer determination to cram that pound of cherries down your damn throat. It deftly walks the fine line between sweet and tart and carries with it a jolt of juicy, cheek-pinching acidity. The malted wheat and hops definitely take a backseat to the deep, strong cherry fruitiness. God, I hope you like cherries. The high level of carbonation in the beer does well to bring a much-needed levity to what otherwise would be a heavy body. You do like cherries, right?

4.7,7.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for including this beer in a very generous trade and giving me the chance to have this again and finally review it. This beer is even better than I remember it- extremely rich and spicy with laser-like cherry flavors. Almost tastes like a slightly less spicy version of a Gluhkriek there is so much spicy goodness in the beer. Pours a hazy red leaning toward brown a bit. Smells of sour cherries, cream, spicebox notes, and a slight cheesy funk, probably from the aged hops. The taste is downright magnificent. Glorious sweet and sour cherries with an almost vinous finish, a touch more of that cheesy funk, and lots of spice- clove, allspice, pepper, cinnamon. Complex, deeply flavored and long, and with a nice creamy mouthfeel that ends in a spicy snap. More proof that complex Belgian style brews can be masterfully done in the U.S. A wonderful beer.","Georgiabeer","Sep 11, 2008"

4.83,10.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The appearance of the beer is simply gorgeous. A shade of brownish red, perhaps a mahogany red. Whatever color you would call it, it is beautiful and not far short of perfect. Wonderful smell, with cherries and oakiness, a touch of hoppiness and malt coming through in harmony. The taste is even better. Cherries dancing on the tongue with the smooth oakiness balancing perfectly. A touch of sourness adds some contrast as well with the traditional beer-like tastes of hoppiness and malt delicately coming through towards the end. A long and smooth finish that is about as delicious and drinkable as beer gets. Exquisite.","Duffman","Sep 01, 2008"

After a bit of warming, the caramel and spice pull out for a better balance. I kinda wish I hadn't chilled it at all. Medium body & carbonation make for a smooth drink.

Flowery hops dance around the malt and cherries. Very complex nose. Right out of the gate in the taste is fresh Door-county cherry pie! What follows is an interesting mix of malt and rose-like hop flavors. Hop bitterness, however, is fairly restrained and it could be ramped up a bit to balance the moderate sweetness. I'm shocked this is only 5%ABV because the mouthfeel is like a Belgian Strong Ale. A very complex beer that you could spend all night finding new things to discover within.

High carbonation works to cut through the sweeness.. I am getting quite a bit of dough and vanilla.. touches of cinnamon. I could drink this for days before getting tired.. but I do see an end of the tunnel. 1/2 a bottle was fine for tonight.. just enough to make me want another.. but I will really need to be in the mood.

Very unique, and still pretty funky. The taste is a medium tart cherry juice. A little odd creaminess somewhere upfront, but very quickly fades.

Good sour cherry flavor with a bit of carbonation which seems to make the flavor pop. Ends on a pretty sweet note. The body is a bit heavy for the flavor but it's pretty light overall.

Smell is strong on cherry, and a cider type smell fills the nostrils. Taste is ridiculously sweet, with some sour tart notes finishing. Mouthfeeling is filled with carbonation making this seem like a cherry Italian soda /cherry cough syrup/cherry wine cooler.

Beer was capped off by a half inch of thin, tannish white head. Head faded almost immediately, and left virtually no lace behind. Smell was made up of mostly tart cherries. Black cherries, red cherries, dried cherries, they are all present in the nose. The taste was very one sided as well, but in a good way. All strong tart cherries. Definitely cherry pie in a bottle. Excellent tasting beer in my opinion. Had a nice thick, full, syrupy, tongue coating mouthfeel. Carbonation was right on as well. Awesome drinkability. Glad I have another bottle on hand.

Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet cherries blended with other tart fruit, sweet spice, and wheat. Medium-bodied with a complex fruit character of fresh cherries and strawberries along with spices and malts. Light wheat and yeast undertones at times.

The major scents here are cherry and cinnamon. There is also oak and sugar with a deep spice character. The taste is much the same, cherry and oak, sherry, hops, sugary-malt, fruit juice...tangy with bits of citrus. Highly carbonated, but incredibly smooth and balanced, slightly syrupy...dry finish.

The aromas of straight up cherries hit the nose right from the start. The phenols from the yeast and fruit are blended in there but make it rather nice. The taste of cherries is really strong and sweet, but balanced out by a slight bitterness. There really isn't any malt to speak of, since there are a pound of cherries in each bottle.

The aroma is a hedonistic cherry immersion, and the flavor is more of the same -- tart, fresh, delicious. Malt and hops are undetectable, as is the alcohol.

Smell is of what else, fresh cherries. The bottle claims they use over a pound of cherries in each bottle and I don't doubt that for a second. No alcohol on the nose at all, scary good odor. A bit of acidity seems to tickle the senses too. Taste is once again of what else, cherries. Starts off sweet and smooth and ends up tart and sour. I also detect a bit of bready malt in the flavor which helps balance some of the acidity. I think this beer tastes better than any juice I've ever had. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with a generous amount of carbonation bite. Drinkability is pretty good and goes down fairly easy but the acidity got to me a bit. If I could fill a pool with this beer and swim around in it, I would be the happiest man alive...I would be like Scrooge McDuck in Ducktales swimming in his coins.

Overall, I think this has much more in common with soda (or sweet champagne) than it does beer and that's probably why it gets such great reviews. Everyone loves pop. I'm not a big fan, so I don't think this floats my boat as much as the next geek. However, it does have an amazing affinity for food and, approached from that standpoint, I find it to be quite useful and amazing.

Both sweet and tart with a nice cherry fruit taste. Be sure to lick your lips after taking a drink of this one, because the taste you'll find there is delicious!

The nose is cherry, sour, more cherry, a little bit of cherry, some sour cherry, some ripe cherry, some fruit punch, some super concentrated cherry. You get the idea. The taste was better balanced, but still hit you over the head fruity cherry. This is more like sucking on cherry pits with just a little cherry meat left.

Very sweet aroma of cherries, cherries, and more cherries, with maybe some confectioner's sugar mixed in. Palate is again thoroughly dominated by sweet cherries - this almost comes across like a soda rather than a beer. A mild hoppy bitterness emerges on the finish, but there is still plenty of residual sweetness. Body is smooth and creamy, which does provide a little bit of an indication that this isn't in fact soda.

The color is a cloudy ruby color (wife called it blood plasma). It had a small head and tons of initial carbonation that quickly dissipated. The aroma was heavy on cherries obviously and also had a noticeable wine smell. The mouthfeel was mild and went down smooth with just the right carbonation on the tongue. The taste was amazing. It had the expected cherry taste but was perfectly balanced to not be overpowering. Granted I wouldn't want to have more than one and not all the time but having this every couple months would be perfect. Highly recommend unless you don't like cherry.

Huge sweet cherry aroma with additional notes of vanilla, and some pale barley malt. Very large in the mouth with the cherries obviously taking centre stage, along with a bit of other red berry fruit. As sweet as it is, there are more dimensions than sweet fruit to this beer, with notes of vanilla and earth. Its smooth on the palate, yet theres enough earthy bitterness to keep things in check. Not something you could knock back a lot of, but this is one heck of a dessert beer.","fisherman34","Dec 30, 2006"

Huge cherries, with a really sour finish, but yet sweet at the same time. the sweetness seems to be like a honey flavour. Good mouthfeel and carbonation. I'm not a huge cherry, so the flavour of this beer is probably wasted on me. I due to have to give credit for an awesome effort and a very complex brew.

4.72,7.8,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Many thanks to Faro for sending me this bottle in our trade earlier this fall. Murky scarlet, almost like watered-down blood with a thin dusky-pink foam cap. The aroma is almost an exact sensory replica of the scent one detects when opening a can of naturally sweetened (i.e. without high fructose corn syrup or any other goo) organic cherries; pure fruit, thick, pulpy, skins-and-all. There's a hint of tartness, too, so it's not all just a sickly-sweet mess of fruit. The flavor is more of what the aroma foretells: thick, chewy cherry pulp, intensely sweet but not syrupy with a tart, dry edge at the finish. There is little in the way of grain flavor; perhaps only a little funky tartness from the wheat malt. A small and indistinct spice note weaves in and out of the middle as well, sort of like faint cinnamon. Dry and tart on the palate; not too puckery, but the intense sweetness is all fruit and no residual sugar syrupy crap. I don't know that a cherry-flavored beer that isn't a lambic could be done any better than this. Very nicely done fruit beer, and very special beer generally speaking. This paired quite well with the vegan chocolate mousse I had for dessert tonight. My wife didn't like it too well, but she's a hophead.","orfeu","Nov 23, 2006"

Perfect blend of beer and fruit, and by far the best fruit beer I've ever tried.","nouseforotacon","Nov 19, 2006"

Maybe with a little belgian beer to thin it down to a drinkable level. All the flavors are worthy of a 5 rating. I just wish there were bigger 'beer' flavors in there to ease the drinkability.

Fresh, mouth-puckering cherry and cranberry puree with some subtle hints of vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Indulgent. Lightly carbonated. Reminded me of a fresh Door County cherry cider with a tart alcoholic bite. The sour and sweetness of the fruit balance each other nicely and make for an easy-drinking desert beer that I could see myself downing a couple bottles of in the course of an evening.

4.42,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5," These guys really get it right with their fruit beers. They seem to find a perfect balance where so many other breweries fall short. This beer is no exception. It pours a beautiful redish brown, cloudy, but in a way that enhances it, not detracts from it. The aroma is all about sour cherries. The flavor follows through with the cherry theme, with just a hint of yeast and underlying grain to remind you that you are drinking a beer. Like the Raspberry this one tastes like real fruit, not syrup or artifical flavoring. These guys take their fruit beers seriously and it shows. These beers rank up there with some of the best beers in the world, IMHO.","petercmartin1","Oct 03, 2005"

There is a good deal of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very very strong, with me getting my first whiff with the glass about 5 feet from my nose. Strong notes of maraschino cherry juice (one of my faves) and just a slight bit of sourness. Amazing. The taste is full of cherry as well, and just a bit of tart flavors going on. It's very sweet as well. I enjoy it, but not nearly as much as the aroma. The mouthfeel is decently strong and smooth for a fruit beer. The drinkability is superb.

4.57,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Reviewed from notes of a 750ml bottle sampled on 1/15/05. The bottle was dipped in red wax. About an inch of light red head formed over the murky dark red body. Some lacing was left as the head stayed in tact. Strong cherry aroma hits you first with a bit of tartness backing it. There is a slight malty sweetness lingering in the back as well. A sweet tart like flavor hits the palate first before all the cherry flavor rushes in. The cherry flavor is great in that tastes like real cherries not sweetened cherry juice or something artificial. A good amount of tartness that lingers for bit rounds this one out. About a medium body to it with an effervescent feel to it. Pretty much what you would hope for with the style. This stuff is hugely drinkable with the tartness being very present but not overpowering and the other flavors complementing each other so well. This would be a regular for me if it was local.

Yeah it's sweet, but in no way cloying as the tart and bubbles wash all that off your buds before it gets a chance to negatively root and then there is even a slight lingering bitter finish and the pull to renew.

Topping this off was a fine and ample whitish head, which left excellent lacing. It looked beautiful in the champagne glasses. The nose was curious and seducing, with notes of fresh tart cherries and cinnamon spice. I don't believe I have ever experienced such a marvelous combonation. The peak of enjoyment came with the flavor. The beer starts with a massive sweet and tart cherry bomb, hitting the palate with tingling fizzy delight. This sensation smoothly transitions into a semi-dry finish with delicious lingering flavors of cherry and subtler winey cinnamon. All of this is perfectly balanced but charged with life, with perfect carbontion and a sleek mouthfeel. The tartness level was much lower than a kriek, but in this case was just right, leaving me completely satisfied and ready to drink another bottle of this if I had one.

Nose is that of ripe cherries, and sweet malt grains, tart and crisp, fresh an appealing like homemade bread fresh from the oven. The front is ambrosial, loaded with malt, the top rich and full, what a treat. Finish has a meaningful acidity with the hops present and delicate in their spiciness, cherry sweetness and flavor carries to the somewhat vinous and dry aftertaste, what a Hoot, and once as with Lambics I shunned this style of beers.

Sour spice and, again of course, cherry. Very smooth on the tongue. Delicious aftertaste that lingers for just the right amount of time. Once it's gone, you want another taste.

4.83,10.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Another brew that lives up to its hype, this kriek-style ale pours a deep red/amber color with a frothy, sparkling wine-like pinkish head. Very impressive looking in a flute glass, this one leaves trails of lace. Smell is tart and almost acidic at first, with some true fruity sweetness coming through thereafter. Taste is similar, but totally unlike any Belgian kriek I've had. Big, monstrous cherry notes hit the palate at first, with a dry, tart and acidic finish. The best way for me to describe it is like cherry pie filling. Cherry pie as in that which your mother would make, not Hostess. Wow. Very complex and if nothing else, divine. Mouthfeel is prickly and effervescent at first when chilled, then somewhat syrupy when it reaches room temperature. Moderate in alcohol, somewhat sweet, somewhat tart, but overly satisfying, this Belgian-style ale drinks incredibly well. Would pair incredibly with the aforementioned cherry pie as an appropriate dessert brew. Better yet, enjoy it by itself. An awesome creation from New Glarus.","Jon","Jul 24, 2003"

4,-8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Reddish (purple?) brown and cloudy with a pinkish cotton candy head. Resembles many mass market fruit Lambics. Good cherry aroma, not at all artificial but with an accurate sense of sweetness and sourness that you taste in real fruit. Some yeasty bready notes, as well. Flavor is very well constructed macerated cherry with skin in a very natural tart state. An accompanying bit of wheaty grain makes for a nice velvety mouthfeel and well matched sense of astringent drying for the finish. Much better than over mass market sweetened Lambics and American fruit Wheats. An overalll winner (still a little too sweet), I am still hoping against all odds that New Glarus one day sells on the other side of the Wisconsin border.","ADR","Jul 15, 2003"
3.82,-12.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I find Belgian Red more of a special occasion dessert beer than anything else. For me it is a bit sweeter and fruitier than I normally like. If I could change anything it would be to make it a bit tarter and a wee bit maltier.","purplehops","Jul 13, 2003"

This beer is a great thirst quencher w/ its cherry sourness. A very nice example of a sour ale.","jcalabre","Jun 02, 2003"
4.22,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Yep, liked it. Extremely fresh. Soft texture, with a wonderfully lightly tart, soft, natural cherry sourness. Never candyish, always natural (except the aroma kinda smelled like lollypops or soemthing). Mix the cherrys in with some light oak and mayne some nuttyness. If i had one complaint it would be that its not assertive enough (more sour, more stink), but hey, the balance couldn't really be any better right? Thanks Feloniousmonk for this truly classic beer.","rastaman","May 22, 2003"
5,14.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Reddish brown color, hazy. Small to no head. Aroma is cherry and malt. WOW.. AND I DO MEAN WOW!! I had this beer several years ago, and while I had no notes on it. It tastes exactly the way I remembered it. Medium bodied. Intense cherry flavor, sweet, sour and tart. There is some malt sweetness as well as hop spiciness as well. Complex and intense flavors. Extremely smooth. Not very beer like, closest style might be a lambic?? But, who cares it tastes amazing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is clean and sweet. World class beer.","beerguy101","May 22, 2003"
4.92,12.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"I love this beer! First you have to consider the elegant packaging... the green 750ml bottle, the red wax, even the label is classy. Then you pour... aroma is a blast of fresh pie cherries. And the color, a hazy beautiful dark pink-red complete with a light pink head which fades quickly. Taste is a refreshing, sweet-tart, complex sour, acetic, cherry flavor. Not for amateurs! My friend and girlfriend didn't really care for it and they gave me theirs. She said the tartness and carbonation reminded her of the inside of Zots candy. More for me! Just one drop of this beer is loaded with flavors. Medium body with a medium, brisk, carbonation accentuating the tartness. I look forward to trying it again at the GABF.","comat0se","May 16, 2003"
4.75,8.4,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"From tiny flower on a tree to a ripe red fruit for use in this wonderful brew, the cherry has not been featured quite like this before. The whole cherry is the star here, skin,fruit,pit, probablly even stem. Poured into a rounded glass, it's the color of ripe cherry red with a very pink and creamy thick head. The aroma is bursting with ripe whole fresh cherrys, pits and all- nothing artificial about it. The flavor follows suit with a sweet and tart whole fresh cherry flavor with a toasted oak finish. It is medium body holds a very rich but refreshing drink. The carbonation is mellow not bubbly, allowing the complex cherry flavor to stand tall.It could have hit a "5" in taste with a little more malt in the backround but I'm not complaining. This is good stuff !! This isn't what you may have had in other fruit beers, this is unique- try it.","jeffboo","May 01, 2003"

4.72,7.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"Taste is a heavenly nice sweetly sour and tart cherry thats easily smooth and a bit like a fruit juice or wine cooler but much nicer flavor. It's medium body and generously carbonated with a huge sweet feel in the front, then just lays down smooth and slightly drying to the finish leaving a great sour tart bite in the back of my mouth. Take a cherry lambic and lighten it up a bit and here ya go, a very interestingly, very drinkable treat of yumminess.","tavernjef","Apr 24, 2003"
4,-8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle, capped coated with red wax, pours a deep reddish brown in color that has a big head that doesn't last, sweet, fruity cherry aroma with a sweet and lightly sour taste of cherries, very carbonated on the tongue, finishes clean and fruity.","maxpower","Apr 06, 2003"
4.79,9.4,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy, cherry red with a slight tawny influence, white head, reached about a ¼ inch before it faded away, soapy remnants, some sporadic spotty lace. Powerful cherry nose, very real in aroma, lively an underlying hint of yeast/wheat can be found, doughy as well. Surprisingly balanced, equally tart as it is sweet the cherry flavor dominates but with faint hints of dough and wheat. Surprisingly dry, cleanish finish with a pleasant aftertaste -- alcoholic cherries. The carbonation is perfect. Wisconsin Belgian Red is truly mouthwatering good. Purchased in Madison, WI.","bditty187","Mar 23, 2003"
4.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a hazy, red-amber with good off-white foam that leaves nice lace down the glass (a flute, in this case). The smell was very pleasant: cherries, citrus, and a hint of spice. The taste was sweet and tart cherries with a little hint of cinnamon. Not too sweet, not too tart. The mouthfeel was creamy with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a very nice and refreshing cherry ale. I enjoyed it very much. I can see why this is an award winner.","UncleJimbo","Mar 14, 2003"
4,-8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"I kind of liked the bottle. Label even looks kind of old fashioned like a early 1900s european wine ad. Hazy medium red w/ ok head. Aroma is big fruity cherry and floury wheat. Big juicy cherry up front, tart finish. Very active carbonation tingles the tongue and complements the cherry acidity nicely.","aracauna","Feb 16, 2003"
4.52,3.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a cherryish,hazy dark brown with a head that is quick to come and go. Aroma is intoxicatingly filled with cherries and a underlying sweetness. I was hoping this would not be nearly as sweet as the Lindeman's kriek and was quite pleased to find out it is the opposite. Cherry and sweet flavors lay on top of what is a quite pleasing sourness. The sourness does just enough to make sure that the beer does not end up tasting to much out of whack. A great feat by the brewer. Drinkability is a little low due to the intense flavors on this beer.","jreitman","Feb 15, 2003"
5,14.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This is the perfect beer to replace wine at the dinner table with Thanksgiving Turkey. Or great to share with a loved one on Valentine's Day.

4.54,3.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy brownish red with a reddish white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is awesome. Smells like a Cherry Crisp fresh out of the oven; tartness of the cherries mingled with the sweetness of the brown sugar and cinnamon. I could sniff this one endlessly. Taste is dominated by cherries, but a wonderful balance between sweet and tart has been struck. Medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is maintained by the balance between the sweetness and tartness; my 750ml bottle was gone too quickly. While I'd still prefer a good IPA or porter overall, this is a very good beer that is excellent within it's style and can make for a nice change of pace.","PhantomVodoo","Jan 18, 2003"
5,14.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This is a nearly perfect example of what craft brewing can produce, given the skills of an expert brewer, the use of exceptional local ingredients, and a daring to try something unique.

4.85,10.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is by far the best fruit beer I have tried. Pours red...cherry aroma...high carbonation.

4.95,13,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Luscious cranberry-like red hue.  Unbelievable aroma.  Great cranberry/vanilla sweet smell with quite a bit of cherry too.  It's a sweet aroma, but not a malty sweet aroma.  Fruity sweet.  The taste is exceptional.  Woody, vinous, dry and of course, loads of cherry.  This is one of my all-time favorites and it never fails.  Every time I have had this, it has been exceptional.  A true classic.","Bighuge","Apr 21, 2002"
