4.12,36.4,4,5,4,3.25,3.75,"I would say this is a good summer beer. Slightly sweet but doable. Refreshing, but sort of bitter. It's smells like a creamsicle with a dry orange peely taste. I could see myself drinking this beer, but I would prefer a shandy. This just simply comes down to preference. When it comes down to a fruity beer I would prefer a lemon to an orange. Overall a good beer, just not something I would buy a lot of.","Sky","Jun 29, 2014"

It's actually not a bad orange flavor. There is just something too much like candy about this. I would not want to drink a pint, but it's hard to fault the general beeriness of it.

Smell is of malt, grain, orange zest, and yeast. There is a slight vomit-like smell that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrusy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that drinks better cold and gets worse as it warms up.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 22, 2013"

Not really sure I dig the smell of bread crammed into orange soda...its the yeast smell in particular that seems to clash. The flavor and texture resembles a thinner wheat beer with a significant 'cooked' sort of canned / vegetal orange flavor which also clashes for my palate against the base beer. At least the carbonation is adequate, unfortunately the body is too thin and watery. I probably won't be visiting this one ever again, not a real fan of it. Not a -horrible- beer, but definitely somewhat worse than mediocre.","WastingFreetime","Jul 07, 2012"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, orange, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Nothing really stood out on this one at all for me from other brews of the same style. There are so many good brews in this style, it would be hard to do so, but this one felt like it didn't even make an effort. Yes, the orange was there. Yes, the cream was there. But that's it?

The label says "ale brewed with honey, orange peel, natural flavors, and orange flower extract added". I think I can taste them all. Mouthfeel is fine for a cream ale perhaps a bit overly carbonated. Overall an interesting beer and well crafted for what it is. This beer is brewed by Pyramid Brewing Co. for Buffalo Bill's Brewery somewhere on the West Coast.

This is a relatively easy to drink "beer" due to the watery-ness and lack of carbonation. I was hoping for more of a "cream ale" as it is advertised, but ended up with a Zima-like brew.

The flavor is similar, all orange and honey but the beer is poorly balanced, no hops to be detected and pretty weak malt as well.

No lacing was left as I sip this down. The beer has a strong aroma of sweet candied orange and honey with soft floral notes...somewhat sweet but not bad at all. The first sip shows a beer with a very light body which is suprisingly refreshing. The highly carbonated brew's flavor is dominated by orange and floral flavors with tones of crisp honey. There is very little malt or hop character apparent in this brew...very light body and almost no bitterness. Flavor leads from floral orange to slight residual sweetness, but is matched by alcohol and maybe just enough hops to cover sweetness as the brew finishes pretty clean, but with no bitterness/drying.

I can't help but describe the aroma further as being that of a bottle of Flinstone's crewable vitamins. Body is thin with orange flavoring and a watery presence amidst some generic, nondescript malt sweetness. Faint suggestions of orange blossom, but you really have to search your tastebuds for it. A nice bit of orange rind tartness in the finish is about a positive of a spin I can think of for this beer. Not entirely pleasant, but not repulsive either. Carbonation is dull, which is a shame because a smooth, creamy texture to the carbonation could have fared this ale nicely.

The taste is thin and tart. Definitely tastes like orange soda more than beer. Acidic with the slightest hint of malt. No hop character present here at all. And with a very thin mouthfeel, it's hardly what I would call a "cream ale." They might as well put this in cans and sell it in vending machines with the other sodas. This is hardly drinkable, and I think my "average" ratings for appearance and smell are somewhat generous. The only thing right about the title of this beer is the orange part. The rest is misleading. Unless you like your beer to taste like orange soda, avoid this beer at all costs.","Atlas1","Apr 09, 2007"

Once again, no real hops/malt in the taste of this beer. Mouthfeel is pretty light and thin, not much to it. I guess if you like watered down orange creamsickles you'll like this, but I'm not impressed by this at all. However, it does go down kinda easy but it's not exactly what I'd call drinkable.

I think orange flavors, if done well, could marry interestingly with citric hop flavors, but in this case there aren't any hop flavors to speak of. I had a delicious dinner tonight and this sweet confection has obliterated all memory of it. The "cream" in the title is nowhere to be found; the beer is decidedly slick and fizzy. If you want beer, stay away. If you want a soda pop type beverage, you might like this.

2.94,-2.6,3,4,3,2,2,"I won't drink buy this one again, but for it's category it's OK...light orange color....no head...big orange gatorade smell...taste is not as big as the nose but a nice orange flavor...the honey is very light if at all noticable...it feels very thin and watery (perhaps by design)...Not my thing but for a fruit beer it at least smells and tastes like oranges....with a few tweaks it could be average....I'd suggest a fuller body....a bigger honey presence...and a slight softening of the big orange nose...","ZAP","Jun 17, 2004"
4.24,40.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Wow was I suprised by this beer. I've had this in my fridge for about 2 months and finally decided this hot sweaty day was the day for this beer. Pours an amber/orange with a semi white/tan head that rose 2 inches then vanished into a little puddle of white. The lacing was average, it was traceable at best. The smell is a strong blast of orange citrus, it smells like an orange soda mixed with cream soda. Unbeliavably refreshing to the nose. The taste is phenomenal, upfront is a sweet orange/cream and in the rear is slight hops. The only downfall is that the sweetness is a little to much and the hops are almost untraceable to the tongue. This is a great summer beer, on this site it says winter but I can still find this in certain stores here in June so I don't know what the deal is with that. This is by far the best fruit beer I have ever had, I agree if you don't like orange/cream sodas you probably won't like this beer. Great for summer BBQ's.","beertaster13","Jun 15, 2004"

3.41,12.9,2.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Is it orange soda or beer? ... ... You decide! It smells, and to a certain extent (it's not THAT sweet) tastes, like orange soda. Fanta, perhaps? Of course, an orange soda would hold a better head. But I digress. I actually liked this beer! It's an interesting and refreshing change of pace that should work very well on a hot summer's day in between brews. Some might reach for a malternative, but not me...

I found the smell quite pleasant. Taste, again is dominated by orange up front (but it's not sweet or syrupy) with a little mildly malty beer flavor in the background. Fizzy mouthfeel. Slightly sour aftertaste. I'd say this is OK to try once for the novelty, but it won't be one of my regulars!","jimdkc","May 25, 2004"
3.61,19.5,2.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Even with a vigorous pour, this beer has no head retention. Pours an orangey amber, with a lot of carbonation. Very nice Orange smell, with a subtle hint of honey. Tastes better than most cream ales, as it is dominated by a strong orange flavor, which is appealing to me, but can be overpowering. Due to the carbonation, the mouthfeel is more akin to a Coke than an ale, and even with vigorous agitation, the carbonation stays. I could definitely see drinking a few of these on a warm summer day on the front porch, and besides the pour, this beer is relatively well done. Plus the bottle has pretty frickin' cool artwork.","nortmand","May 24, 2004"

Too light bodied, minimal finish...there's probably a lot of folks out there who'd dig this (girly-girls, panty-waists, Nancy-boys, sissy-pants), but not me, brother, not me.","feloniousmonk","Apr 23, 2004"

You see, the thing is...this beer doesn't taste like beer. It's like mixing one part Hi-C to one part Miller Lite. Not good. Very weak and watery in the mouthfeel and flavor.

Uh oh, you can smell children's aspirin from two feet away. A little more genuine on a deep inhalation. Oddly sticky and slick, mouthfeel and flavor is compromised by the odd mixture of OK orange, pineapple, slickness, and distilled water. Doesn't really compose itself in the mouth, wanders in varied directions. Slightly medicinal close with lots of orange to the aftertaste. If you like straight up sweet orange, this is actually better from the bottle -- where it doesn't open up and the citrus is concentrated. Strictly me, but I can't recommend this one.","ADR","Mar 27, 2004"
3.25,7.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This is one odd beer...if you want to even call it that. It was sort of like tang and seltzer or something. Okay, so, it poured with a clear orangy gold color which was kind of pretty. The head was gone in a flash. The aroma was very tang-like based on old memories of tang, which really didn't bother me, but it didn't smell like fresh orange. This definitely tasted orange (tang that is), and I could taste the honey in my first sip, but not after that. I think there may have been more orange extract used than the orange peel, so maybe that was why the tang taste prevailed. It left a very clean aftertaste, and was actually rather "quaffable", since it really tasted more like soda than beer. I will give a positive spin to all this to say that if you have friends who drink like tequiza (sp), you may want to give them this beer and it will be a more interesting alternative.","gueuzegeek","Mar 24, 2004"
3.32,9.9,3.5,4,3,2.5,3.5,"Quite an odd brew. Pours a clear orange with a white head that had no intention of sticking around. Very strong aroma of oranges supported with some hints of malt. The medium-bodied mouthfeel is way too carbonated. It reminded me of drinking orange soda. Flavors of sweet orange and honey dominate the front. Some malt flavors begin to emerge midway through. Finish is pretty non-descript. Not overly complex and non-offensive (if you like orange flavor). This would be a great summer refresher.","Winter","Mar 21, 2004"

The taste is very much like a very watered down orange soda with only a hint of any malt or hops at all. It is a very light bodied brew that finishes lightly sweet. Now that description said, drinkability is through the roof! Its as if the flavor is so faint, yet so smooth with almost zero evidence of alcohol, you just drink like Gatorade on a hot day.

Up front, a blast of orange peels dominate the palate; maybe some honey and lemon/zesty notes. The orange malty (?) body becomes creamy, true to the name; slightly carbonated. Other than, you guessed, the orange peel, this is pretty much a one-sided brew. Tastes resemble an orange soda or orange hard candy.

The beer looks ok-clean golden color with a slightly above average bit of lace and considerable stick. My problem is with the rest of the drink. The nose is more akin to a soda than a beer. It lacks any finesse or restraint and seems to be trying to appeal to the folks who don't really like beer, but want to be drinking one with the rest of the gang-kind of like a white zinfandel of the beer world. The flavors are candied orange and then cloying malt that come off in a sweet and sour sort of way that to me just doesn't work. The more ya drink the less you want.

It's quite fun to smell it actually, and a touch of honey is in there too. Fizzy carbonation makes the mouthfeel kind of odd and a bit like soda. Orange peel dominates the flavor. Honey is in there a bit, and adds a certain smoothness. It's an interesting beer and very easy to drink. But the aftertaste is quite annoying, kind of like chewing on an orange peel. This aftertaste alone knocks down drinkability and taste. An odd beer, here.","AudioGilz","Feb 17, 2004"

Smell: Minimal malt/hops aroma- fresh bright orange peel (but a little sweeter than peel) is the dominant aroma (it reminds me of the smell of my fingers after I use them to break open a sweet orange). Taste: A very refreshing, creamy flavor that has both the sweetness and tang of orange fruit. The orange flavor lasts a while after the the swallow. Very drinkable. I first tried this a few months ago, and I keep returning to it on a once in a while basis- It's not a remarkable beer, but it is just easy to drink and enjoyable.
