OCCASION: Gatsby 2012....bring it on, Baz!...APPEARANCE: crystal clear, faintly tinted in yellow, with rapid effervescence; thick yet bubbly white head...odd, misshapen lacing... AROMA: pungent, offish skunky funk that suggests a fruity failure--not saying any more than this... PALATE: soft, bubbly, thin and drinkable--almost refreshing, but more like weakly flavored water... TASTE: mostly acquiescent light beer malt tendencies, with a tinge of blackberry--rather flat... OVERALLL: a weak, cleansing, warm weather wheat that doesn't distinguish itself; such a slight turn of berry that only faintly offers flavor, and what is offered is annoying....","dacrza1","Jun 11, 2014"

No noticeable hop or malt profile, but the blackberries remain restrained and it finishes dry and crisp. Ideal for a hot summer day. Very drinkable and refreshing. If we are honest, this beer, at 110 calories and 4% abv, is light years better than any mass produced light beer. It's better than some new session IPAs too and many other fruit/wheat craft beers. Sadly it lacks the hops to sell anymore and so must be retired. I wonder what will take its place as a bridge beer.","HuskyHawk","Jun 07, 2014"

Very good as a post skiing or hiking beer, or even for after eating. I suggest it be served around 40 degrees. It seems to be as good out of the tap/ in a glass as it is in a bottle, so don't worry about that, but make sure you haven't had a dark beer before this (it diminishes the taste). Really one of the better flavored beers I've ever had and 100% worth taking sip of if you're just coming from a fun outdoor sport","Owl-Head","Jan 06, 2014"

The smell is somewhat offputting with a distinct but faint presence of rotten fruit. The odor is likely stronger when the beer is not chilled to 38F, but I'd be hard-pressed to describe it as "aroma". This only gets worse when you taste it. Although not overwhelming, the constant presence of musty black-grape flavor is distracting and bothersome, but is clearly meant to be a "feature". The rest of the flavor is missing in action -- taste more like flavored mineral water with a drop of cheap vodka. In some parallel universe it may give Leinie a run for its money--but not in mine (and I can't drink Leinie with a straight face). This alone would make me think twice about buying LT. I was initially unimpressed with LT festival samples but wanted to give them a full try. This appears to be the worst of mediocre lineup.","VictorWisc","Jun 23, 2013"

3.41,9.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours kristelweiss clear and yellow, like some very clean dehydrated pee. The head on top is huge and snow white, with finely packed bubbles, but a lumpy exterior. The beer’s body is as clean as a hospital, with a light torrent of carbonation bubbles working their way to the top of the glass. The lacing on the edges of the glass is medium to thick, sticky, and quite patchy. On the nose, the beer smells of damp wheat with a light spice note, and plenty of tart and syrupy sweet blackberry smells. On the tongue, the beer tastes cleanly of wheat bread and sweet black berries. The beer begins with damp and bitter bland wheat before opening into a more welcoming biscuity flavor with a very light spice from the yeast, and then crescendoing with the syrupy blackberry taste that is sweet and pleasing. The close of the beer is far more pleasant than the opening, with light lingering wheat flavors, and a very light sweet tang of blackberries. In the mouth, the beer feels very clean, and of a lighter body, with some very nice velvety carbonation bubbles, and a refreshing kick in the back of the throat. The mouth is left a little dry and sticky, strangely, but the throat is left feeling quite refreshed. Overall, this is a light fruit beer that I really don’t mind drinking a lot of. Longtrails website says this beer originated from the concept of Belgiums lambic beers, but I see it as far more akin to a crisp kellerweiss, and I think they should start marketing it that way. The beer is great for a summer day when you want something a little sweet to refresh the tongue.","Maxwell","Jan 01, 2013"

I went with an initial inverted Glug, resulting in two fingers of massive, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled faintly of berries and I remember this being a knock against this beer - not enough Ooomph in terms of its fruitiness. Mouthfeel was light, not watery, but close and the lightness of the fruit combined nicely with the inherent tang of the wheat, but I just felt like it had been dialed down from what it could have been. Finish was dry and refreshing, which may be appropriate for the beach, but I just was not feelin' it.","woodychandler","Aug 05, 2012"

Taste is actually much more subtle on the fruit than I expected, and in fact if I hadn't seen the label said blackberry I'm not sure I would have guessed that was the fruit. Taste has a slight edge on BMC mass-produced beers and the fruit addition is comparable to pretty much a blueberry beer. There's a mild bitter finish.","MoreThanWine","Jul 31, 2011"

Expected a more wheaty beer, it is refreshingly light and crisp though, with a dry, tart finish.

Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose expresses a citrus quality intermingled with berries and a light wheat character. Taste is somewhat bland and watery - the berry flavor is all but gone, with a faint wheat malt presence coming out towards the back. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with a watery consistency and a lively carbonation. Not a terrible offering, but there's just much going on here.

The flavor brings a firm rice cereal wheat with a tasteful cherry-like berry overtone. Although there is a fair amount of lively carbonation evident, it quickly washes away into a fairly watery feeling brew, thin, very drinkable if you like these flavors. There is a faint citrus hop dryness in the finish that gets your tongue. With the right mindset, this isn't a bad fruit flavored beer, something for the picnic or golf outing perhaps. Not a mouth watering choice though.","Durge","May 31, 2010"

A typical American fruit infused wheat ale, this is probably a blackberry flavoring added it's not overly sweet, which is a good thing. Light biscuit malts and a sharp slight citrus wheat tanginess comes together with the berry acidity and tart components to make a decent but boring one dimensional flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation tickles the back of the throat the finish is heavy with carbonation in the back of the throat it pretty much clears the palate of the flavor.

It's light, good for the summer, but the taste is lacking, there is not much complexity, and the only thing I can really taste is the blackberry.

Not a lot of "wheat" characteristics at all present. It would have been nicer if this beer had a bit more backbone and then maybe I would have enjoyed the berry flavor a bit more.

Aroma is strong in sweet fruity blackberries, with a soft wheat behind it. Not a lot going on, but there is truth in advertising. The flavor is more focused on the wheat than the berries, but the berry is still prevalent. The wheat comes across very neutral. I find the flavor to be somewhat reserved. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a solid carbonation. This one certainly is a fruit beer and I can imagine the market for it. This one is very neutral in the beer base with a pretty mild fruit. I feel that the blackberry could have been a touch more pervasive in the flavor. This is a very easy drinking brew. It is something that will appeal to a wide variety of folks that might not drink many other brews. I enjoy it, but it just feels like it is holding back a little in order to have wider appeal.","kmpitz2","Jun 23, 2007"

The longer I drink this beer the more pronounced the blackberry flavor becomes, at first it was quite subdued, by the end of the bottle it was dominant. Mouthfeel is ok. Considering there isn't much of a standard in this "style" I'll just rate on my opinion. Body was light, extremely light. This could very well have been flavored water. Carbonation was excesssive at first but disappated and by the time I finished (just a matter of minutes) it was at a low to moderate level. In terms of drinkability this beer isn't all that bad.

The taste was lightly malty with a light hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and tangy with medium-light body and medium carbonation. It was dry overall with a hoppy and fruity aftertaste. This was a decent beer -- lightly fruity and easy to drink.","UncleJimbo","Aug 28, 2004"

4.05,30.2,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"It is still a light gold color with very little head yet a decent amount of carbonation. The wheat is evident from the start and the blackberry flavor comes through immediately afterwards. It is not an overpowering berry flavor which is a big plus but I felt like this years berry flavor was more faint than in past years. I still do like to get a good berry rush without it being overpowering. It is still a great Summer beer and goes real well with spicy food. The berry flavor seems to cut the spiciness of food quite well. I remember in past years thinking that the draft version was always a little better than the bottled one. However, I am not sure if I will have a chance to try the draft version this year. Still, a real good bottled beer that I wish was more readily available in the Boston area.","rousee","Aug 18, 2004"

Well it didn't hold up to expections. Pour out a straw color with some decent size head that settled down eventually. Smell was rather weak. Some blackberries in there but quite light. Taste was light as well. It's almost like a fruit flavored macro. Aftertaste was quite watery as well. Pass on this one.

Aroma is lightly sprinkled with blackberries and faint grain/cereal. Berry tartness greets with the first sip along with some light wheat grain. The finish is dry and crisp. Admittedly, I am not a fan of these light wheat beers. However, even the wife, who typically enjoys this style in the summer, thought this was rather weak.","John","May 19, 2004"

At first it seemed to be interesting, but a third of the way threw it lost me. Not a great brew in my books, but fruit flavored brews have never been my thing.

Not that its that bad, its just so light that it tastes like a quality fruit beer thats been cut with bud. Ill pass.","taez555","May 13, 2004"

It's light and refreshing. There has a wheat taste with a very weak blackberry flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very average fruit beer. My advice: add more fruit and increase the ratio of wheat malts to pale base grains. There is hardly any flavor here. If this didn't say blackberry on the bottle I never would have known.","WesWes","Jan 13, 2004"

While my friends give me shit for liking fruity beers, this is one of my all time favorites. The flavor cannot be matched by any other fruit brew i've ever tried. It poured with a minimal head but with an excellent amber color. The fruit taste is not overwhelming like many others which makes them very drinkable. I could down a few 6-packs in an evening without getting sick of the taste.","PaleAleHater","Nov 14, 2003"

2.3,-26,3,3,2,2,2,"There is something about fruit beers that I just don't like. With the Blackbeary Wheat it was the overall taste and mouthfeel. The pour was straight golden with not too much in the way of head and no lace to speak of. Smell was dominitated by Blackbeary, but that is to be expected. The taste was nothing but glorified, berry flavored selzter water. No malts, no hops, no nothing. Just very corbonated water. If I want that I'll buy Poland Spring. I wouldn't mind seeing a fruit beer that had a thicker more maltier taste with just a slight aromoa of the designated fruit. I trust that this beer is not indicitive of the entire Longtrail line.","GreatPondBrewer","Jun 27, 2003"

Aroma is soft and crisp, with a hint of blackberries - not as much as I expected. The same is true with the flavor as the fruit taste is much more slight than say, Pete's Strawberry Blond. The majority of the flavor is like a mix between a pilsner and a wheat ale, with a sweetness of blackberry on the far finish. The mouthfeel is very light and bubbly, goes good with the style. I think an unfiltered version of this would add to the character, but this is a good light drinking summer beer that anyone would enjoy.","nixhecks","Jun 03, 2003"

The taste; well I didn't find that there was much of one. There was a hint of blackberry, thankfully not as strong as the smell, and then there was some malt, but nothing all that interesting. I was hoping for some nice yeasty and wheaty flavor, but I didn?t find it. This particular bottle also seemed a bit flat, and didn't give much for mouth feel.

Beer seemed flat and the flavor, though sweet with a bit of malt and berry fruitiness, seemed a bit weak and watery. Other than the smell, I wasn't much impressed with this.
