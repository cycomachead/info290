I got a six pack for free from a friend and wanted to see what the hype was about. This beer is for the folks who want to drink a beer that doesn't taste like a beer. Not a fan of this one. I hate to give this  beer a bad rating but I just don't like this type of beer. Think of it as apple juice mix with a little sour sour apple and carbonation that's what this beer taste like.","B4PTSD","Mar 27, 2015"

5,85.9,5,5,5,5,5,"This is hard apple cider brewed like ale. You can't compare it with beer or traditional ale. As a hard cider it has an excellent flavor and finish. It tastes like fresh batch cider before it begins to get bitter with age. I personally can't compare it with beer or ale because they are completely different animals. As a cider it is wonderful but as a beer it is terrible. It's like expecting steak and tasting shrimp.","don1951","Mar 21, 2014"

I found that I have to finish these quickly due to the better tasting part disappearing so quickly. The smell is that of sort sort of chemical mixed with low quality apple juice. Just by reading some small print at the bottom of the sticker on the bottle, one can see that Redd's Apple Ale is an "Ale with natural apple flavor and caramel coloring." Immediately this made me realize that I'm most likely drinking unhealthy high fructose corn syrup (Just speculation), and most likely some sort of strong apple concentrate. However, I would recommend this to someone who wants the alcohol content of beer, but can't stand the taste. It falls into the same category as a Mike's Hard Lemonade, but I personally believe that it doesn't have the flavor to compete.","AstronomySloth","Aug 08, 2013"

Apples like the freeze dried kind found in Quaker oatmeal mashes up with some light malt sweetness and a faint spice. It's not horribly fake tasting or at all offensive.

Flavor is mild hard apple cider mixed with light sweet malt. The same oddly flavored interaction between the malt and the apple juice flavors affects the taste as well. Light bodied. The flavor combination did not work for me, but fortunately, it is all so attenuated in flavor that it is not difficult to finish. I was also lucky that we got our first really warm day, so a cheap, light tasting 16 oz. can filled a niche in the day. I was fooled into to buying this beer from the "new" brewery "Redd's Brewing". I now know this is one the of the many BMG fake brewery names. The good news is that at least I have reviewed my first Miller product. Tick. Glad I did this one after mowing the grass, it was at least refreshing while dehydrated.","LiquidAmber","Apr 30, 2013"

Definitely tastes like a cider. I like the sharp feeling carbonation, making the mouth feel rating for me very high. Nothing great overall, but it's not half bad.","teds101","Apr 28, 2013"

Aromas of apple sweetness, with not much else behind it. Cloying, oversweet nose. Flavors of apple tart and sweetness, with a slide unbalance to the sweet side. Leans itself more towards a cider than an ale based on the palate. The aftertaste is slightly spiced with light cinnamon, but the apple tart and sweetness overtakes anything as you drink. Sweet, cloying finish that is lightened by the carbonation. The sweetness builds as you drink, which can overpower and make this beer difficult to session.","GarthDanielson","Apr 03, 2013"

The taste pretty much brings more of the same, but with an increased sense of blandness. Honestly, I expected a cider-like quality of apple with some spices or something, but this takes the spice-less path and them some. To sum: watered-down apple juice that wasn't all that great to begin with. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a feel I can only describe as sorta/kinda creamy. Overall, I just didn't get this beer. It certainly eschews the cider route, but it also goes away from the apple-y beer route as well, coming across as, like I've said before, a watered-down version of apple juice.
