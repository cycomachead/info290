3.78,32.6,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"I allowed my love of a bargain to overtake my love of beer on this one as I picked up an assorted 12 pack of Magic Hat "Summer Scene". That is the reason why I am staring at what is essentially a purple colored beer. But given the fact that the beer is called Wacko, I have nobody to blame but myself. The smell is what one might encounter at an overpriced candy store in some touristy area, an artificial yet enjoyable sugary fruitiness, much like taffy. The sugary fruitiness continued into the taste, but was joined with an earthy maltiness. The mouthfeel had very much a fluffy dessert feel to it. Despite my initial hesitation, once I let go of my preconceptions/pretentions, I actually quite enjoyed this beer. There is a solid base to this beer beneath its initial appearance. I could seriously consider sessioning this sometime.","anglagard1","Aug 07, 2011"
3.12,9.5,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall, this is decent fare, having many good flavors and characteristics, but lacks something to set it apart from the field, and begs for a shot of brown sugar and at least a light hop kick. Good beach fare, then, but not something to take to a beer tasting.","jondeelee","Aug 05, 2011"
3.08,8.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"The aroma translates almost exactly to the taste. Adjunct lager-like corn malt taste with an interesting vegetable flavor. I'm guessing beets again, but I'm not quite certain. Some hops add a touch of bitterness, but it lingers throughout the taste and finish, leading to a dry finish and aftertaste. The aftertaste is somewhat odd as well, with that vegetable taste lingering. Its refreshing for sure, but I can think of a lot of refreshing beers that I like the taste of better. Great bottle cap though of course: "Banana costumes, by nature, are funny." Made me chuckle.","chodinheaven","Aug 04, 2011"
2.06,-27.7,3,2,2,2,2,"Reddish copper in color, the beer pours with very little head, and it produced no lacing at all. The aroma and flavor are both somewhat off-feeling, with a tart twang and that malty/adjuncty character that reminds me of cheap kegs in college. Getting past that, there is a touch of caramel. Some sweet vegetal notes come through, but really, it just doesn't work all that well. Vegetal hops are a no-no. I feel the same about beets in my beer. I'm not Dwight Schrute. Off flavors in the finish. Not diggin this, though it is much better straight from the bottle.","NittanyBeerFan","Aug 01, 2011"

I don’t really know what to make of it. The aroma is downright disgusting. The taste is strange, with hops and malt hinting at the start but beets taking over. The lack of carbonation hurts what would otherwise be an interesting, albeit Wacko, diversion.","eclaycamp","Jul 22, 2011"

3.36,17.9,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep ruby red with a thin lacing of head that disappears quickly. Smell is sweet and yeasty. Taste is an odd blend of malt and beets with a mild bitterness at the very end. The beets hang on in the aftertaste. The beet flavor actually is as well blended into this beer as beets could possibly be. Light to medium bodied and nicely carbonated.","tdm168","Jul 19, 2011"

2.95,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,3,"As a summer beer, it’s suitably refreshing, but it could be more flavorful. For this summer, it would be great if it came with a frozen glass, or person with a giant fan-shaped leaf, or winter.","TheBeerAlmanac","Jul 17, 2011"
3.17,11.2,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"A peculiar rosy amber color, with a weak, slightly pink scattered head that spreads to the edges after a few minutes, and little or no traces of laces. The aroma is a peculiar mineral/minty-evergreen and bubblegum. Just hard to describe. Not immediately alluring but okay. The flavor follows suit but brings in more evidence of malt and maybe even what I might call a hint of clove and sweet grass hop. There’s a dry bite to it at the front. It has quite a bit going on but at the end of the day it’s an odd sort of lager that’s a little too bubblegum sweet for my tastes in this sort of style. It’s medium-light bodied with a tiny bubbled, fizziness in feel. Refreshing, an alright summer beer, drinkable enough but not something I will rush back for.","Durge","Jul 15, 2011"
3.31,16.1,3,2,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Wacko has a really good taste to it, very refreshing on a summer afternoon. I wouldn't drink this regularly all year long, but I can see myself getting more of this next summer.","mdunman","Jul 14, 2011"

Taste pretty much the same, alot of Caramel and chocolate to my palate but thats alright,a hint of beets that ins't my favorite ( i think they taste like dirt) pretty thick (for a summer for me), not really what I'm interested in when I think of a summer seasonal, I would enjoy this much more in the winter of late fall, all in all pretty solid, just not for the summer.","callmeclemens","Jul 11, 2011"
2.77,-2.8,2.5,3,3,2,2.5,"This beer is bright red in color, which is concerning off the bat. It is colored with beets and you can certainly taste the sugar right off the bat and it follows through the whole beer experience, which is a bit much even for someone who likes a sweeter beer. First taste impression is sweet, followed a feel of having a sugary drink in your mouth and then leaves you with an aftertaste of sugar. Had it both in bottles and on tap. On tap was at least a bit better as it seemed to balance the sweetness a little more throughout but still was a bit much. Would be good to those who like a super sweet summer beer.","Ahoyhoyindeed","Jul 10, 2011"

Yeah its a safe beer for such an outlandish one and I think this is what peoples main problem with it is. They are expecting this unique knock your socks off dare I say off centered ale but instead get a very subtle flavoring profile which I think when recognized is pretty damn good. This is a really good sessionable beer as well as its light in the mouth and alcohol. Is it the best summer beer? no but is it worth getting a six pack of this summer?

1.86,-34.7,3.5,2.5,1,2.5,2,"So, yeah, I'm sure the score is a major tip-off that I did not enjoy this beer. Worse, it all started out so well. I saw it on the shelf at one of my local haunts and thought, "Hm, that sounds interesting. Let's give it a go." After chilling it for a few days (there's a lot of beer in that fridge, OK?), I finally got around to pouring the damn thing. It was clear, the color of a nice blood orange, and had a head made of about a finger of quick-dying white micro-foam. It seemed as though the beets were doing their job well, making a festive, interesting appearance. Things began to go sideways when my 'strils got involved. The bit of citrus hops was the only saving grace here. Unfortunately, from behind them rose some funky wheat, bad puffed rice (I didn't know that could go bad...), and a scent warning me of an impending vegetable zombie attack. I knew that damn disposal didn't work well enough. Still believing myself the Shackleford of beer, I pressed on into the foreboding taste. Big mistake. The vegetable zombies struck, a V-8 executive's acid-induced coma nightmare. He knew the vengeance was pending, but just kept convincing himself it was an impossibility. Foolish man. My taste buds were pelted with orange peels that had been urinated on by a demon; grass left over from a hippie's orgy-tastic sex tape filming; hard water; and the very salad Ngo Dinh Diem was scarfin' on when he was assassinated. I'd love to know how much they paid for that last one on E-Bay. The body was a mercifully light medium (any thicker and I may not have been able to survive), with a seemingly oppressive carbonation and a dry finish. I applaud the creativity and find the use of new and different ingredients to be a noble (is that the word?) endeavor, but this experiment has gone terribly awry. [rec] awry. I've had worse, but not many. I will say, though, it's worth a try, even if it will most likely end up down the drain loike mine. Every beer is worth a shot.

Not necessarily offensive, certainly unique, just not appealing to me. Smooth medium body with fairly high carbonation, flavor follows the nose, very earthy and vegetable like. Actually taste is more appealing to me than aroma suggested and has a slight hop presence in finish. As this warms up I start to get a little more of a a sweet, mildly fruit like presence in the body before the drier, slightly unpleasant vegetable/beet finish.

I expected more of a beet presence to it, what I found was the malts and grains were the dominant force in the taste, with beet flavoring giving it a kick, and a bite to the end of it.

It tastes like sweet malt, grain, and a weird unnatural sickeningly sweet flavor that I'm not sure what it is. I assume it's from the beets/beet sugar, but I don't know for sure. I just know I don't like it. There's also a weird aftertaste that isn't appealing. Mouthfeel/body is light, but it's not watery and has decent carbonation.

Perhaps its magic hat pandering to its more hipster beer drinking crowd instead of real beer drinkers, but they've gone down a notch in my book, at least HiPA is still good.","onthefarside","Beers"

2.67,-6.3,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Okay, this beer is just silly. Beetjuice for color? What's the point. This came in a mixed 12 summer pack so I drank one. I wouldn't say it's a drainpour, but it doesn't really have anything to recommend it either. Pours an orange/pinkish-red with no head beyond a thin ring. Smells vaguely fruity and a tad dusty. Tastes light, fizzy, slightly fruity, dusty, and slightly bitter and metallic on the finish. Pretty blah. Carbonated and slightly bitter and artificial in the mouth. The beetjuice does nothing for this beer but add some dusky notes and an artificial color, and there isn't much else there either. I'll avoid this in the future.","Georgiabeer","Apr 21, 2009"
2.12,-25.6,4,2,2,2,2,"I bought a six of this even after reading the label to see it is beet red in color which makes it hard to take serious when you pour it into a glass. It didn't taste absolutely horrible and I'm sure people that don't really like the taste of strong beer will like it. People who like wine coolers and things like Bud Light would probably love this. If you prefer a good ale, porter, or stout (or fall or winter beer) then this is not for you...","Tomdee74","Apr 20, 2009"
3.24,13.7,4,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Eventually the head turns white and the beer mellows out to just a pinkish read. Not much there aroma wise. I must also say I've never tried a beet before, so I'm not sure of its taste. But, this beer has a nice mouthfeel and is nice and smooth and easy to drink. Has a nice fruity sort of flavor to it, but not over the top at all. Sort of like #9 just with beets I suppose. To sum it up, it's an easy drinking beer that is light bodied and good. I don't know what else people are expecting from a summer beer but there it is.","oriolesfan4","Apr 19, 2009"

3.51,23.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: I don't know why all the bashing on this offering, sure it's not Magic Hat's best beer but it's a fairly decent one at that, it's easy to drink, refreshing, and features enough elements to make it easily better then alot of other fruit engulfed beers on the market today. Don't know if I'd get another 6 pack of it, but if offered, I would easily have another one.","thespaceman","Apr 18, 2009"

2.21,-22.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,2,"The taste is quite nasty. What were they thinking. This tastes like really lousy ale with a bunch of coloring and flavorings added. The underneath is a dry and poorly crafted maltiness, and on top is just some awful fruit adjunct. The beer is part dry, part sweet, none too refreshing. The mustiness just lingers all the way through. What a disappointment. This is a drain pour for me.","albern","Apr 16, 2009"

3.78,32.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This is a strange beer. It is redish pink. I thought I have seen everything until I poured this beer. The appearance is cool. The smell is like a slightly sweet beet. The taste is not bad. There is a very slight hoppiness and a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good too. This beer is not as crisp as the packaging says but it is still not bad in the mouth. As for drinkablity...This beer is not a bad beer very cold and I could see the refreshing fator on a warm day. All around it is a odd but solid beer and I will buy again.","oddfire","Apr 15, 2009"

3.2,12.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Pink colored beer with a light pink fluffy head that fades quick and leaves some splotchy lace on the glass. Smells of toasted malt and beets otherwise very clean. Tastes very light and crisp, faint caramel malt and toasted grain with a splash of beet thrown in for good measure. Light and effervescent with a dry finish. Not bad but not great either. The bottle I have says 4.5% ABV.","biggred1","Apr 11, 2009"

3.08,8.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D - Why bother, it just tastes like a light lager and looks fruity but doesn't taste like any fruit was used in it. I could say it is drinkable, but only passable really. I would prefer some taste, not just texture and a colored pale beer. Whatever was used to color must have fermented out and I would say try as a lawnmower ale if you see it cheaply priced. the fuschia color is kind of queer(wacko)","Slatetank","Apr 03, 2009"
3.33,16.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Notes: Not much here, really. Light and somewhat refreshing, but dry. Tastes an awful lot like Single Chair with a light suggestion of red fruit.","SFLpunk","Mar 14, 2009"

3.63,27.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not a bad beer. Would probably quench your thirst in the summertime. Not much else to write about and too similar to Kerouac, except that the carbonation level seems higher. Otherwise, worth a sample if not a full growler.","Brad007","Beers"
3.44,20.7,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Off the tap at the brewery this beer (a re-branded, 'slightly tweaked version' of their Kerouac, a beer made with beets!) was a wine-cooler-pink color. The one-finger, baby-pink colored head did not retain well and left weak lacing consequently. The aroma was rather faint, a blend of pale malt, floral hops and sugar-beets. The flavors started dry with pale malt and some wheat-like notes followed by a bit of sweetness from the beets and hops. The finish was semi-bitter, the beets again, with a touch of herbal hops. Generally acidic with hints of tartness, like an augmented Hefeweizen. The mouthfeel was a bit foamy but soft, the carbonation average and the body medium/light. An unusual beer to be certain, but a summery one and worth a try if nothing else for the novelty.","thekevlarkid","0"
