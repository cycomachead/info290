It falters even more on the palate, where the hops mostly show up as a clean bitterness. The malt becomes more toasty than it promised at first. They do get some things right, it's definitely a clean beer and nothing becomes annoying or cloying, but there is just a lack of complexity that ultimately dooms it to also-ran status. It's really only about toasty malt and lingering bitterness in the finish, and that gets too monotonous by the end of the bottle.","TongoRad","Jun 03, 2014"

The only reason I can distinguish between this brew and, say, a French horn, besides the clear sonic advantage favoring the latter, is the stiff quaff of white foam before me. Once this is dissipated, a steady stream of bubbly goodness rises from the base. A deep sniff makes me question why I even continue sampling the pilsners and AALs of the world, as they all seem to smell the same to me: some corn syrup, some toasted rice, and a bit of wheat. Nothing offensive, nothing impressive. The tastes are also very similar (though the pilses are indeed distinguishable from the AALs), with a firm backbone of wheaty rice propping up a vaguely bitter body. What makes me less derisive toward this particular brew is the lack of a sharp tinniness that tends to pervade other pilsners. Still nothing Earth-shattering, but definitely not as negative as the rest of its ilk. Though that bubbly jet stream continues to rise like one of those bubble walls we all used to marvel at while visited Sharper Image as children, the carbonation is not overtly active, not overly fizzy, allowing the fairly light body glide sleekly over the tongue and down the gullet. Though it has not converted me into a smiling clear lager drinker, it has shown me that I oughtn't necessarily judge every one as boring before I try it, and that Croatia is coming along in terms of beer production.","TMoney2591","Beers"

3.36,10.5,4,3,3,3,4.5,"Pours light golden straw with perfect clarity. A fizzy three-finger head slowly gives way to a rocky soap bubble cap that holds fairly well and leaves some spotty lacing. Pilsener malt and some toasty biscuit aromas, background noble hops and a faint fruit scent. The Pilsener malt flavor is sweet at first, with subtle layers of toasted nut and light caramel flavors. This gives way to the more typical sharp pils taste. A very mild Saaz or tettnanger flavor and lacking bitterness are found in the aftertaste-but at least its not skunked. Lighter body with some decoction-esque malty texture and medium light carbonation make a slightly crisp and mellow mouthfeel. Finishes with traces of spicy german hops and a kiss of toasted Pils sweetness. Honestly, I found this to be an enjoyable beer -albiet lackluster example of the style. I bought it for the novelty of being Croastian beer- but I would be disappointed if I were expecting an authentic Czech PIls. On the other hand- its very affordable, highly drinkable, and could easily be passed off as a really great Macro. An ideal choice for introducing craft beer to non-enthusiasts.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 11, 2007"
