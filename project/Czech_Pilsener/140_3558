The Czech pils style, like other light lager styles, showcases subtleties in the malts and hops and this brew does just that. You're not browbeaten with hops but the beer isn't thin and bland like macro lagers. This is an extremely well-crafted summer beer which is refreshing and flavorful. The perfect beer for grilling. Would highly recommend, especially for fans of Czech and German pils.","Beric","May 26, 2014"

Light bodied with an above average carbonation level. The flavor profile is nice, but not complex. Against a very light biscuit background sweetness, the Saaz hop is noticeable but muted. The finish is clean and crisp with a nice effervescence that flows into a slight bitterness that lingers.

3.78,3.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 4/4/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, cracker, bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pilsner style. All around well balanced flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

I've had this beer on draft as well, and being that I am not a fan of lagers, I was also not a fan of this beer in any of its forms. I find that the taste is too bitter, as if licking a mahogany wood post. I just can't grasp the bitterness and wish that there was more to offer in terms of its flavor.","UltramagnusX","Jun 01, 2013"

The flavor follows the nose with regards to cereal like quality. The finish is slightly sweet with a balanced bitter finish. A nicely balanced lager on the palate and a light body characteristic to lagers. Being the third year I've had this beer in a row, I feel as though this year's batch is a little more bitter than before, but the balance is there, it lacks complexity. A fine lager nonetheless.","BeerAficionadoMCMXC","May 18, 2013"

3.88,6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured this into a tall pilsner glass – it’s a very clear gold with a very white head that settles down into a cap over a couple minutes. Carbonation is relatively sedate. Nose contains the usual suspects - faint lemon, honey, grass. For a pilsner the nose isn’t so spicy. The taste is great – floral and crisp and it has a nice bitter-sweet balance like any good summertime lager. Very crisp and leaves me wanting another sip. Given the right setting (hangin out on the roof with some friends and lawn chairs on a sunny day for instance) this beer would be absolutely perfect.","NardiByNature","Jul 29, 2012"

This beer does not make the common seasonal mistake of overpowering the drinker with gimmicky flavors. Overall it is a light and refreshing brew, that has good carbonation and is extremely smooth and drinkable. This is a great summer beer that you can drink during your BBQ or on your pool deck and not get sick of it. In a marketplace full of crappy breweries looking to make a buck during the summer, Sierra Nevada comes through with an offering that is different, refreshing and never lets you forget that you are drinking a "beer."","davecavemaster","Jul 16, 2012"

Light lemony/citrusy taste that was decently balanced with the hops. Nice beer for the summer, I definitely like it a little bit better then the Sam's Summer Ale. I wouldn't pay a lot at a bar for this beer, but it's decent to pick up for it's price. Not something I'd drink everyday, but maybe occasionally during the summers.","jaasen64","Jun 01, 2012"

3.46,-5.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought that this was a decent beer and a slightly above average example of the style, it had some good Pilsener like qualities but I could have gone without the lemon zest but I could see why that flavor would be in their summer beer. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, and was crisp and refreshing, but it's a little to bitter for me to want to drink more then two in a row. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both very true to style and pretty well done. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, the skunky aroma just seemed out of place and wasn't needed. This would be the kind of beer that I would order in a restaurant because it seems like it would go good with food, but it isn't something that I would need to buy another six pack of, but good when I want a crisp and refreshing brew, I recommend giving it a shot but the lemon zest might not be for everyone and I wasn't that thrilled about it. As far as Sierra Nevada beers go I would say that this one falls in the middle of the pack, not a bad beer by any means, but not that interesting even though it has some additional nontraditional flavors to it. In the end I think I prefer the more traditional Czech Pilsener's, but I am glad I gave this beer a shot, this was pretty different from the Pale Wheat Ales that most brewery's market as their Summer beer, keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","May 06, 2012"

Or better yet, what most American's would want from their beers if *THEY* actually cared and the Pilsener style really was the beer of choice.

The taste is crisp with the bready malt and citrus and grass of the malt taking equal share of the flavor. There was no discernible metallic notes like on euro pilsners or lagers. The mouthfeel was nicely carbonated and light as to be expected from a pilsner. Over all this seasonal is a very drinkable beer. While it isn't outstanding...

3.75,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"2011 Summerfest. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass, the beer is an insanely light, pale, bright yellow coloring that is slightly hazed, and the beer doesn't have a lick of head whatsoever. The nose is toasty, with some citrus and honey highlights. The beer's flavors are toasty, with lemon zest highlights and a very light spicing of clove. Decent flavors riding a light, crisp body. The aftertaste is more of the citrus and spice, with an effervescent feel to it. The beer has a clean, crisp finish. Great, light beer for hot days, with decent flavors compared to most of the style.","GarthDanielson","Dec 11, 2011"

I'm just not used to hunting for the subtle flavors that are characteristic of this type of style. I love bold flavors, so these subtle flavors kid of throw me off. I'm sure, according to stylistic standard, this is a great pilsner. However, according to my standards, I'm not really impressed. If you like lighter beers, you will enjoy this.

3.85,5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: My first SN beer and I am quite surprised at how modestly hopped this beer is. This doesn't fit my imagination of what West Coast beer is (but then again Anchor Steam surprised me too.). I guess my first reaction is disappointment, expecting more with bolder hoppiness. However I next am in awe of the sheer drinkability and balance of this beer. Not as bold as Troegs or Brooklyn, this beer is utterly and seductively sessionable. At 5% abv this is a beer that one could down bottle after bottle on a Summer day and all through the evening. What a pleasure to drink.","fx20736","Aug 14, 2011"

3.7,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O - I like the beer, and think it has refreshing summer beer qualities, but I find the dry bitterness in the finish to offset those thirst quenching properties.

Taste is malty with a quick response of bitter hops. A bit of lemon and spice on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is good with plenty of carbonation for the style. Finish is medium dry with a lingering bitterness. Overall a nice West Coast take on a classic Pilsener. Very drinkable in the warmer weather. Good job SN!","Spikester","Aug 06, 2011"
4.08,11.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: A very solid summer lager from Sierra Nevada. It carries some of the trademark Sierra Nevada aggressive hopping, but like all their beer, it works. It's never overbearing and super refreshing. Lawnmower beer for sure.","Goblinmunkey7","Aug 05, 2011"
3.97,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O-Overall this is very good beer. This is a beer i could drink multiples of, not to filling. Very smooth. Sort of leaves me wanting another one.

3,-18,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured a 2" white head. Clear pale lemon yellow color. Really not much of a smell at all at first and as it warmed all I got was grass. Fairly standard BMC taste. In fact I don't even detect any of those common attributes of spice or citrus so often worked into summer brews, this really is just typical BMC. Crisp finish but not a standout. I expected more from Sierra Nevada.","MoreThanWine","Aug 02, 2011"

3.63,-0.8,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"Overall: This is the first lager I've ever tried from Sierra Nevada, but it's not really thrilling me as much as their classic ale recipes.

3.86,5.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is what an American macro brew should taste like. Would I accept one if offered on a hot summer day? Gladly.

No, I would not.","hrmhrm","Jul 23, 2011"

4.23,15.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4," The flavor is smooth and malty up front, but mid-taste the flavor of the herbal hop emerges with some nice gentle grassy and tea like flavor, somewhat floral but not too much to be enjoyable with some citrus elements. The taste of the malt is gentle and slightly sweet with a mild yeast that adds some character to the brew and perhaps a tinge of mineral. The overall impression I get from this is it is a great beer, an all around flavorful and quaffable lager which is saying something because there aren't enough of its ilk out there these days.","Slatetank","Jul 20, 2011"

4.02,9.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer is pale golden and crystal clear with a soapy white head. It smells of lemony/ grassy hops with grains and salt. It tastes bitter with the same lemon and grassy hops a smotth pilsner malt flavor washes over and there is a bitter finish. The beer is light and crisp with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. Excellent summer beer, excellent pilsner all around.","JMad","Jul 18, 2011"

3.76,2.7,4,3,4,4,4,"I'm an ale drinker -- lagers are not my style. That said I feel compelled to sample different lager/pilsners every summer. SummerFest is a must sample for me (as Sierra Nevada is my favorite brewery). The beer has a slightly deeper color than most lagers/pilsners and a reasonable amount of head for the style. I pick up grassy like aromas and hops in the scent. It’s a smooth beer with more pilsner characteristics than lager. It’s very smooth and very little aftertaste. Again, it’s not my style, but one of the better products in its class.","mikechance","Jul 15, 2011"
3.85,5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: They've made a consistent, highly drinkable pils for the right time of year. Sure, it's not breaking ground, but what it does, it does well.

3.59,-1.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a crystal clear yellow with a thin head that didn't stick around. Floral hops and definite note of honey on the nose, not fancy artisanal wildflower honey, honey from the plastic bear. Nice hop bitterness and flavor that I associate with Saaz hops, clean finish and nicely carbonated. This is a beer that I wasn't crazy about on the first sip but as it warmed a bit and I got to the end of the glass, I liked it more and more. Not the best summer seasonal on the planet, but especially if you are at a regular supermarket, you could do a lot worse than to pick up a six pack of this beer.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 10, 2011"
4.18,14.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager has a very thick, egg shell-colored head, and a hazy, yellow appearance with lots of bubbles and fine particulate matter floating about. The aroma is faint, but some slight breadiness is picked up. Taste is, at first, white bread, but hops explode in the mouth at the mid sip. It’s hard to distinguish the various hop varieties here, but the smooth bitterness is delicious. Mouthfeel is light, and Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager finishes crisp, refreshing, and semi-dry. I really liked it. RJT","RonaldTheriot","Jul 10, 2011"

3.82,4.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Clear, golden yellow with only a ring of tiny bubbles around the edges. Aroma contains lemon and grassy hops with a light freshly ground grain body. Flavor is crisp upfront with a strong carbonation tingle all the way to the finish. Hop character is dominant throughout. Sweet lemon upfront transitioning to grassy and finishing very dry and crisp. Malts are balanced and provide a solid sweetness to back the bold hop character. Overall a solid and bigger than expected malt body with a large hop character, for a lager. Big hop flavor for a crisp beer on a hot day.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 09, 2011"
4.2,14.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This summer lager pours a clear golden color topped by a thcik bright-white head that holds well and leaves a bit of lace. The aroma is both hoppy and malty, spicy and citrusy hops with some cracker like malts, very nice. The flavor is much the nose, soft, bready malt balanced by moderate hop bitterness and moderate spicy hop flavor. The beer finishes nicely balanced and just dry enough to make you want more immediately. The carbonation is moderate and body medium. Overall a very well crafted, one of the best summer offerings IMO.","uwmgdman","Jul 08, 2011"

Definitely a good one here. Mouthfeel is as advertised: crisp, clean, refreshing. Sierra Nevada almost never disappoints, and this is a highly recommended pilsener.

It almost gives off that creamy Samuel Adams Boston Lager type body which I think a lot of Pilsners are missing. This long lagering period that they speak of is really the highlight of this beer when compared to the other amazing Pilsners like Noble Pils and Prima Pils.

There really wasn't a whole lot of hops in this from what I could get from it. The Color was a light yellow and very clean looking. Thin head.

Don't get it twisted, this is a good beer, but it loses for me on the terms of being a summer selection. Few breweries master the summer seasonal, as it seems that most just offer a watered down selection of their flagship brew - and Sierra Nevada nearly falls into that category. It falls short in taste while simultaneously lacking in the "refreshment" category, and that for me is a big no-no. If you sacrifice one, you better compensate in the other.

The aroma was full of spicy and lemony hops, mild malt, and some corn sweetness. Moderate bitterness and fruity sweetness up front.

The smell is largely of bready malts, with a hint of spiciness from the Saaz in the background. Summerfest tries to walk the line between lightly hopped and under hopped, and just misses the mark for me. The nose hinted at it, but a few sips confirm that this beer is a little bit lacking in the hops department. Yes it's supposed to be subtle and an easy drinking summer brew, but I'm not asking for a hop bomb here, I'm just asking that I not have to strain to notice the spicey Saaz flavor. It's a shame too, because this beer is incredibly drinkable, not too carbonated and not too heavy, I found it disappearing from my glass rather quickly. If Summerfest had a little more hop presence it might be one of my go to summer beers, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again as is.","axeman9182","May 19, 2010"

To be honest, this reminds me of what a good, every day American beer should be like. Unfortunately, here in PA (with tax), it costs $36 a case. So, not the best choice for an "every day" beer. Color is a lovely golden hue. Nice head on it, although not nearly as thick as their standard pale ale. Smelll is light, crisp, sharp. Taste is a very good balance of hops and malt. Really smooth. Grainy is a good word to use to describe the taste. Mouthfeel is fine, just right. This is an almost perfect beer for those warm-weather days.

I do like the beer's finish and it does leave you wanting more, the malt is just slightly sweet and finishes clean. Stylistically the beer misses the mark a bit for a claim as a Bohemian Pils, but it does deliver as a good easy drinking summer beer. I guess it all depends on what the main goal of this beer was, if it was to nail a Bohemian Pilsner style or be a mass market craft beer perfect for summer events. I would put my money on the latter.

I'm not going to like this one. The taste really caught me off guard though. It was a really nice citrus flavor, with quite a lot more hoppiness than I expected from a lighter beer.

Prepared more as a summer special brew, the light body and underweight taste and mouthfeel make for decent quaffing but is perhaps a bit lithe for my taste. I have had this brew over the last three seasons and must say that I seem to dislike it more as time goes on. The 2007 "vintage" was the most un-enjoyable while the 2006 was the most satisfying thus placing the 2008 in between. Effusing wallpaper paste like nose from the light malts unfortunately reminds me of some of the abysmal beers from Saranac, but nevertheless this is many notches better than that.

The taste is light, moderate to low carbonation, very crisp, peppery, a tad bit of tangyness, some lemon hints as well. The peppery tang is a bit of a turn off and lasts too far into the finish.

But the flavor is quite good - malty and tongue-grabbing, with a pleasant little whiff of noble hops and a satisfying cereal finish. Mouthfeel is good, though not as all encompassing as smaller rivals like Victory's Prima Pils or Troegs Sunshine Pils.

Taste is good, a bit of stray/grass as expected from this style and then at the end a slight bitterness from those good ol' SN hops. Again, very light touch but good.

The bitterness sticks around, but it's astringent and not pleasant like the bitterness that comes from Sierra Nevada's Ales.

The brew poured to a somewhat deep golden color with some amber like highlights. Fair sized white head that has nice retention leaving good retention. The aroma is a nice mix of malt (sweet, slight grass like, fresh feel) and Hops (spice like feel in the nose when taking a deep smell). The flavors are nice, again malt comes to mind first but not as sweet as the nose would lead you to believe. The malt flavor quickly breaks to the hop which dominates the back half but not in an over powering way, saaz is clear in the flavor. Has a medium dry finish. Overall I like this brew, nice character, satisfying although not overly rememberable. I would get this again, but it will not stick in my mind to run out and get again.","Stimack","May 14, 2008"

It lacks, though, the decoction-built malt body that would put in the same league as the czech lagers. This is a solid effort, and certainly worthy of lawnmower-class refreshment. This is what the big three (or is it two, now?) would be making if they had respect for their customers.

2.55,-30.3,3,3,2,3.5,2.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear golden-yellow color, with a thin bubbly head. The smell is rather non-distinct like most pilsners, but there is hints of pale malts and a slight hoppiness to it. The taste is rather bitter, only a slight graininess otherwise, could be much better balanced and overall not that enjoyable. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a bubbly carbonation comprised of many fine bubbles. Drinkability suffers due to the fact that this beer just doesn't taste very good. All around "average" describes this beer at best.","gmfessen","Sep 08, 2007"

No hop aroma at all. Taste is true to style, but rather lacking. Again, fruitiness noted and grassy herabal hops in the background.

Smell gives a hint of hoppiness but nothing outstanding. Tastes like a good lager, done California style. Flavor is hoppy ( not as hoppy as SNPA but still a nice little bite). There is a spiciness (pepper?) here as well and just a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel is a hair thin, but that is probably right for a summer beer. The hops flavor takes care of the mouthfeel after the first one, coating the tongue with hoppy goodness. Drinkability is excellent!!! This is not a beer to slowly savor, it is a session beer best served in mass quantities (pitchers) on a hot day with good company. A nice beer.","JayQue","Aug 16, 2007"

The mouthfell is nice and light with moderate carbonatoin that support the crisp bitterness from the hops. Truly a great summer beer, very refreshing, very drinkable.

I get some pear and apple. The saaz hops then come in and tear it up with big spice, herbs, grass, and hay. Finishes dry with a solid bitterness some honey that stays on the palate.

Sharp hop bite is the first impression on the palate, with a light scrubbing carbonation on the tongue. Dry, biscuity, bready malt qualities are very ably balanced by the hops. Notes of golden pear and grape skin, and light honey are all punctuated by the hops, which themselves add a gentle floral touch to the aromatic qualities. Dry overall, but fairly juicy and creamy on the tongue, really goes a long way for such a light-bodied beer. Truly exceptional drinkability. For years this was the one Sierra Nevada seasonal I had trouble selling-through, and I always felt it a shame as it's so well-done, and is probably my favorite Sierra Nevada offering.

The mouthfeel is pretty heavy for a pilsner, I'll give it that however and I could drink these all day. Whats funny is I quafed all these down on all cloudy days...but a damn good beach beer!

First sip is very crisp, dryly malty; floral hops make a huge appearance here, too, with a prominent bitterness. Body is rather thin, and the alcohol kind of shines through, surprisingly.

I can't say that this is my Pilsner, because I haven't had that many, I will definitely try some more before I come back to this one.

Again, there is nothing wrong with this beer, I just need more excitement from a seasonal brew. I will stick to the summer wits.","ALESwhatCURESya","Aug 18, 2005"

This is a tough beer. There are not a lot of flavors that jump out at you but rather begin to blend to form a very well balanced fuller bodied beer. It's a APA lover's summer brew.

Slight souring on the side of lemons. Body is better than most lagers, adds creaminess, and better coats the mouth. Finishes clean and powdery. Leaving subtle bittering.

3.66,0,4,3,4,3,4,"The smell was nice and crisp, hop and malt pretty equally balanced and a bit of a light grassy note as well. The taste was pretty complex for a pilsner, many echoes of fruit and a rather sweet note with a very light hop finish. It was light on the tongue, leaving a clean palate for the next drink though as a pilsner I would have expected a bit more fine carbonation leaving a bit of tingle on the tongue to go with a nice hop finish - here it's quite a bit more muted. Pilsner or what, this is a very tasty brew and it's a good light beer for summertime sipping...","RedwoodGeorge","Jul 13, 2004"

Taste is grain and a little sweet malt at first, followed by grassy, maybe a bit piney hops. Crisp, refreshing finish with very good balance. Medium to light mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Very, very drinkable... this is a beer for drinking in large gulps on a very hot day!","jimdkc","Jul 08, 2004"
4.03,10.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"There's a real nice balance between hops and malt in the nose, but not too aggressive on either front. That impression continues to the palate. An initial burst of sweetness gives way to more dominant malty characteristics, almost grainy, but certainly not in a bad way- almost like a German Pils. The finish is dry and lingering. This beer definitely benefits from a vigorous pour as its aroma is its best quality. It has a nice balance about it as well, though I would wish for a touch more personality.","TongoRad","Jul 08, 2004"

It pours a clear, light, golden color with small bubbles and a thin white head that fades to a mere coating on the surface of the beer. Smell is bready and with a hint of spicey hops. Taste is very light, with some wheat flavors and a slightly tart and dry finish with a very small hop bite. Mouthfeel is also light making this an extremely refreshing and incredibly drinkable beer. A very well-crafted lawnmower beer.","ColForbin","Jul 06, 2004"

When I did start pouring into the pint though, there was no trouble. Tons of carbination rising throught the golden lager leading up to a small amount of tiny bubbles at the top where it stayed as mostly a light, white layer. Scents of hay, fresh and light. Very balanced. Crisp tasting, medium bodied with alot of carbination that holds well throughout. The finish is dry and leaves a very nice bitterness with you. Good drinkability. I am usually not one for lagers but will drink them if they are there- just not my first choice. But this one is nice.","shapudding","Jul 04, 2004"

Hop aromas hit the nose with some slight malts left in the background for good measure. Some grassy aroma can also be detected. Spicy hops hit the palate first and then combine with some malts towards the end. Some grainy flavors are in the aftertaste along with those spicy hops that seem to last forever. It's not over the top but it sure does last a while. Overall this isn't a bad choice for a summer cookout. Goes down easy, that's for sure.","necoadam","Jul 02, 2004"
3.6,-1.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a sparkling clear yellow-golden in color with not a bit of head. Miniscule white head does a nice attempt at lacing the glass, but with token success. Aromas are quite clean brisk. Hoppy, but not overly so. There is a hint of malts there as well. Flavor is more of the same. An interesting mix of hops and that "lager" flavor. Not quite macro, but more mainstream than I'd expected. Maybe that's why it was so popular with the crowd at CAH. Brisk and snappy flavor, starting with a mildly bitter front, fleeting sweetness in the middle, and dry/acidic on the tail end. Moderate carbonation and decent mouthfeel. A good beer for the summer, no doubt, but I think I'll stick to my hefe's to quench the Richmond heat.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jul 02, 2004"

The beer pours a dark/yellow with a white head that is very impressive, lacing is also great. The smell is rather clean with grain upfront, other than traces of floral it is very clean to the nose. The taste is excellent, light bodied, refreshing and crisp. Floral hops are the first thing you notice in the taste, some sweetness from the malts, slight melon tastes as well. A perfect summer beer.

Still, enough of the elements poke their head through the clouds that the palate note an occasional poignancy, and those distinctions are real positives. It's light, and very refreshing, and that along with the flavor pretty much defines drinkable. In spite of some minor palatal ennui, I'm looking forward to drinking the four I have left.

Light bodied, but not watery and the carbonation level was where it should be for this style. Overall, not bad. Lagers like this typicall do not appeal to me, but this could be a good thirst quencher. It was pretty crisp and clean, with a nice balance. I would probably be willing to have another one.

4.57,24.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"A very credible lager coming from the aleheads at SN. Pale gold, crystal-clear with wispy, lacey head. Gentle aroma of musty yeasts and flowery hops. Malts are light, sweet and bolstered by big hop quality that lets you know this beer was brewed on the left coast! Otherwise a note-perfect European lager that goes down easy, refreshes the palate, quenches the thirst. The tempered but defiant hop kick is flowery, sweet, and really creates a summer feeling. Drinkability is beyond the pale. This is a unique beer and an excellent one. It's one of the best summer seasonals I can think of, and I enjoy it more than the overplayed currently-shadow-of-its-former-self SN Pale Ale. This beer should be a no-brainer for a BBQ, it's light enough for daytime drinking and should stand up to spicy meats and sauces. Furthermore, everyone will be pleased with it; the more adventurous drinkers have some toothsome hops to wrap their tastebuds around, while the quivering timid masses have a light, pale, cleansing lager that is very non-threatening. Pour it into a tall pilsner glass with a huge head.","Thrasher","Jul 13, 2003"

Draft beer poured golden-light with puddles of thin foam, esp. around the edges of the glass. Somewhat fragrant smell of hops. Taste was quite tart and hoppy, but I would have liked this one better with balancing malt profile. I never had this beer before but am familiar with their pale ale and use of hops, so I was rather expecting a fair amount, but overall the taste did not hit me right (this time).

The smell is surprisingly nice for a summer lager: floral hops and a very nice hop smell that has undercurrents of bread/biscuit. The malt smell is more than backed up by the flavor and the hops lend a slight bite while contributing a nice tropical flower taste. Drinkability?

It poured a clear golden color with a nice white head that lasted awhile, leaving a decent lace down till the end. The malty characteristics really stood out in the smell, with some grassy and hoppy smells as well. The taste was a great summer balance between malt and hops, with the malt being the dominant flavor. As the beer warms a bit, the hops come through a bit more, and it tasted more balanced.

It pours clear golden with no head at all. The hop character is the one redeeming quality. It's slightly spicy with a citrusy aroma and taste similar to their pale ale.

The malt character of the beer is pretty high, and thus the full malty finish is its defining characteristic. Mild citrus flavors are also detectable. Mouthfeel is carbonated and bubbly, but does not detract from the drinkability. Worth a try, and I can see myself drinking more of this when the weather gets hot.","IrishRedRock","May 02, 2003"

It is pale and somewhat carbonated and has little to offer in the smell department other than hops and some sweet smells. The taste is hoppy but there are malt hints as well. Not nearly as hoppy as I have come to expect from SN, maybe due to the style. It is drinkable. Its not that it is a bad beer, just that I have come expect alot from the brewery.","doho95fu","May 02, 2003"

Herbal hops and some cereal-tasting grain are also present as well as just a slight citrusy twist on the finish. Not overly complex, but it shouldn't be.

Nice aroma of malt and hops with some fruitiness and a bright lemony note that I assume comes from citrusy hops. The body is medium-light with a very fine & slightly effervescent carbonation, making it very silky in the mouth. The flavor is lightly hoppy and citrusy up-front, warming into a lightly sweet maltiness as it crosses the palate, and drying out just before the swallow with some more light hop flavor and bitterness. All of these flavors are carried over, to some extent, into the aftertaste. A really refreshing and interesting change of pace that really does make a great summer beer.

Subtle aromas in the nose, some hop aroma that's a bit plant-like and citrus-like. Hop bitterness plays a big role in the flavor, with grain right behind it. Once again, a bit plant-like with citrus. Smoothness in the mouthfeel is interrupted by the hops. I didn't find this as refreshingly satisfying as this type of lager should be. Hops take over where they shouldn't.
