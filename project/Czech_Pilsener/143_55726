Light, crisp beer has a good taste, hops were noticeable but not very strong, taste was good and had character compared to other shiner offerings. Nice light offering, and would definitely order again.","dukeandduke","Feb 07, 2015"
2.99,-14.1,3,2.75,3,3.5,3,"Crystal clear golden in color. Minimal head dissapating quickly and minimal lacing. Aroma is very light with malt, toast and a touch of citrus coming through. Taste is very light with bready and earthiness being the dominant flavors. Carbonation is nice and mouthfeel is good. This beer, being a pilsner, is still lacking the flavor and balance that I would have expected.......","hophugger","Feb 03, 2015"

The malty sweetness is prominent on the tongue. There is some mild citrus hop notes, but the hop bitterness is almost entirely in the finish, more than fine for the non-hop-heads among us. Not especially carbonated either, but sessionable and highly drinkable. Mildly recommended, although for the price I think I'd grab the more hop-forward Noble Pils from Sam Adams or the Summer Pils from one of Texas' other great breweries, St. Arnold's.","makersmarkers","May 16, 2013"

Into a brandy glass this reveals a clear and yellow golden color under a blotchy thin head with a good lacing. Aroma is a light but bright one with the classic pilsener malt nose and those sharp metallic and hop notes. A sweet and bright, generously bodied malt feel quenches over the palate with an equally crisp and refreshing finish. It truly is "simple and refined" as the brewer states. A simple and refined display of Saaz hops. Prosit!","albertjr21","Feb 07, 2011"

A bread fragrance comes in at first scent that is followed by a light grassy fragrance, finishing with a mild cabbage scent. Bread and biscuit dominate the taste right at the beginning, then it blends itself to the hop bitterness. The bitterness brings grassy and mild citrus flavors , that stay on the palate long after each taste is gone. A watery feel at the front with the cleansing sensation of carbonation coming through midway. The finish is dry and the palate is left with a strong, lingering arid feel.

Fruity, somewhat light floral hops with an undercurrent of biscuity malt in the nose.

While, not deviated far from your typical macro lager - it deviates with much more mouthfeel, which provides a nice creaminess. A bit, more flavor, and good drinkability.","HoustonTX","Jan 28, 2010"
3.5,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours golden yellow with a white head. The beer is very clear. The aroma is wheat, malt and some grassy hops. I also get a slight butteryness. The flavor is similar with a nice touch of bitterness from the grassy hops. The butter is there as well, taking away from the overall flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An unremarkable beer, but one of the better ones from Shiner.","Mora2000","Beers"
3.85,10.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Just picked this up at the local HEB plus off Anderson Mill. Pours with a golden color with a fluffy head. Completely transparent in body. Smells like every czech pilsner I have had, reminds me exactly of Pilsner Urquell. I enjoy the bitterness czech pilsners usually have. This beer was no different, and even had less of a bite than I thought it would. This was smooth from start to finish, I definitely enjoyed this beer.","fjordhook","0"
