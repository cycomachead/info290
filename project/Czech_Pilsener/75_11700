A roasted butterscotch also in the mix. Like most mexican beers, a doughy yeast comes on strong after swirling. Medium-light sweet, medium-light bitter, medium-light sour taste. Lot’s of vanilla maltose, however its not overpowering. A sprinkle of nuttiness and a bit of pizza dough mouthfeel. Quenchable to the thirst.","stoutman","Mar 09, 2012"

Corn, maybe a bit of malt. Don't really smell any hops though. You can taste the malt and there are a few actual hops you can taste. Decent carbonation, but still a bit watery like all the rest of the beers in Mexico. Not horrible, but still barely decent. Fortunately I only have about three more I think to review and two of them are at least decent.","GClarkage","Nov 04, 2003"
