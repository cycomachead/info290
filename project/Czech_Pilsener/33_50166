Soft, supple and firm hops, lemony and mildly earthy work very well with a clean, honey and bready malt character. Medium light in body with soft malty fullness, this beer is clean, crispy carbonation. Long bready finish with some hop bitterness And excellent lemony hop flavor. Wonderful pillowy palate. Highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Oct 18, 2014"

A fairly basic smell, but a little better than average. Tipping it back and I taste malts, some hops, quite a bit of bread. The mouthfeel here is great, very low-key and crisp. It has perfect carbonation and finishes very clean. Over the years, I grab a bomber from these guys once in a blue moon. And this was a good choice and it went very well with the spicy food that I had for dinner alongside it.","mltobin","Oct 01, 2012"

Taste is sweet honey and malts with some grass notes. Crisp with a nice mouthfeel from the cask. Very drinkable. Most Pilseners are a bit boring to me but this one does have some nice complex flavors. Overall, glad I got to try it on cask.

3.32,-15.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, pale, yellow gold coloring with a thin, dense, foamy white head. Floral nose, both effervescent and slightly tangy, with a touch of buttery sweetness in the background. Flavors are light, with a roastiness that comes in strong around the mid-palate. Buttery and toasted grain backbone with some slight sour notes throughout, all of which overpowers the floral flavors trying to break through. Roasty aftertaste on a light, round body. The carbonation fights to make it crisp, but falls just short. Sparse lacing left along the glass as you drink. The beer has a roasty and smooth finish. Easy enough to drink.","GarthDanielson","Jun 11, 2012"

4.04,3.1,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"The beer pours a deep gold hazy color with some very nice lacing left on the glass with a nice ring of head, looks very nice. The smell is hardly there, but I do get the twist of Saaz hops and some nice wheaty bready and certainly grainy malts, a clean overall smell just not very strong. The taste is very well balanced and goes clean over the palate with nice fruity notes and excellent tasty semi sweet malts and fresh grains, and a lemon twist of hops and maybe a little bit of dates at the end, though its abruptly cut off with a dry finish. A classic clean and sudsy feel, pretty nice overall and easy to drink. A nice beer I'd get again, great to have while watching football!","Dreadnaught33","Sep 08, 2011"

3.4,-13.3,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a 2.5" white head. Hazy straw yellow color. The flavor profile is typical BMC all the way too me, just a little stronger and smoother, and I kind of wonder if that isn't more to the credit of it being a fresher and constantly refrigerated version of a pilsner.

3.92,0,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: A nice, balanced pilsener with an authentic Czech feel to it.

4.13,5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best by 01/04/2011 indicated on the bottle. Pours a translucent orange gold with copious tiny bubbles effervescing from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap. Head is one inch, bright white and latte-like. Nose is citrusy with grains and a kiss of Saaz hops. Taste consistent with nose - cereal grains are expressed and there is also a touch of sweetness in the mix. Finishes with a combination of lemony citrus and a mild hops bittering. Mouthfeel is light bodied and lively with a crisp finish. An extremely pleasant and drinkable Czech Pilsener. Having had both the bottle and draft version, I have to say that I found the bottle to be the more preferable of the two.","Jwale73","Sep 06, 2010"

Flavor is good, though I'm a sucker for this style. Very good balance between malt and hops, this comes off as fresh and bright, with a short, crisp finish. Super nice flavor here. Not as grassy as many Czech pils, but the balance and profile is superb. A lot of people will pass this one over as it's not super exciting, but it's quite well crafted.","JAXSON","Aug 18, 2010"

4.36,11.2,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The aroma has hints of the grassy, spicy hops and just a slight hint of the sweet malt. Upon first sip, you're hit with those hops. As it lingers in your mouth, you get the nice sweeter malt flavors. It's really hard to describe their flavor as they don't hang around too long before the flavor turns back to the hops and leaves a nice dryness. It's really hard to stop drinking this one. The carbonation in this beer, though relatively effervescent in the glass, is more mild in the mouth, though you can feel it tingle a bit on your tongue. It helps this beer go down easy, keeping it refreshing. While it may not be huge in-your-face flavor, it's just the perfect amount of flavor with a nice dry finish. This is exactly the kind of beer needed on such a beautiful day. I see myself buying more of this beer in the future. It's another excellent beer from a great brewery.","RunawayJim","Jul 28, 2010"
4,2,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Plenty drinkable. Low ABV helps for sure, but it's just good stuff. Drink it cold, drink it slow or suck em down. However you want to do this is a good pils. Tastes like a good pils should. If there were beers that could completely displace adjuncts given the exposure, stuff like this would do the job.","ElDavicho","Jul 20, 2010"

4.3,9.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"F: Finishes very clean and crisp, just as it should. A slight lingering sticky feel takes away from it a bit. Some lingering toasty malts and lager flavors, as well as that dry lager yeast like straw slight saison etc flavor is there just a tad. A slight bitterness in there too and the slightest memory of the noble hops, as well as a mild grassy hop taste. Mostly dry but that slight sticky sweetness sticks, perhaps the only flaw.","jlindros","Jul 14, 2010"

3.85,-1.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"As a regular fan of BBC brews, I was not surprised by the overall tone of their take on a German style: subtle where other American breweries are harsh; understated where others are hamhanded. A quickly-disappearing cottonball head let loose with waves of hops and oranges and a distinct cloud of malt sweetness. More of same in the taste, with some grassy flavors that rounded things out nicely. No overhopped sting at the end, no syrupy suffocation from the malt at the beginning. It could have been a wee bit drier in the finish, but that's a quibble. This was also slightly undercarbonated for my taste, but still hit the spot on a hot evening. Worth seeking out while it's available.","gfreed","Jun 30, 2009"
4.33,10.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear gold with a fluffy white cap. Good head retention, lots of sticky lacing clung to the glass. Very hoppy aroma, floral and slightly fruity, lemon zest, with a little bit of spiciness. Slight sulfur character as well. Hiding behind the hops is a delicate maltiness that's easy to miss at first. Bitterness was present throughout, balanced rather than being up front and bracing. I was expecting a little more of a bitterness kick from the hops, but it ended up working with this beer and there was certainly a lot of hop flavour jammed in here - floral for the most part, with a fruity and spicy finish. Clean maltiness provided a bit of sweetness. Dry and medium bodied, average carbonation, crisp. Quite good. Much better than most lagers being churned out by otherwise respectable craft breweries in the US (other than several in PA) and a solid pils. I enjoyed it and will be picking up a few more of these in the near future.","DrJay","Jun 21, 2009"
