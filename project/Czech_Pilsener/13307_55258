Grapefruit nose and flavor is grapefruit hops, hints of caramel. This isn't a lager or a pilsner, it tastes like an IPA even with the low ABV. Label is Dream Pils. Expensive at $6.49 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma.","jdhilt","Feb 16, 2012"

3.53,-9.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: This is a solid pale lager that will likely be welcomed by fans of hoppy lagers. While it is a unique and likable beer in its own right, Danish Dream is still a bit rough around the edges in the sense that the nose could use some more depth and the mouthfeel could stand to be smoother and more rounded. Still, this is a pretty decent little lager.","mrfrancis","Feb 02, 2012"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Definitely a unique take on the style. The hop and malt flavors and aromas are well balanced and play well off each other. Crisp and clean and very pleasant to drink. If the price tag wasn't what it was it'd be a nice beer to have a few of in one sitting.","ms11781","Aug 27, 2011"

4.77,21.7,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Had this one on tap on the Bethlehem Speakeasy on 12-11-2009. When I read that this was a Pilsner I rolled my eyes and said to myself "Oh great, another Pilsner". I went with a friend of mine and I ordered a different beer from this one and my friend desided he'd try this one. I'm so glad he got it and let me try it, I immediately bought myself my own glass of it. This beer poured out as a golden orange color, slightly hazy with a nice foamy looking white head. Upon settling the head left a wonderful lacing down the glass. It looked incredible for a pilsner! The smell of the beer was strong with hops, some nice malts and even a little touch of fruity aromas were coming off this thing. The taste of the beer was just as impressive as the aroma. Every sip was just as good as the one before it, if not better. The mouthfeel was very smooth and had a crisp sharp finish. Overall this beer is without a doubt my favorite Pilsner. I can't imagine having one that tops this. I would love to have this beer again one day.","Knapp85","Dec 05, 2010"

3.87,-1.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Good hoppy aroma. Murky golden coloured body with lots of white bubbly foam, that leaves levels of lace linings as it goes down. Average mouthfeel, a tad astringent. Very drinkable, god hoppy taste particularly for 4.6% a.b.v.Good bitterness, orange flavour. Above average carbonation.","Sammy","Sep 04, 2010"
3.95,0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a light copper color pilsner with a nice big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of crisp dry hops with light floral malt and subtle sweet undertones. Taste is quite dry with nice crisp dry hops finish with some light grassy floral notes with light sweet notes as well. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation. Very well brewed with nice hops presence though more grassy notes would have been even more beneficial.","Phyl21ca","Mar 16, 2010"
3.72,-5.1,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The smell was very positive, but the brew did not deliver as I had expected, might be better in a really warm surrounding. Tasted at a beer sampling at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden.","rarbring","Mar 15, 2010"
3.78,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Tap, City Beer Store. A fine beer but not terribly exciting. This beer looks, smells and tastes a lot like a dry IPA. It drinks a bit bigger than the abv would suggest. The beer has a nice aroma that leans toward American hops - grapefruit rind and pine notes. There's also a touch of grassiness and some yeast in the nose. The flavor is dry and yeasty with light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and quite good. It's a nice sessionable beer that costs a fairly outrageous price, at least this far from its home.","popery","Beers"

4.33,10.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"As it says in brackets up top this beer is called The American Dream on my bottle and have been looking forwards to trying it and gotta thank the boys at Cellarbrations Carlisle for again getting their hands on some new mikkeller brews as he has definately gotta be one of my favourite brewers who just continues to push the boundaries while still producing top quality beer anyways onto the beer,it pours a light copper/orange colour quite interesting for a pilsner with nice carbonation that leaves a frothy two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere very impressive looking,the aroma is very citrusy with passionfruit and tropical notes,it has a very easy light mouthfeel and just slides down so easy with beautiful tastes of tropical fruit and a passionfruity bitter finish but not overly bitter but in my eyes too bitter to be called a Pilsner let alone a Double Pilsner and would probaly lean towards calling it an American Pale Ale but netherless this beer is absolutely top quality no matter what style it comes under and right now im wishing i bought way more big thumbs up.","ADZA","Jan 15, 2010"
4.38,11.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"For me this is a great beer. At just 4.6% it isn't particularly strong but there is lots of flavour. My only criticism is that the bitterness is probably just a touch high and could do with being toned down.","dgilks","Jan 08, 2010"
4.25,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The nose is all hops, big pine pungency with some citrus and a good deal of bitterness. Malt character is practically non-existent. The palate opens with a big, biting bitterness with pine and a little grapefruit. There's solid hop flavor too, but it's quite dominated by the bitterness. I also get a little more citrus and grapefruit than the nose would let on. Again, the malt is practically absent, there is no real sweetness or anything really, to hint at the presence of grain. Drying on the finish with a lingering resiny grapefruit and pine bitterness. Thoroughly enjoyable, it's something I'd love to try again. And it also has me intrigued in the 1000 IBU beer coming up!","DefenCorps","Jan 06, 2010"
