3.82,6.4,3.75,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Very enjoyable beer that tasted better poured than from the can. The pilsner malt flavor wasn't over bearing or too strong as is the case with most pilsners. It was a well balanced beer. There was little to no hop aroma or flavor. It was very light in color and taste.","mediumtommy","Apr 22, 2014"
3.53,-1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Yes, yet another can courtesy of the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts, a touch of sweetness. Taste is crisp, malts, grains, a touch of bitterness at the finish, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking, refreshing beer.","tone77","Apr 15, 2014"

3.78,5.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"A nice, loud Crack! revealed a brimful CAN, so in salute to the brewers, I utilized an inverted Glug. The pseudo-cascade was brilliant, finally settling into two fingers of dense, foamy, bone-white head with great retention. Color was like liquid sunshine with a slight haziness (SRM = 4 to 5), perfect for a rainy spring afternoon. The three gold stooges, Croesus, Mammon and Midas seemed to agree as they all showed up for a taste, but I was having none of it. It had a nicely controlled spicy nose, just enough to tickle my sinuses and get my mouth watering, but not enough to be too much of a good thing. Mouthfeel was medium and the Saaz hops really interacted well with the yeast and the malt knew enough to stand pat, creating the king of Pilsner that I really dig. Too many AALs under the bridge and GER Pilsners tend to be too sweet for my liking. Finish was dry, slightly spicy, slightly grassy and definitely refreshing. This would be ideal on a hot, humid summer's day.","woodychandler","Mar 31, 2014"

The taste has that nice grassy, lemony, doughy characteristic found in a summery pils. The finish has a nice hoppy bite followed by a clean crisp maltiness.

3,-16.4,3,3,3,3,3,"From a growler fill from Brazen Head. Pours a light straw color with small sized head. Smells slightly floral with a bit of banana action.
