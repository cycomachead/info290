Smell is of intense skunk that eventually dissipates somewhat, malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

This contributed to the lesser feel rating. With that said, the beer was still rather smooth. I really wanted to like this beer. Maybe it just didn't travel well or maybe it was old.

The aroma has more going for it than a Saaz hop smell. Definately pick up on a sweeter malt bill than others of the style. The hops also smell fresh rather than skunky. Definately benefits from being fresh. The flavor starts dry and bitter but finishes from a slightly sweet note. Plenty of hop flavor in this one. The Saaz are nicely featured. The body is light and crisp. Dry without some relief from a touch of sweet. I do not know what the other reviewers were drinking, but this is a fine example of a pils.

Maybe they improved it lately or maybe I just had a fresh bottle? Anyways this time around this stuff was damn good. Plenty of hop flavour of the saaz variety I think and accompanied by a decent malty character as well. I dont remember it being this hoppy before. The level of bitterness is just right though- strong but not too overpowering. Full flavoured but drinkable. It produced a substantial head too that lingered til the last drop and had a full aroma of hops. Those Czechs know what they're doing when it comes to beer making I'll tell ya.

Firm bitterness, but lacking some of the spice and zing of other Czech pils. The finish is dry and fairly clean with just enough sweetness. This is a light bodied and very quaffable beer.

I'm sure that this beer has lost a little of its character during its long trip from central Europe to the shelves of my local beer store, but it is still in pretty good shape and I can't find too much to complain about here.

Not bad, I'm pleasantly surprised, I wasn't expecting much when I bought it, I thought it was going to be a Euro strong lager type of beer based on the imperial designation, but it's a decent Czech pils.","Drew966","Sep 24, 2007"

For starters, the bottle I got was not stale, which is a frequent problem with European imports. Secondly, I'm sure it helps that I've just arrived home from cycling back from work on a warm summer day. Anyway, after having caught my breath, I can smell the grainy aroma with some spicy-herbal-grassy hops and a hint of corniness. About how I'd expect a Czech Pils to smell. The flavor is clean and malty with a brisk hoppy bite in the finish and a mildly tart yogurt-like tangy aftertaste. All in all, I've had better Czech Pilseners, but this one is drinkable, especially if you've gotten yourself all hot and thirsty first.","ctdfalconer","Jun 20, 2007"

Clean, pale malt palette with bread flavors and a slightly grassy finish. Begins with a soft, hoppy aroma which returns and mellows at the finish. Pleasantly watery mouthfeel - fuller, like tap water, rather than overly crisp filtered water. Very drinkable, though I only have one. For an inexpensive imported pilsener, this one is richer in flavor and aroma than Urquell, well-balanced, but without the crispness and subtle hop bite.","BoucheGulp","Apr 12, 2007"

2.86,-17.6,3,2,3,3,3.5,"Probably a less than average beer per style. Partly due to the dangerously-near skunk aroma that eminates from the bottle and into the glass. Even with a typical pale straw color and abundance of carbonation, the beer lacks promise early and often. Flavors turn out sweet but quickly follow up with a grainy bite, lemony astringency, and a watery body.

The initial taste is malt, but the hops are there from the start, giving a nice flowery bite in the finish. The amazing thing, though, is the aftertaste, which kicks in a full 30 seconds after the liquid goes down. Smooth bitterness overwhelms the mouth from the throat up and forward. Wow!
