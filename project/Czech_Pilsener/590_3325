The beer was a golden yellow color when poured into a glass. The aroma was a biscuity beer aroma, that is what your grandfather's beer smelled like, but better. On the initial taste, one detects smooth grassy notes with a mild creaminess. Mild notes of lemon are hidden in the background. The carbonation is well-balance and not overly aggressive. The Earthy grass of the aftertaste lingers in the mouth for an appropriate duration before it is swept away by the carbonation. Edel-Pils is a nice smooth, easy drinker.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 23, 2013"

The scent is quite grainy with a slight hint of hops. The taste is superb for a pilsner! Lots of rich flavor of grains, malts, and hops combine together to make a well balanced brew! This beer will pair quite well with most foods as it’s very simple yet very tasty.","Lemke10","Mar 23, 2013"

The foam was one finger in height and the head retention was decent, it faded to a skimpy cap after a few moments. Subsequent lacing was stringy and unorganized. It looks like a Pilsner. The nose is uncomplicated but articulate. It is succinct like a dictionary definition and this beer would be the very entry for a Pilsner. Both the nose and palate are ideal for the style. The bouquet is largely malt with tons of crisp biscuit aromas, hints of grain but the maltiness is concisely Pils. Nice. Hops play a secondary role but their influence is easily noticeable, they offer some flowery, lemony smells. Clean. Tremendously inviting. I wish the potency were a little louder. In a word the palate is great. IMO, if you cant dig this beer you just dont like Pilsners. Im not knocking you if you dont; I happen too love it. The malt backbone is perfect, great strength, very firm and so damn tasty! It offers very slight and succulent sweetness that dances a sexy tango with the biscuit flavors. A trace of grain is a distant wallflower. Speaking of flowers, the hops contribute such a taste along with the most modest kiss of lemon. Great stuff. There is no start or finish, just full-on flavor at all times. The aftertaste really elevates this beer, it is a sense it is clean but I dont forget what I just had. I dont want that empty feeling either. Good crispness. Super refreshing. This is the best Pilsner Ive had. Yummy! Medium/medium-full in body, modest but natural carbonation, it is ideal for this style of beer. The mouthfeel has some bulk and it has a very pleasant essence to it. Nice. Amazingly drinkable! This would be a great everyday beer or a BBQ beer or even a beer for the macro-lager crowd. Im very impressed.

3.71,-3.4,4,3,4,3.5,4,"This poured with a nice, bubbly, white head that quickly gave way, but there was still a great deal of CO2 evident in the glass. It had an extremely light mouthfeel with a grassy/alfalfa aftertaste presenting itself on the finish. Overall, it was a very smooth, dry, light beer. I think that it would be very good on a hot, humid day, the polar opposite of the day that I tried it, but it is still not bad for a Pils.","woodychandler","Jun 28, 2004"

4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2" of white head over the straw-hued brew. Lacing is excellent. Aroma is lightly of pale malts, but I've never found pilsner-styles to overcome my lame sniffer, so if I smell anything, it must be significant. Taste is solid pale malts, with a crisp hit of slightly fruity hops at the outset. Refreshing. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. Great summertime brew.","ppoitras","Mar 01, 2004"
3.8,-1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5,"This is supposedly a pilsner, yet neither I nor any of my beer-testing buddies would call it so. It is a good beer tho and very drinkable. It tastes exactly like their Norski, less the sweetness. I'm tempted to rate it lower for missing its category (pilsner) but it's a good (albeit plain) beer.","TheOtherMike","Feb 01, 2004"

4.08,6.3,4,3.5,4,5,4.5,"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is malty. Very smooth tasting pilsner. Slightly malty and hoppy for a pilsner. Nice flavor, very smooth. Somewhat sweet. Kind of citrusy, some apples and lemon taste. This is a very nice pilsner. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Jun 24, 2003"
3.63,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Picked this one up on my trip to Milwaukee. It poured to a clear, golden color, with a white head. It left a good amount of lacing when sipped down. It had a crisp, grainy, and semi-sweet aroma, with a bit of hop spiciness. The flavor is clean with a sweet, grainy flavor that flows to a soft, spicy hop bitterness. It has a soft malt background. It is smooth and light. Has a nice finish. Highly drinkable.","BeerBuilder","May 21, 2003"
4.08,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,5,"Crystal clear light golden hue, topped by a persistent, thick, pitted, porcelain white head. Tattered lace remains. Soft grass and chlorophyll hop nose with a citric tinge upfront in aroma, accompanied by mildly sweet, doughy malt and faint husk. Rounded, bready, pilsner malt sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by stately, drying combination of moderate hop bitterness and mineralized, lightly salty cracker. Urbane, judiciously dextrinous mouthfeel, partially from the well calculated attenuation. Agreeably attuned, mildly herbal, sweet basil esque hop flavor surfaces transiently mid palate, then fades allowing dry, spicy biscuit reminscent of malted rye to persist through the trim, simply grainy finish. A comely balanced pilsner with emphasis on its soft grain presence; overall hop character is secondary. Edel - Pils is light, almost airy on the palate and superbly drinkable. Tasty! Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the delivery.","marc77","May 20, 2003"
3.61,-6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A very drinkable but unremarkable pils. It pours a nice golden color with bright white head. It has a somewhat malty aroma with noble hop grassiness on the mild side. The flavor is bisquit malt with some floral hop pop in the finish. It has a crisp light body and dry finish with the malt giving a little bit of a body boost. A good summer beer.","jeffboo","May 01, 2003"

3.83,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is a light, crisp, refreshing pilsner beer that is perfect for quenching your thirst on a hot day. A gentle malt sweetness is evident, but the beer is still hoppy enough to be called a pilsner. There is none of the six-row malt huskiness that is sometimes found in microbrewed pilsners, but there was a slight noticeable buttery note, that is a bit inappropriate for the style.","marcobrau","Jul 16, 2002"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This crystal clear golden brew throws a nice creamy off-white head that sticks around for a little while.  There are some orange tints noticeable also.   Malt tones blend nicely with the noble hop accents on the nose.  The spiciness noted isn't as great as true Bohemian or German style pilseners, but it's nice.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Body seems to be about medium full.  This is a very thirst quenching brew.  Great subdued maltiness and hoppiness.  Some spicy hop notes surface midway through.  Nice malt backbone the whole way through.  Very nice brew, but I do prefer their Hometown Blonde which is more of a true European style pilsener.","Bighuge","May 21, 2002"
4.33,12.8,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Looks a little like apple juice in the glass....initial head fades quickly(seconds rather than minutes) to a flat looking beer....AMAZING clarity...nose if of bready malt....I love the way this tastes...It is my kind of Pilsner, but true Pilsener lovers might appreciate more of a hop bite. It has a strong bready malt flavor with just a twinge of a dry hop finish. Extremely drinkable....a great summer beer and my type of Pilsner with a nice malt impression..","ZAP","Apr 12, 2002"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"For those who don't think a pilsener can be a good beer, think again.  Edel-Pils is a fine pilsener, if not one of the best I've ever tried.  Pours out to a darker, but still bright, golden color in the glass with a slightly off-white head that sticks around for awhile.  Smell is that or faint yeast, but somewhat faintly sweet.  Taste is that of a great hop to malt balance, with a slightly sweet tinge to it.  Very similar to a European pils, i.e. Pilsener Urquell, Czechvar, etc, but better.  Highly drinkable.","proc","Apr 08, 2002"
4.32,12.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very nice looking Pilsner beer, deep amber, almost red color.  The head turned flat very quickly.  Very nice aroma, earthy, fresh mown hay aroma.  Rich malt flavors, deep mouth feel, smooth flavors throughout the after-taste.  This is a wonderful smooth beer, with deep layered tastes throughout.  I like this beer.","jackndan","Beers"
