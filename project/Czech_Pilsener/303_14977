3.85,16.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a 16 oz. goblet. A gorgeous, deep golden color. Very little head, and what there was didn’t last long. Very little visual evidence of carbonation. An unusually strong smell of malted barley and Saaz hops. I could actually smell it at arms length in the bottle before I poured it! Taste is very sweet with a hint of sour after the swallow. I kept waiting for that strong hop bitterness that my nose detected earlier, but it was subtle and came on gradually. More complex than the better-known Czech pilsners that I’m used to drinking. Soft carbonation. Smooth, with a heavier body than I expected. Not very bitter, but what there is stays with you a long time. There’s a thick, buttery feel on the tongue long after the glass is empty. I’ve always loved Czech pilsners and I think I’ll be calling this one my favorite, at least for now. Easy drinking but with some complexity as well!","kvnstfrd","Nov 14, 2012"

It's complex without being extreme or challenging, in the manner of good English pale to golden ales. It's definitely not an American beer, at either extreme--the big, brash, bold craft beers (hooray!) or the sweet mass-produced pap of Budweiser/Coors/etc (boo!).

The head steadily settles into a wide, foamy collar that leaves only average lacing behind. The nose is grassy and floral over a bready malt... basic, clean, concise. The flavor offers a little more oomph with a wider, but still very straight-forward, maltiness and even stronger hop flavors. A bold bitterness balances it, and it finishes quite dry with a lingering bitterness that's strewn with grassy and spicy hop flavors.

3.76,13.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I am always hopeful but wary when I reach for a European lager with a shiny, shiny label in green glass bottles. I am hopeful because fine and delicious brew is often found therein. Wary because as often as not, the beer has been treated to sub-optimum conditions and has become skunky. Sure this could happen to virtually any beer, but it is more common in central and eastern European lagers, because they have to travel so far, they use a lot of green glass, and a lot of hops. So I opened my B.B. Bürgerbräu with tempered expectations. What I got was just a very faint hint of the feared skunkiness, which I was willing to bear if the reward was good enough. Aside from the mild skunk, I found the aroma to be pleasantly perfumey-floral-hoppy. The flavor had a nicely full malty sweetness well countered by a healthy dose of hop bitterness, leaving a crisp, dry finish. It's not quite as rich as Czechvar (Budvar) or as spicy-hoppy as Pilsener-Urquell, but very easy to drink to be sure. Another solid Czech lager that I would happily drink again...if it's fresh.","ctdfalconer","Nov 15, 2006"

3,-9.4,3,3,3,3,3,"500 ml brown bottle, bought in Denmark. ABV there is 4.7%. Golden colour, moderate head. Moderate aroma - some grass, flowers and honey. Flavour is fairly clean with a moderately hoppy finish, aftertaste does not last forever. An average drinkable pilsener, but not much more than that.","Sigmund","Mar 26, 2006"
2.48,-25.1,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"B.B. Burgerbrau is supposed to be the forerunner of the modern day Budweiser (the American one). I'm not sure that's something to be proud of given how the 'King of Beers' tastes, but facts is facts and if the brewery wants to trumpet that particular fact from the highest mountaintop, more power to 'em. Frankly, neither one of them is worth a damn.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 25, 2006"
3.27,-1.2,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Opinion: I was a little disappointed in this beer. It is really clean, and would show even the slightest flaw...so in that respect it is a good beer. The balance is really weak for even a lighter style of beer. I believe that it should start with a lot more depth in the malt to help round out the beer. It is an OK beer, but not one that I will be seeking out any time soon.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 10, 2006"

2.98,-10,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Well, this beer is very easy to drink. It would make a nice session beer in the summer but as a Czech Pils worth going back for, I think not. Still, I wont turn one down. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA. It is worth a try but it fails to represent its style to the fullest.","bditty187","Jan 06, 2006"
2.55,-23,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,3,"The flavors in this brew fall on the borderline of subtle and bland. A bit more "watery" than I would expect from the Czechs, arguably the best pils brewers in the world. This is easy to drink, and the flavors that are here aren't bad, but it just seems that there isn't enough of them in this brew.","Beastdog75","Dec 15, 2005"

Starts on the sweet side but then the grassy/skunkiness/hops kick in, typical euro pilsner and in a green bottle. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma.","jdhilt","0"
3.06,-7.6,4,3,3,3,3,"Mediocre, macro tasting, skunk fest, with a nice noble hop finish not too unlike Becks. Very good head for the style. Slow rising and steady carbonation. Slightly tart, metallic, medium bodied mouthfeel. Tastes likebeer. There seems to be real potential here but unfortunately this one falls ill to the European green bottle flu. Ill try it next time Im over there and see if there is any difference but for now this one is just average. Drank several bottles at a bar over a long period of time with the same result.","DaPeculierDane","Nov 27, 2005"
3.65,10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The color is golden with a nice level of carbonation. Head is creamy and of medium height. Retention is okay. The aroma is clean, I was expecting skunk from the green bottle. Sweet, grainy smells dominate. The taste is dominated by sweet malts with an undercurrent of grainy, grassy flavor. Hop flavor most noticed at the beginning of a sip, other than that hop presence is much less than expected from a pils. A creamy mouthfeel is a plus and the drinkability is excellent.","Gagnonsux","Nov 19, 2005"

4.23,27.8,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This came fresh on tap at the Scottish Arms. It poured deep straw gold and was topped with a thick white champagne head. The aroma is dominated by noble hops, all flower, with just a touch of citrus. Taste is a wonderful hop punch, not overly bitter, just a nice fresh hop character. More orange citrus. Light slick mouth feel very quenching. This was the 2nd time Id enjoyed this beer this week. This time from proper glassware (nice fluted mug rather than thick glass one it came in last time). Really is nice to enjoy fresh draft pilsner.","carln26","Oct 27, 2005"

3.66,10.6,4,3,4,4,3.5,"This is a quaffable import lager. Poured out to a rich golden color with a nice white foamy head and medium high carbonation. Some traces of lace in the glass. Aromas were weak, but notes of hops and grain were noted. Taste was simple yet enjoyable. Flavors of hops and grain are accented by the mild malt that is not too thick or overpowering. Mouthfeel is nice; crisp and light while still maintaining a good level of refreshing depth. Decent drinkability. This brew would be best consumed with some chicken or pizza, or as a summer brew. I think I may find myself back with this beer toward the warmer months of the year. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Oct 09, 2005"
3.88,17.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is light and smooth. I like this specifically because it is not too sweet, a curse of too many standard lagers. Yeah, I'd put this into the lager category rather than a pilsner. I could definitely session this.","assurbanipaul","Oct 07, 2005"
3.85,16.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"So I learned more than I ever though about Burgerbrau yesterday. Gregg Glaser, the news editor of All About Beer magazine, asked me to pick up a six pack of this for his discussion at the World Beer Festival since his topic was beers in the news. After talking to the Southeast US representative for the brewery, he seemed surprisingly hesitant to offer his brew up. After talking to Greg, he explained why it was in the news -- apparently AB is suing them out in Europe for their use of the word Budweiser as one of the B's. He seemed cool after talking to Greg and the beer actually was very good. Much better than Pilsner Urquell. Beautifully light golden with excellent carbonation and very easy to drink. Seemed to be a positive experience with most everyone sitting through the discussion.","Backer2004","Oct 05, 2005"
3.85,16.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours golden in color with a short white head that soon fades into a wispy lace. Nose is fresh grains with a bit of floral hops. A mild mustiness and earthiness is in the background. Fairly light in body though not too thin. Taste begins with lightly sweet malts followed by grassy hops that become more bitter towards the end of the taste. A pretty nice pilsner to be had here.","Morris729","Sep 28, 2005"

3.65,10.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is hard to find on BA, because as others have noted, the US import bottles list a diferent brewery all together. Thank god for the picture of the bottle! Anyway, the beer is a darn nice looking very gold (like a shiny coin). Since I poured it, I had a lovely inch of creamy white foam, but alas where did it go? Aroma is probably its bext feature: rich, bready, perfumey. Tastewise, it is not bad, maltyness tingued with some perfumey hops. The sweetness in the finish was a bit noticeable...perhaps a touch more sharp carbonation would have evened that out.","PatandDavid","Aug 17, 2005"

3.21,-3,4,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Pours a brilliantly clear gold color with copper highlights. The head is fairly thin, frothy and a pale off white color. The aroma is ever so slightly skunked and has notes of toasted malt and lightly spicy hops. The taste is fairly thin, with a bit of malty sweetness to it and a finish that spicy, herbal and a bit bitter. There is a certain bready, toasted maltiness here though it is competing with the thin wateriness of the body. There is a bit of light struck character in this beer as well, though it is not all that strong, thankfully. This is actually not too bad, not nearly as good as I was hopping for a Czech beer.","Gueuzedude","Dec 21, 2003"

There's a good malt opening, followed by a mild and somewhat metallic hoppiness. Mixed in here is more sweet than I would have expected. The aftertaste retains some of the mild bitterness, but fades quickly. This is an uninspired brew..","Globetrotter","0"
