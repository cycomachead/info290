Light bitterness that remains for a short while. Carbonation is a tad low, with a bit of crispiness that I think could have been more pronounced with a better carbonation level. Medium body however.

The aroma is chalk full of floral sazz and dripping with fresh hay and grass, with some good grainy rye notes. Czech sipcy hops fill the mouth with flavour, floral flavours follow. Fresh cut grass, greens, hay, a touch of lemon zest. Very crisp fizzy finish, lots of fresh hops, good bitterness in the finish. I'd say this is a fine classic example.

The aroma reminds me of lemon dish soap, but breaking is down further I might suggest it is a mix of lemon, grass and celery, which would be expected. Nonetheless, I don't find it particularly welcoming. The flavour is initially rich with this aroma, and the smooth texture helps to reinforce the idea of soapiness. Its not unpleasant, but again not something that I'm really looking for. Thankfully, after a while this settles down, and a sweet maltiness takes over for the rest of the ride. A nice level of floral hoppy bitterness lurks out the edges, helping to keep this pils nice and refreshing. No doubt I could drink another of these to quench my thirst on a hot day, but whether I would do so with so many other good brew available is unlikely.","bobsy","Oct 21, 2007"

Aroma of medium sweet malt with some nice floral notes provided by the hops. Taste is also dominated by some notes of sweet malt with some nice hoppy floral notes. Very refreshing overall while respecting the style guideline.","Phyl21ca","Sep 22, 2007"
3.01,-14.7,3.5,2.5,3,4,3,"The descriptor on the can says their brewmaster visited Czechlosovakia to study and replicate the true Czech pilsners. Sorry to say he missed the mark. This one needs lots more hop character and depth to make a true Czech pils. Not recommended.","marksto","Sep 09, 2007"
2.79,-21,4,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"After try a few Canadian beers from the can, I must admit I was ready to judge this one by its cover. I'd tried a supposed "IPA" that was really just a lager, with hardly any hops to be tasted, so when I read "Pilsner" on the side of this can I got worried before even taking the first sip. Therefore when I did try the first sip I was pleasantly surprised. It does taste like a pilsner! Unfortunately after a few more sips the cloying sweetness sets in and the lack of hops becomes more noticeable. Overall it's pretty average. I had a hard time finishing it and actually ended up throwing half of it away.","JayTheFinn","Aug 22, 2007"
3.51,-0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Very approachable & balanced, but a little too much sweetness for me.","Derek","Aug 20, 2007"
3.7,4.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A very clear, pale straw hue in the glass with a hint of amber but light coloured. I found the head a bit soapy at first with large bubbles that lingered, eventually left with a ring of froth around the glass and a few clear spots here and there. The carbonation was good with a bit of staying power. An aroma of freshly cut grass and a touch of balsa wood. Smooth and a touch foamy in the mouth with pronounced hops, dry. A touch of spice in the finish surprized me. Balanced bitterness; overall I'm impressed for this style of brew, but then again, I started out as a Pilsner drinker years ago so I may be embellishing a little.","ThatWineGuy","Aug 15, 2007"
3.48,-1.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is a well-balanced bitterness, grapefruit, and a drop of honey. Very drinkable and very surprising. I had pretty well assumed that this would be a bomb, considering the Molson purchase. I'm glad to see that it hasn't yet affected the output of the brewery. That said, it doesn't really go out of its way to justify being a special edition or whatever it is. It's just a pilsner.","JustinBathurst","Aug 06, 2007"
3.5,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I'm not a pilsner fan, generally, but I grabbed a couple of tall cans of this from the LCBO just to try it out. For a pilsner, it's not bad! Nice, slightly darker-than-average colour with a solid white head (poured into a pilsner glass). Mild but pleasant malty aroma with a bit of a spritzy lemon/spice note to it. Taste is pleasantly hoppy but subtle, with very little of that pilsner funk/skunk/"beery" taste that I dislike. Nice mouthfeel, although a little more carbonation than I usually like in a beer in general. Drinkable, and would be great to have a few of these outside, grilling chicken or something on a sunny day.","crwills","Jul 07, 2007"
3.72,5.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The palate is sweet, malty with some a well balanced hop profile. Dry and bitter finish. A great take on a Czech Pilsener.","irishkyle21","Jul 06, 2007"
3.01,-14.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Taste is a bit better, but that soapiness is still lingering a bit. Nice grassy, peppery hop profile though, and there's a slight nuttiness to the grainy malt that I like as well. Bitterness is clean and complimentary, not overwhelming. Body isn't too light or anything, and it slides down pretty easy. Dry finish. Carbonation is just right for the style. If it wasn't for that unpleasant soapy note in the aroma and in the taste, this would probably be above average for me, but as it stands, it's just another pilsner.","trevorwideman","Jun 09, 2007"
3.95,11.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep gold color with a tight white head. Foam recedes, but never disappears leaving a thin cap and this stings of lace. Some malt aroma with just enough floral hops. Clean tasting brew, nice mix of malt and hop bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, light yet creamy, dry finish. It is almost easier to describe what isn't there - no adjunct sweetness, no sour finish, no big carbonation bubbles for that bloated feeling. The more I drink the more I like. A very good beer, lots of flavor, without one aspect being overpowering.","BigBry","Jun 02, 2007"
3.72,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear golden, one finger white head forms, settles down to a thin ring, leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet and grassy, citrus, cereal, sugar, bit of spicy hopping, not too bad. Taste is sweet and malty, very bready cereal character, citrus, bit of floral, grainy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkable, pretty decent drink, has some nice character.","Viggo","Jun 01, 2007"
3.7,4.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall even if its not a traditional pilsner, its still right up there with some of my favorite pilsners. The big advantage this beer has is that it tastes so fresh. Recommended.","drinkininthewood","May 28, 2007"
3.65,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is in no way a traditional pilsner, only in a very broad sense. Good malty aroma. It was so-so lagerish up front, and decent bitterness on back like a maibock hits me. Drinkable with some creamy mouthfeel, and overall, probably because so fresh and new, a decent refreshing and positive surprise beer. I would send it as a hitchhiker, but not worth especially trading for. Dry aftertaste.","Sammy","May 27, 2007"
3.95,11.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D - I like this a lot, good flavour yet still refreshing.","allergictomacros","May 22, 2007"
3.7,4.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"All in all, Creemore's Traditional Pilsner lacks the complexity of the other major Ontario pilsners. But its simplicity is also its strength - what is here is quite tasty, and I would take it over King Pilsner almost any day. Creemore's flagship lager has certainly gone downhill in the past year, but this is a nice reminder of the brewery's potential. If only they'd try their hands at a stout or even a wheat beer.","headlessparrot","May 22, 2007"
3.75,6.2,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"The answer is this is fresher and even if it is deficient in several factors as a "tradtional" Czech pils, a fresh impersonator is better than a stale or over dated authentic import.","pootz","Beers"
