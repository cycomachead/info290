Malt sweetness seems dominant. Flavor is lemony and minerally upfront, finishing earthy and lightly bitter. There's a bit of malt sweetness at the backbone, finishing crackery and dry. Very easy drinking, approachable beer with a balanced malt and hop profile.","barczar","Jul 25, 2014"

3.84,2.1,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours a clean, pale, urine-yellow color. A tight white head of small bubbles forms to a about a half finger’s width and then fizzles to a scrim. The head leaves a sticky lacing of thin, hole-ridden sheets on the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is lager clean and full of nicely-paced bubbles that feed the head. No particles are present in the beer, and it seems entirely free of any haze. On the nose, the beer smells delicate, crisp, and hoppy with Noble spice. A strong, light caramel note gives the nose a light stickiness, while still remaining delicate. Herbal grass and light dankness can also be sensed in the beer, nicely showcasing the Noble hops. On the tongue, the beer tastes soft and floral sweet. Gentle bitterness touches the palate in the middle of the sip and carries on into the finish, providing some nice balance. The sweetness does incorporate some fruitier aspects, and a light citric acidity can be sensed on the sides of the cheeks, but in all his beer is delicate and balanced. The beer feels light in body, with a crisp, slightly slick mouthfeel and a soft carbonation that still carries a little bite on the tongue. The flavor begins as light grass and flowers with a soft spice. Caramel and cracker malt move in after a while, bringing with them a sweet, almost apple juice flavor that I sometimes detect in pilsners. Faint salt character can be detected on the back of the tongue. The finish is softly citric lemon peel with a touch of cracker and grass. The aftertaste is mellow cracker malt. Overall, this is a nicely reserved beer with some great balance. The apple juice sweetness does briefly get a little too much for the subtlety of the style, but never too much so. The beer is soft, and perfect for a fatigued palate or a midweek drink.","Maxwell","Sep 15, 2013"

Pours a nice golden color with a 1/2 inch foam head. The aroma is of grassy earth and hops. Taste is nice, a hoppy version of a Czech Pils. Give this one a try for sure, and the best part is that it's available in all major grocery stores. Cheers!","CoachC","Jul 26, 2013"

Aromas of lemon zest, orange, herbal, floral, grapefruit, bread, cracker, pine, and light earth. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of orange zest, lemon, pine, herbal, floral, grapefruit, bread, grass, and light earth. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, floral, bread, grass, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Great flavor balance with a nice amount of delicious citrus hoppiness. No cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a delicious Pilsner! Great hop flavor profile and balance; extremely smooth to drink. Very enjoyable.","superspak","Sep 17, 2012"

The hops come through nicely on the nose and palate and after that you'll find a surprisingly full-flavored beer. The session beer for hopheads! This one has mass appeal too, although from talking to a Sam Adams rep I learned that even this beer is too hoppy for a lot of Americans and so they swapped this one out for Alpine Spring as their spring tap this year. That's quite a shame, because this is one of their best beers. Glad to have found it still available in 6 packs though!","TheRealBigC","Aug 02, 2012"

3.93,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall I thought that this was a good beer that impressed me a little and I thought that it was a good example of a proper Czech Pilsener, this was a very clean and crisp beer that did a great job in keeping true to the style. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth and it had enough nice and clean flavors to hold my attention, I could see drinking two or three of these when in the mood for an easy drinking Pilsener. What I liked most about this beer was the clean flavors, the mouthfeel, and the great drinkability, they were all really well done and made this a good beer. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness in the aroma, it could be toned down a little to make the aroma more appealing. I would actually buy this beer again on it's own, I think it would make for a nice beer to take to a bbq or to drink on the disc golf course, I wouldn't rule out buying some of this when in the mood for an easy drinking Pilsener. I was actually a little impressed with this beer, I don't remember liking it that much when I first had it, but now that I have more experience in the style i can appreciate how crisp and clean this beer really is. Samuel Adams did a good job with this beer and made one solid Czech Pilsener, but I still think that Short's Pontius Road Pilsener is my favorite of the style, it was just a little more flavorful and aromatic, but I think this one is crisper and easier drinking, so they are both good in their own right. This is one solid beer overall.","StoutHunter","Jun 12, 2012"

Smell is a conglomeration of herbal, spicy, and peppery hop aromas with some malt in there as well. Taste is very much the same with a malt flavor that comes through on the aftertaste. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip that fades slowly. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

The delicious blend of hops creates an infusion of flavor that you cannot capture during the first bottle. You struggle to discover all the notes even after 2 or 3 bottles. It's a beer that makes you appreciate the fact that your taste buds work. Savor it, sip it, engage it and by all means, respect this beer. It's almost near perfect.

The first notes of the aroma was pine fading to some lemon and citrus notes. The taste was piney, citrusy, and with a light bready malt finish. The mouthfeel was nice and carbonated, clean, and medium body. This pilsner is a nice break from from the standard formula of one malt and one hops. It blends the aroma of an IPA with the cleanness of a pilsner. I'll buy this beer again with no hesitation.","Rantingfury","May 13, 2012"

While it is unconvincing as a Bohemian pilsner--even by American craft standards--it excels as a double dry-hopped sessionable IPL. Malt is under-represented, compromising the balance that should at least be present at the table when pilsner lagers are discussed. It is for this reason that is cannot measure up to the finest American-brewed pilsners, such as Victory Prima Pils or Green Flash Fizzy Yellow Beer. Still, this beer accomplishes a lot, not the least of which is being equal in overall appeal to most good IPAs.","beagle75","Mar 20, 2012"

The aroma contains a solid hop presence, more so on the earthy side, definite hay. Flavor is light hay, some sweet honey, and some earthy hops. Smooth finishes means easy drinking all day long, adequate carbonation. This was pretty nicely done by SA as an easy access pilsner. Nothing groundbreaking, but one of my favorites from them.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

Flavor providesa nice hop character good for introducing the noble hop variety with floral and citrus, mostly lemon, notes. Light to medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall a nice offering from Sam Adams which grows on you as you drink it.","kylehay2004","Jan 19, 2012"

3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"With all 5 noble hops I was expecting a choke down, but knowing Sam's I knew it would be a decent style but nothing earth shattering. Pours clean and pale yellow into pint glass, crisp smelling blend of hops with a light head of about an eighth of an inch. Pleasantly surprised by the good burst of hops in the front end which gives way to a nice clean finish. Could definitely enjoy a couple with a meal or a few in a sitting. I would like to try this on tap...now if I could only get their wonderful scotch ale in a six again instead of the winter mixer 12, the scotch ale is still my personal favorite from Sam's after the quad bock","Blueribbon666","Oct 01, 2011"

3.83,1.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Reasonably tasty, clean and crisp. Hoppier than the typical Czech pils, but of course, that ain't saying much. Still, it retains much of the traditional pils characteristics and then adds a bit more of a hoppy punch than is typical of the style. A worthy effort, but yet still something I won't be having too often outside the airport.","sprucetip","Sep 04, 2011"
3.5,-6.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This pours a hazy golden yellow hue and average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that stays and leaves sporadic lacing,the smell is grassy lemony hops,light toffee and citrus,the mouthfeel is lightbodied and has tastes of lemon zest,mandarin,white grapes and finished with a twist of tart grapefruit rind and chewy caramel and overall its very drinkable but not overly memorable cheers.","ADZA","Aug 09, 2011"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This is quite tasty and refreshing; the hop character is really quite fresh and piquant, even though I get the feeling it was even more so when this beer was fresher.

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O - Could use a bit more flavor like most sam adams brews, but a good beer that I am more than happy to drink. Leagues and bounds better than a bud or miller.","Jerone","Jul 27, 2011"
4.35,15.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The nose is alive with subtle hits of grass and citrus; very nice, extremely pleasant. The palate is graced with a spattering of lemon drops that quietly dissolves beheind a mild hop finish. The wonderfully crisp mouthfeel is refreshing: a great quaff for a hot summer day.

Golden yellow color and about one inch of white head with several little bubbles going from the bottom of my glass to the top, definitely looks like a pils. The smell and taste are almost identical... bready pale malts, spicy medium hop flavor and that distinctive Samuel Adams taste/smell. Does it come from their in house yeast? Even though it's a pils I can't shake that Samuel Adams flavor that you get from the Boston lager. Mouthfeel is okay, could have a bit more carbonation for the style. Overall, this beer is just okay. Not as good as the pilsners made by Victory or Avery but better than what the macros put out.","thedindaniel","Jul 01, 2011"
3.95,5.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pilsner glass, this has a best before July date on the back. It pours a nice light golden color very nice foamy white head which leaves a foam trail as it dissipates. The smell is nice, the hops are present and grassy / grainy, very good. The mouth feel is crisp, light nice carbonation. The taste is very good, crisp lager taste, some sweet malts with a hoppy after taste, very good but not quite a hoppy as I remembered when it was fresher and on tap, but still very good, one of the better SA products (and when fresher and on tap I thought it might be the best, too bad I didn't review it then).","DavidST","Jun 30, 2011"

3.1,-17.6,3,3,3,4,3,"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pour hazy golden color with white head. Nice, sticky lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of honey, corn, and hay. Taste is sweet with light bitterness. A bit of a metallic note as well. Medium to full-bodied with a slick texture. Smooth finish. A decent beer, but not a style I crave.","trappistlover","Jun 23, 2011"
3.53,-6.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Noble Pils pours nicely, has a beautiful golden color and a sudsy white head that doesn't dissipate too quickly. While I do pick up a faint citrus hoppy aroma, I smell more of what I understand to be the traditional "Euro-pilsner" spiced smell that I'm not a huge fan of. The taste is more spiced malt than hops. There's something about the aftertaste of this style that I don't love, but I can tell this is a well-made beer. It has a good mouthfeel and is very drinkable.","mjrod2142","Jun 21, 2011"

4.2,11.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"M: The mouthfeel has lemony citrus and herbal flowers, a strength without a bite. Quite possibly Sam Adams's best seasonal.","akorsak","Jun 04, 2011"
3.85,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Nice light tasting beer that hits pretty square on the head its promise: being the Sam Adams Spring Seasonal. Great to enjoy on a nice spring afternoon.","bristei","Jun 03, 2011"
3.8,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured cold into a large mug this pilsner is a bright, clear, golden color with a decent white fuzz on top and steady lace. The aroma is a deep honey bread and light yeast. Nice for the style. The flavor is even deeper honey wheat with a sweet yeast and oat hint. There's a fair citrus hop overtone that catches my tastebuds as well. The feel is relatively thick and smooth, medium-plus bodied with modest carbonation. An unusual stick to your ribs type of pilsner. A good one but not the typical thirst quencher variety.","Durge","Jun 02, 2011"
3.42,-9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I'm not the biggest Sam Adams fan as their flagship beers, the Boston Lager and Ale, don't do anything for me. As a result, I didn't have high hopes for this pilsener, but it turned out to be quite tasty. I'm having it at night in front of the TV, but I suspect this would be fantastic on a patio under a sunny sky.","CrumpledFish","Jun 01, 2011"
3.5,-6.9,4,4,3,4,3.5,"A little bit too much going on here, while the flavors are definitely citrusy and bold, this beer is honestly a little unbalanced and a little too bitter. It's pretty good compared to Boston Lager but I think putting all four noble hops into one beer, plus the one additional one that only Jim Koch knows about, might have been a little over kill. The beauty of using noble hops in brewing is that their flavors are distinct and clean, blending them diminishes overall quality immensely.","prosit13","May 30, 2011"
4.07,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Definitely one of the best pilsners I've had and possibly my favourite so far. Victory's Prima Pils is great but is so hopped-up it almost seems like another style altogether. Great ratio of flavour to drinkability; high in both respects. It would be great to run into this one on tap somewhere.","eat","May 29, 2011"
4.35,15.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was just regretting the sameness of all the lagers in BC when this shows up on the shelves. This has lots of hops to make it stand out. Kinda like an IPA with a lager body. Nice hoppy fresh nose with a big hoppy mouthfeel though the lager style comes through in the crispness of the finish. I really liked this beer and would buy it again .","canucklehead","May 24, 2011"

3.5,-6.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was balance. Off the nose, and straight off the taste, the drink reaches a nice interplay between the grainy side and the hoppy side of this beer. They blend well, and the flavoring remains crisp. One criticism is that the hop profile was a bit dulled. With the boasting of five different Noble varieties one would expect a brighter hop presentation than the one given.","TheBrewo","May 23, 2011"
3.55,-5.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: I guess the overall impression or drinkability should be the strong note of this. Yea it's very pleasant and easy to drink (+4.0), but I can't get past how grassy the flavor is (-0.5). There's nothing to push this beer over the top, but it's a prime example of a beer style with mass appeal.","mmva321","May 21, 2011"
3.51,-6.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Served on tap. Noble Pils pours a translucent golden yellow with almost no head. It has a mild but hoppy smell, with just a slight hint of sweetness. The beer is well carbonated and lively on the tongue. It was served a little bit too cold for my liking -- making it difficult to discern the various flavors -- but it tasted mildly hoppy and mellow, with some grass or wheat notes added before the crisp, clean finish. Even as it warms the taste remains relatively mild. This is a nice Spring sipper, but not my favorite Sam.","farlieonfootie","May 21, 2011"
3.36,-10.6,4,3,3,4,4,"Overall- I’m really not sure how this one is rated so high, the smells are overly muted and the taste is almost the exact same, very muted and not much going on.

3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a transparent golden color with visible carbonation. The tall cream colored head left a little lacing in my glass as it slowly receded. The smell is of fresh citrus hops.

4.25,13,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O. Pretty Darn good. Smooth and easy drinking. Reminds me of Urquell but with a more aromatic presence. I wish it were cheaper.

An interesting malt sweetness is present, light spicing and restrained bitterness. Good feel, light body and refreshing.

Lemon, pine, and a hint of tropical fruit from the hops. Firm bitterness, short aftertaste. The longest aspect of the finish is actually the lemon. Strong noble hop character on both palates. Feels a bit more substantial than a lot of pilsners, but still a pretty light-bodied beer. Lively carbonation. Crisp and refreshing. They've done a hell of a good job on this one. I think a great deal of care and craft must have gone into it.","mintjellie","May 07, 2011"

4.05,7.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a clear, yellowish gold with a strong 2 inch fluffy white head. Very clean Noble hop scent accompanies the bready malt scent. This pilsener has a crisp, bready taste with a trace of honey. Light mouth feel with no strong aftertaste at all due to the non-bitter Noble hops blend. A great hops combination here and I am feeling the Bohemian pilsener style that Sam Adams went with for their spring seasonal. A simple and enjoyable brew that is on point.","mindlucent2007","May 06, 2011"

Taste was just OK, with the taste following the aromas pretty closely. I was hoping for a little bit more hop presence, but again I'm not sure of the freshness of this keg so that might have an impact.

I really do like the flavor profile for the most part, though a little less diacetyl and more grains would be nice. This just needs to be a little bigger, I know pilsners tend to be extremely light, but this is just too light. This is a good beer for when you just want something light or there is nothing else. I really do feel like I'm drinking water or a soft drink more than a beer, but it's a nice break from giant hop monsters and -bar aged double stouts.","Satchboogie","Apr 26, 2011"

They aren't kidding about the 5 noble hops, and you can definitely taste them. That doesn't mean that they're overwhelming, though. Overall a very good pils made in the US.

Tastes of Sam Adams usual crystal and pale malts, with a clean hop bitterness, and a touch of citrus. Alot of these Sam Adams beers are starting to all taste of the same basic malts that are being used, and lack complexity often.

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"4's across the board. This one is just plain good. 12 ounce bottle poured into a Samuel Adams PP glass. Color is a bright golden with very little head. Very clear, with loads of carbonation. Aroma is pretty much all noble hops, with a sourdough cracker malt thing going on in the background. Flavor is interesting, and surprisingly intense for a pilsner. Grassy hops coat the mouth first, with a light sourdough malt sweetness in the middle chased by more spicy hop character in the finish. The carbonation keeps things very light in the mouthfeel and the dry finish makes the beer very refreshing. Overall a very pleasant take on the pilsner style, and also a reminder that pils can be more than just the beer we grew up with.","eclaycamp","Apr 08, 2011"

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall I wasn't really a big fan of this one. The skunk aspect was very present in this one and almost overpowering. At least there was a little citrus in the flavor to try and balance this out, but it wasn't even close. Other than the citrus this one just fell short for me.","thagr81us","Apr 08, 2011"

There was very little in the nose except for some citrusy hops. One would think it would have quite an aroma considering they put five different hops in it. (Actually, I don't know why anyone would want to put so many different varieties in unless it's just a gimmick, which I suspect it is.) The appearance was rather pallid, though it had a good head. The mouth feel was extremely light, and the taste was hardly there, with very little malt to speak of. Though it was smooth, there really was no body, no smell, and no taste.

Hoppy aroma, lemony and floral, a bit spicy and herbal, faint aspirin, with some cereal grains and dry malt. Bitterness was solid but not sharp, kind of soft around the edges. More of the same hop and malt character that was evident in the aroma. Lingering citrus and spicy hops. The texture wasn't as crisp as I expected, having much more body and weight, but it was creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. It wasn't highly attenuated either. Overall, it pretty tasty.

Typical malt and grain smells, but with some nice hoppy balancing notes. Bold sour malt and hops flavors riding an extremely crisp and light body. Very crisp, smooth finish with a hoppy and slightly sour aftertaste. The beer is very easy to drink, although the flavors do build as you go.","GarthDanielson","Mar 01, 2011"

I admired the balance of the light malts and crisp, noble hops. It was a clean beer in every sense of the word.

This is the kind of beer that BMC should be making when they claim "Triple Hops Brewed". Now, if you claim that I am somehow overrating this beer; fine, you got me. But it's only on the off chance that I can turn this beer on to someone new to craft beer. Because I know they will have a similar experience to mine for their first time.","BeenJammin","Feb 13, 2011"

4.22,12.2,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Noble Pils pours out light and golden with a fair amount of white, frothy head. After a few minutes, it recedes to a minimal covering with some good lacing. It is slightly sweet in the smell, with notes of honey, apples, and a fresh, citrus and floral hop presence. The taste begins with a hint of herbal spiciness, which introduces the light but enjoyable malt presence that gives off just a touch of honey-like flavor. At mid palate, the hops kick in full effect, bringing mild floral and some moderate citrus flavors to the table. This beer finishes quite dry, though it manages to leave you with a second helping of honey and floral hops. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, although almost too light and dry. Combined with the intense carbonation, I get the feeling that I am drinking seltzer water at times, which seems to throw the beer off balance. Overall though, the only issues I had with drinkability was the selzter-like characteristic, and with the outstanding flavor, appearance and taste of this one, I'd say that SA Noble Pils is definitely worth purchasing again.","jsdunlop","Feb 10, 2011"

The flavor is odd; it has nice spice and bitter orange notes with subtle herbal underneath with some honey notes but similar cereal kills the nice notes.

It is light and is like a light honey lager. It kind of reminds me of a couple Dortmunders I've had, just a little lighter in color. It drinks pretty light but has a better feel than most.

3.97,5.6,3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a very clear, very crisp looking golden. A short-lived white bubbly head with very large bubbles diminished to a few patches of froth and a scant ring. A nicely floral aroma that gives a somewhat piney and lemongrassy scent, but also a good dose of biscuits. Flavors abound! More malty than last year's version, I enjoy the balance here. The hops are less pronounced, but much more balanced amongst one another. There is a nice blend of herbs, freshly cut grass, and pine with a big biscuity backbone. Rich and well carbonated. I would actually say this is the thicker end of a light body, almost reaching medium bodied on my scale. Highly, highly, HIGHLY drinkable. I feel like this year's Noble Pils is very well made.","DmanGTR","Jan 23, 2011"

Hoppy aroma right up front and it's rounded out by being kind of grainy with a zesty orange aroma to support the nose. Pilsner malts right up front on the pallet with grainy flavors and a bitter hop finish. Citrus flavors that I suspected in the aroma are kind of lost in the flavor. The body is light and refreshing with sharp carbonation. Overall, nothing offensive here and the flavors are pretty on point. Real nice interpretation to the style.","Bendurgin","Jan 23, 2011"

I feel like this has considerable hops, definitely in line with the style description, but is also very drinkable.

3.78,0.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours from the 22oz. bottle a rather macro-like pale yellow with a foamy white one finger head. Fairly high carbonation...I can see lots of bubbles in the bottle even before I begin to pour, and more macro-like fizz in the glass. Aroma is disappointingly light. There's a faint hint of citrus hops, but nothing like the blast I was expecting from the use of 5 different hop varieties. 1st sip brings a dose of dry, crisp citrus and herbal hop, with just enough sweet malt on the back end to provide a good balance. For lack of a better comparison, this reminds me of an amped-up version of Heineken or St. Pauli Girl. Mouthfeel is light, smooth, and crisp, with just enough heft to keep from being watery. Drinkability is very good! These would make a nice game day session beer. Overall, another winner from Jim Koch and Boston Beer Co.

Taste is very good and is true to the Bohemian pils style. It has a nice malty sweet backbone, is somewhat grassy, and the hops really come through in a fantastic and balanced way. The hops provide a bit of a bite on the finish of the beer, but I found it to be enjoyable. Drink is light and extremely sessionable.

The malt is there with that pilsner malt taste but I remember them saying they used to do something special to the malts in this beer but now they don't even mention it maybe because they didn't do it in this years version? I don't know. I'm also getting a slight alcohol taste and smell since there isn't that much to cover it up but the hops do the best job they can to mask it and they do to an extent. Definitely a good beer for the spring. If you want a hoppy Pilsner that is comparable to Victory's Prima Pils get this.","thebrood1987","Jan 05, 2011"

The hops immediately hit the palate, citrus notes, grassy. Finishes sharp and dry with somewhat bitter hops from start to finish. Mouthfeel is chalky and dry. I wish this beer was a little sweeter and more malty. The hops just overpower it and it never reaches it's potential and balance that I expect from this brewer. Not real drinkable for me.

Sweeter up front than I expect, then dry pepper and mild hops note. Finishes a touch metallic, but not outside of my impression of the style. Mouthfeel is surprisingly substantial and silky, not at all the typical pils. Nice carbonation. Drinkability is very good.

The smell is slight malt and heavy green vegetable matter, the name doesn't lie this is big on noble German hops. Taste is light, crisp, refreshing, malty sweetness excellently backed by the noble hop spicy vegetable flavours. Mouthfeel is a thin medium has more body than water which is spot on.

At first, the aroma carries very strong citrusy hop notes. Unfortunately, those give way to an odd, chemically, disinfectant presence very similar to what I noticed in BBC's Coastal Wheat. Taste is initially very good, with spicy, piney notes in the forefront, but again, there is a disturbing chemical presence lingering in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, with a rich, well carbonated character.

4.9,30.3,5,5,5,4,5,"The only thing lacking in this beer is the soft limestone water of the northern Germany and the Czech Republic, which is saying a lot as beer is mostly water. But despite that shortcoming, this is the best American pilsner. It is not a malt/hop bomb, like Prima Pils, which is a robust brew, but not a true pilsner. SA Noble Pils is ripe with hops, and has a solid malt body, but is more drinkable, "sessionable" than other boutique offerings. It is a mainstay and they should brew it year-round, as it dwarfs their other seasonal offerings.","sudz42","May 04, 2010"

The bitter hop profile is a little strong up front and creates a slightly grainy texture to the taste but the cirticesque fruits along with some mild sweet malts are evident and balanced.

It also had that typical Sam Adams taste that most if not all of their beers have in one way or another. I knew I was drinking a Sam Adams but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Average mouthfeel, wasn't expecting much in that department anyways. Lower ABV makes this really drinkable but that is not the only drinkable thing about it.

The taste starts off with a big hoppy blast (minty, spicy, floral), a maltiness that resembles bread dough, and a clean, dry finish. This is kind of a one trick pony, but it's a damn good trick.

If the brain trust at BBC wants to continue releasing this beer at the beginning of the year, I would suggest hopping the shit out of it. That way, it would provide a nice bracing bitterness for the early adopters (who are likely BA-types anyways), and the beer could melt into a pleasantly drinkable pilsner by April when the snow is...well, melting into slush.

Pours into the glass a bright, sunny, deep golden hue, topped with a lovely, rocky white head. Smells strongly of citrus, lemons and grapefruits mainly. On the palate, a slight breadiness is lifted up by the lemon spiciness.

I've only had it on draught and am afraid the bottle might disappoint, but if you can get it fresh this beer is sure to please. The malt backbone is solid. Perfectly balanced with a nice firm bitterness and, the best part is, the late addition flavor/aroma of those famed "noble" hops. Really rounds this beer off perfectly.

I drove 90 miles twice in one week to get more. i will drive it again, and buy as much as i can before it goes off season, which will be incredibly dissapointing. This is desert island beer, i could drink this and this alone every day if pushed. as far as mouthfeel, its average, but its a lager/pilsner, so its right in line with the style.","apwilla","Mar 18, 2010"

It's not for the novice dinker but for anyone who can appreciate a good beer that isn't too overly complex, there's no need to look any further.

The beer finishes crisp with a stronger bitterness, but still very light. The next sip seems sweeter due to the bitter finish.

Clean nose of pretzel dough, peppery spice, dried orange rinds and apricot and peach pits, very light corn element, vague molasses as it warms, nothing pushy about it at all, however, displays good staying power the same. Light-bodied with active carbonation, the orange to lemon citrus shows bite through the attack and matches the sourdough, multi-grain bread flavors nicely.

Golden, clear (not cloudy in the least) and pours a decent one inch head that dissipated quickly. Somewhat hoppy and fruity, definitely more flavour than most pils that I am accustomed to.

While very nice, the hopiness is a bit less present than what I was expecting. The mouthfeel is very crisp and enjoyable, although it could do with a bit less carbonation.

As could be gleaned from the nose, the taste is heavy on the hoppy bitterness, with a biting bit of citrus and not much maltiness to speak of.

The flavor does allow the malt to come through in a grainy, non-distinct fashion and the hops still dominate but not in a lingering bitterness way.

Nice crisp, refreshing, dry finish with just a subtle hint of bitterness. Hugely drinkable. I usually prefer the extremely bitter pilsners like Bitburger, but this was unique and was almost closer to a pale ale than a pils.

There is lots going on in this pilsner, but not all of it good. It is an interesting interpretation of the style, some nice hop flavors emerge, but the beer ventures into some odd territory and the candied hops are just a bit off for my tastes. The saltene dryness in the finish is okay and brings the beer back to its Germanic roots. The candied hop flavors are throwing this beer off for me.","albern","Feb 19, 2010"

Of course this is going to taste better and have more hop character than the mainstream "pilsners" but it has trouble competing with the likes of Prima Pils and even Penn Pilsner (full disclosure: drowning your sorrows in a Penn Pilsner at PNC Park on a nice night is, for my money, the ultimate pilsner experience).

Fruity (did I mention fruity?) hops in the nose and a nicely balanced initial taste, biscuity malt with a fruity then softly bitter hops flavor profile. Had it stayed there, I would have enjoyed it immensely. But the flavor quickly transitions to a slick, buttery diacetyl that borders on undrinkable. Sure there's some residual hops bitterness in the aftertaste, but after a few swallows I had to set it aside. Just didn't cut it. I'm hoping a bad batch; and I'll try it on tap to see if it's better.

This beer pours a crisp, golden hay that's so clear; when I hold it close to the computer monitor I can actually read the page behind it. The head a good 3inches and creamy white leaves behind pretty good lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is light pilsner malt relaying a sweet bready aroma, just a slight caramel and then a lemony brightness from the noble hops. Also at the very tail is a metallic aroma, almost medicinal as in smelling a bottle of aspirin. The taste is very similar. There is not much room to hide anything. A sweet bready pilsner malt works up the entirety of the profile. Just a hint of toffee. Lemon rind and a bit of spices from the hops. Here's the kicker. There is a massive medicinal flavor at the very end of the flavor profile. It reminds me of when you leave an aspirin tablet sitting on your tongue a little to long. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy for the style and it also lacks the stereotypical dryness that comes with so many of its German counterparts. I want to like this beer.

The flavor is moderately hoppy--slight amount of grass, bready/grainy malt flavors followed by a palate cleansing moderate hop bitterness that lingers just a bit. The carbonation is medium, as is the body. Overall a very well made Pils on the hoppier side of the style--worth a try.","uwmgdman","Feb 12, 2010"

I always thought that for all the great beer they brew, they were missing a good pale lager, and they really nailed it with this beer. They have recently released some brews that are somewhat pedestrian (fruity), as they seem to want to appeal to wider audience. That said, Mr. Koch does a good job of remembering what his roots are, and I glad to see them continue to brew traditional styles of beer such as this Noble Pils. Now, if only this were a year round offering, I would be set.","AustinBeerLvr","Feb 12, 2010"

I voted for this one at the Great Lakes BrewFest in Racine, WI back in September...glad this won...have bought a couple 6'ers of it since it's became available in my area.

Just of some hops and had a slightly sweet smell. And mild notes of citrus. Tasted of bitter hops and had a slight citrus taste. Also had a slight better aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth.

The aroma is appealing, with slight citrus and plenty of clean hop notes. The taste is a bit more complex than that of your typical pils, with each of the five noble hop varieties used (Hallertau, Tettnanger, Spalt, Saaz, & Hersbrucker) making their presence known. Crisp and clean on the palate, with plenty of carbonation. Very refreshing, just like a good pilsner should be. Not sure why this is their January to March seasonal; I'd think a brew like this would be more appropriate to warmer weather.

It's a very drinkable beer. The combination of a light body and no overwhelming flavors makes me think just about any beer drinker could down at least one bottle easily.

4.3,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bright clear, light yellow gold in the glass with a fine bubbled pure white head that laces a bit on the way down. The smell is clean aromatic and herbal hoppines. There is a light balance of pilsner malt but for the most part the smell is just very fresh hops, my first impression was of opening a bag of hops while homebrewing. The taste is a base of pale malts with nothing really assertive on the malt side as the real player is the hops. A full range of flavor from grasses to herbs to a bit of lemon and pepper is some of what you get. The mouthfeel too is good lively and light with a healthy level of carbonation that keeps things quite tingly the finish is clean and pretty dry with a lingering bitterness from the hops. Overall this is a really good offering. Personally I'm much happier with this than I was with the old spring seasonal the white ale. Not only is it a good Spring beer from Sam but a solid example of the german pils.","fank2788","Feb 06, 2010"

Taste follows nose; a slight cereal grain quality comes out in the mix, but very nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is light in body and in carbonation. I'm not a huge pilsener fan, but this one work for me.

I thought the taste was fantastic for this style. Definitely has grassy lemon notes as others have noted. The malty sweetness shows itself for a short time before being taken back over by a crisp and bitter finish that leaves a slight alfalfa sprout note.

A nice light hoppy beer that went very well with Mexican food, and had a nice hoppy taste throughout, but the one knock was that it was not extremely flavorful. The hops jumped out at initial contact and hit you in the nose, but then the beer just seems to taper off in a muted way until the dry finish. It's a decent beer that's above average, but just OK.

Spicy, earthy, grassy, and tart citrus flavors settle on the tongue, linger for a time, and slowly dissipate as the hop oils volatilize. This beer has a crisp, semi-dry mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation.

The smell was that of light malts (seemed similar to the Boston Lager) with some notes of grassy hops. The taste was very straightforward. It was very similar to the aroma. It was a crisp light malt flavor up front followed by some nice hops notes toward the middle to finish of the sip. Overall a nice session beer. I was not overly impressed but a great beer nonetheless. Nice to see these in 12-packs. I will probably pick up some more once it starts to warm up.","ugaterrapin","Jan 31, 2010"

The taste starts with your traditional pilsner hop profile and dried out hay and lightly toasted cereal grains. Then the middle has a supper grass and earth hop flavor.

The taste is pretty much the same with loads of damp, earthy, leafy hop characteristic and an underpinning of sulfur. There's a restrained citrus zest in there too. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, very refreshing with a nice carbonation. Overall, fans of pils should enjoy this one a lot. The noble hops are unmistakable and offer a pretty complex flavor profile.

Aroma was a little on the weak side for a pils, but then I like Pilsner Urquell, so maybe not. Taste was semi sweet with nice hop spiciness up front, and a long piney finish. The hoppiness, while being very much a part of this beer, was not overly aggressive. For those who find Pilsner Urquell or some of the German Pils' overly aggressive on hops, this would be a more approachable one. Very smooth, very drinkable. I would rate this right up there with some of Germany's better pils.","EricTheJew","Jan 29, 2010"

Now honestly I don't think Prima's malts are spot on for a German pils but the beer still works better for me as a pils versus this one. Again this is solid beer but in terms of pilsners I enjoy Prima and the usual PA and German suspects decidedly more.

Aroma is full of grains, pale malt and spicy noble hops. Flavor is great as far as pilseners go. The malt base is largely unsweet with a touch of honey and cereal, but mostly straight up pils malt which doesn't even try to get in the way of the hops. One of the hoppiest pilseners I've ever had, really vivid grassy and spicy character with a very faint unripe grapefruit/lemon citric note towards the end. It's got an appreciable bitterness that unfortunately comes paired with some astringency on the tongue. With a more inspired aroma and a crisper, cleaner finish, this could be world class. But as it is, it's just really good and a welcome addition to the mostly-mediocre Sam Adams line.","illidurit","Jan 26, 2010"

This is what a lot of American pilsners lack. It has that nice hit of bitter that keeps the beer clean and fresh. SUPER drinkible. This should really be an all-year offering from SA. Glad they chose to make this this style the new seasonal.","Liverpool08","Jan 24, 2010"

The aroma is pepper and spicy from the hops, there is dry cracker like malt scent. The taste has a citrus zest, some orange, honey and it seems like they added lime zest. This is followed by a grassy, peppery, overall spicy noble hop flavor which adds some dry bitterness in the end. The body is fairly light with moderate carbonation, starts sweet and finishes slightly bitter. A unique pils, not sure I am totally digging the lime citrus flavor in a pils but it is not cloying or artifical. It has good typical pils characteristics with the added lime like zest.","Gmann","Jan 23, 2010"

There are noticeable hops and malts in the aroma and they seem to balance each other out with the same level of strength. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The hops are more noted in the taste than in the aroma along with a bit of cereal grains and light malts. It ends dry. Complex but enjoyable.","puboflyons","Jan 22, 2010"

On the taste this brew has a extreme fresh flavor, the mouthfeel is full and rich with great body. Back to the taste, it is slightly bitter but sweet, not balanced but plentiful. The malts and hops are not merged but are both present. This is the best pils I have ever dranken, bar none.","mooseisloose","Jan 22, 2010"

The brew poured to lighter golden color with a good sized white head that had both good retention and lacing. The aroma is somewhat complicated as I am picking a number of hop scents, floral, herbal and a slight lemon citrus. The malts come through as well and mix very perfect with the hops and I wonder if that is why I am getting some earthiness from the aroma as well. The flavors, well I really did not think that they could live up to the aroma but they do and then some. A very fresh clean taste, hops give it a nice bite and what I perceive as a lemon zest. I notice the hops the most but they are in no way dominate as I am picking up nice bread and biscuit flavor which mix perfectly well. Nice carbonation on this one, perfect accompaniment to everything else that is going on. Drinkability on this one is through the roof as it goes down so easy. While I usually feel that the brews from Sam Adams are fair to good, heck they where a gateway to good beer years ago for me, this one is simply excellent and a complete surprise. I know that this is a "spring" beer but this would be the perfect session brew while sitting on the deck in summer.","Stimack","Jan 21, 2010"

Bread crust and saltine crackers are crisp on the palate thanks to a lively carbonation level, while the hops kick up some zest across the sides of the tongue. Floral, grassy, and green, with a semi-musty aftertaste of mineral-rich soil; packs a light body without feeling watered-down in the slightest. German pilseners don't get much better than this.

4.22,12.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12oz bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem, NH, imbibed out of the Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass. Pours a crystal-clear straw-yellow body with nearly an inch of off-white head comprised of large bubbles that dissipate rather quickly. Spicy herbal grassy hops come through right away in the aroma, with hints of toffee, biscuit, and butterscotch. Spicy noble hops share the flavor almost equally with bready malt with touches of DMS (cooked vegetable), toast, and butter. Very light bodied with ample (though not overwhelming) carbonation pair with the light body to aid the drinkability greatly. Not a bad pils. I've definitely had better examples of the style - to me this falls somewhere between the bohemian and Bavarian ends of the spectrum. But this grows on me, an easy drinking spring seasonal. Glad this replaced the White, and glad another widely available pilsener is out there.","MrHurmateeowish","Jan 13, 2010"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Tastes clean and fresh with sparkling hoppiness on warm, toasty malt bed. Hops are floral mainly, with secondary flavors of spicy, herbal, and citric. Soft fruitiness from aroma is present. Moderately stiff hop bitterness. Finishes with a kiss of hop. Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability.","MrHungryMonkey","Jan 13, 2010"
4.49,19.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"You want a small ABV beer with big flavor, one that's accessible and affordable and made (presumably) with love? Give Noble Pils a try. In fact, give it a few tries--buy it in a 6-pack and stretch it out over a week. That was the way I realized this was a truly great beer, having initially found it one-dimensional. It definitely is not, and I couldn't think of a better "every day" beer than this one.","Metalmonk","Jan 13, 2010"
4.28,13.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Overall - This will be a great beer when it's late spring and nice and warm outside, but by that time Summer Ale will probably be among us... meh.","mullenite","Jan 12, 2010"
4.57,21.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: Dangerously drinkable. A thirst quenching brew that makes me thirst for more with every sip. What happened to my 12-pack?? (kidding, I only had a 22;-)","markskar","Jan 12, 2010"
3.84,2.1,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This is a nice offering from Sam Adams. Not at the top of it's class in any one area, but taken as a whole everything works well together. A beer one could easily sit down and drink more than a few.","JBogan","Jan 12, 2010"
3.9,3.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"a very drinkable beer. poured light golden with a 1/2 inch, quickly disapating head. very earth-like, pilsner smell. great taste and even better aftertaste. easily one of my favorite sam adams offerings. definately recommended! im adding this sentence to meet the 250 character requirement. :(","realbama","Jan 12, 2010"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"drinkability: finally a nice lager that assecceable because we don't have Prima just yet in the market. Overall I prefer Prima but this a great beer. I'ts more balanced than Prima and has way less hops though","CampusCrew","Jan 11, 2010"
3.89,3.5,4.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Finally! A spring seasonal that is worth looking foward to! Sam Adams has really hit the spot with this one. It has been a while since I have had a pilsner and if I remember right they never tasted as good as this one did. After drinking heavy winter beers the last few months it took me until my second bottle to really appreciate the great flavors. Crisp hops and flavors of lime or is it lemon on touch the front of my mouth. And the color! After pouring it in a glass everyone will want it, so you may want to hide them from friends at first. After the snow melts I will defintely be looking foward to having a drink of this on the lawn and starting the bbq for the first time.","emetib0081","Jan 11, 2010"
4.88,29.8,5,4.5,5,5,5,"D- the best thing to come from BBC in a long time and perhaps my favorite offering from them EVER. if this exact recipe could be produced year round, it would be a dream come true and if any american brewery could kick the shit out of every german pils i've ever tasted, i could have guessed it would be sam adams. this stuff just begs to be consumed. this is one incredibly good and drinkable beer.","hustlesworth","Jan 11, 2010"

3.76,0,4,3,4,4,4,"A golden straw color pour with a two finger faomy white lasting head , good retention leaving jagged lacing down the glass ,medium carbonatin. Aroma is of a solid toasty malt background with a mixture of spicy hops , honey , caramel and biscut . Flavor is lightly sweet up front with hints of citrus and toasted malt grain , piny and spicy hops balance well with the malt backbone, mild bitterness with almost an earthy tone , fruity and spicy with a clean finish , a crisp clean mouthfeel , light body . I only bought one of these but I would deem it sessionable , I could see drinking several of these at one sitting , a smooth enjoyable beer , thanks Sam","WakeandBake","Jan 10, 2010"
4.57,21.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The body is a taut lightish medium with steadfast, non-uppity carbonation. Even on a frigid night, this rockets itself down the throat. This is far and away the best new seasonal Sam Adams has put out in a while, but early spring is a weird slot for this. It needs to be around (and fresh) in the warmer months, or better yet, year-round.","cokes","Jan 10, 2010"
3.6,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Flavor is light grain and bread, followed by some spicy floral hoppyness. Finish is clean and lightly bitter.","Padron4KM","Jan 09, 2010"
4.07,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"after a side by side comparison with Victory Prima Pils, I'll have to say that Victory still holds the crown for best US German-style pilsner, but Noble Pils definitely sits right up in the top 3 without a doubt.","tzieser","Jan 09, 2010"
4.35,15.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D- a very drinkable beer, over drinkable in fact the 6% ABV never lets itself known 'till you've had a few or 5, this is an incredible ger. pilsner from the boys at SA, i hope they put this one out all the time","animal69","Jan 09, 2010"
3.89,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Pretty solid atmosphere. Appearance is really average, but the nose is really full, floral, and unique. Very nice combo of tones. Flavor is not too complex, but bitter and sharp, with just a hint of spice and kind of a grassy tone to finish it. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff.","bmwats","Jan 08, 2010"
3.68,-2.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Edit - I had this on tap at Outback, the first round from the first keg of NP they had, and I noticed it had more sourness to it. I frankly think that it tasted better from the bottle, but that might have to with the keg being just tapped and the glass just pulled out of the fridge.","DesMoinesMike","Jan 08, 2010"
3.53,-6.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall a pretty good beer. As others have noted this one is more for a warm spring/summer day than the mid-winter. I'll most likely pick up a six pack once the weather turns nicer to enjoy as an everyday beer.","goldbot","Jan 08, 2010"
3.92,4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Golden straw body, nice off-white foamy head. Banana peel and grainy pilsner/munich malts in the nose with light citrus and floral hop notes. The taste has more banana peel, mild spices and a nice noble hop character in the back with a lemony, grassy finish. Mouthfeel is very refreshing, sparkling even and a definite German feel. Overall very well done, a Pilsner without the cheap malt flavor.","natelocc787","Jan 08, 2010"
3.46,-8,4,3,3,4,4.5,"Overall, a decent beer. My biggest gripe is in the flavor profile. Everything for a Pilsener is there, but it just comes off a tad weaker than I expect from a craft brewer. Definetly worth a shot, but don't expect one of the best Pilseners around.","OldSchoolGamer","Jan 07, 2010"
4.41,17.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Found this at my local Kroger. Was really suprised to see this brew so soon. Pours golden clear with a nice head. This is their best seasonal brew hands down. Very drinkable brew. SA does it again. Glad I bought 2 cases, and will buy more before they're gone.","OverToad","Jan 05, 2010"

3.58,-4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: I found this quite drinkable, but rather dull. It looks great, but the flavor seems too light, even for a light style like this. Seems like a nice candidate as a summer refresher, however. Perhaps my opinion would improve on a warm summer day vs the cold winter night I drank it on.","Rayek","Jan 01, 2010"
3.5,-6.9,4,4,3,4,3.5,"Conclusion: I picked up a 12-pack of this at Hyvee today as it was a great price (12 bucks) and it had nothing but rave reviews. I have to say, it's not quite what I expected. I don't love it. Nor do I hate it. I'm honestly not quite sure how I feel about it. The intense and herbal hoppiness is nice, but somehow (for me) the malt and hop flavors don't quite come together to make the light, crisp, clean Pilsener I was expecting. The hops aren't overpowering (I'm an IPA fan after all), but they just seem a bit rough to me, especially in a style that's generally so smooth.","BedetheVenerable","Dec 30, 2009"
4.43,17.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"D: After being on a huge DIPA/IPA kick lately, it's refreshing in so many ways that I could drop back to a beer that had just the right amount of hops to satisfy that craving, but not the heaviness or the boozy alcohol content that leave me burpy and tired.","Phormula","Dec 30, 2009"

4.72,25.5,4,4.5,5,4,5,"This beer pours a spun gold color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of spicy noble hops, moderate bitterness, and assertive bready malt. The taste is very refreshing. The hops are sharp, but the malt is strong enough to balance everything out. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is one of the best German Pilseners I've had the pleasure of tasting. This beer replacing Sam Adams White Ale as their spring seasonal has got to be one of the best things to happen to craft beer in the last decade. I will certainly be drinking this by the case load.","KarlHungus","Dec 29, 2009"
4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"EDIT: Over a year after this brew was originally released, I find myself continuing to come back to it. It really is a great session option that goes down easy. Really solid overall.","MrDanno96","Dec 27, 2009"

4.75,26.3,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is inspiring if you feel bored with the craft beer scene and how things have been driven toward rarity and high alcohol with insane doses of malts and hops then you need to reach for the Noble pils from Sam Adams to take you back to a flavor that made you fall in love with beer.","WVbeergeek","Dec 23, 2009"
