3.42,-0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The taste is heavily toasted bread, fermenting plums, hints of earth, chocolate, and burnt sugar. It starts off a little sweet up front with faint sourness and burnt bitterness. However, the finish is more interesting, lightly spicey-peppery with a quality of root beer mixed with burnt toast. It's mostyl rather bland but it does have a little complexity and is light and rather drinkable. It seems a pretty middle-of the road dunkel for me.","Offa","Apr 19, 2008"
3.1,-10.1,3,3,3,3,3.5,"From a 12 oz bottle this poured a chocolate brown with a small and quick fading light tan head and minimal lacing. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly smooth. Nose roasted malts, and some roasted nuts. Flavor is of burnt malts and some chocolate. Sweet finish.","rkuhnel","Apr 13, 2008"
3.48,0.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"drinkability is good. this is an easy going dunkel with good concentration and solid flavors, just a bit thin on the texture and body.","botham","Apr 10, 2008"
3.45,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Poured a dark brown with a little head that dropped quickly to a ring around the edge which left a little lacing. It had a hazy appearance which surprised me a little, I was expecting a dark beer but with clarity which this didn't have. It has a sweet malty smell with no hop aroma. The taste is sweet up front with some toffee notes carrying it through, finishing clean. This one is all malt, but it is good. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and a pleasure going down. I enjoyed this beer, a little too sweet and maybe too one-dimensional to really stand out, but interesting enough to be enjoyable.","Godot","Jan 24, 2008"
3.69,7,3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"My second dark lager of the evening....a murky brown lager that pour with ample carbonation, but somehow the head falls flat....disappointing. The nose is interesting...sort of a caramel and chocolate affair. Tastes almost like a weizenbock to me, with a soft mouthfeel and sweet caramel malt and toffee flavors. The bitterness is restrained, but a tart, mineral-laden finish is sort of interesting. This lager comes across fairly hearty for its four percent alcohol and it's fruity character (buried underneath the caramel malt) almost has thinking of British Mild. Overall, this is a lager that drinks more like an ale; it gets better as it warms up, fruitier and more tart. I would like to experience this beer on tap.","marcobrau","Jan 15, 2008"
3.18,-7.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"12 oz. brown longneck with no freshness date. It pours a lightly-hazed mahogany with medium carbonation, topped with an inch of khaki head that leaves light lacing. The aroma consists of caramel, lightly roasted, and dark malts backed by an almost cloying sweetness, to which the flavor adds lightly citric hops that contribute a mild bitterness on top of a light, tingly body that imparts a medium finish. Overall not too bad, but it's lacking a certain something - glad to try it but I probably wouldn't revisit.","mmmbeer","Dec 29, 2007"
3.42,-0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a rather quiet deep mahogany with scant tan head and similarly whimpy lace. The aroma captures a fairly typical molasses/brown sugar malt quality, fairly strong with a touch of grassy highlight. The first taste brings a mildly carbonated brown sugar with a bit of bitterness, almost a bit flat as suggested by the lack of foam and lace. There is some grapefruit hidden in here as well. As you go along I think it grows on you and shows some complexity. I'd like to see more wholesome carbonation but the flavor appeals to me, quite sweet. This is easy enough to drink but I don't think it would stand up to drinking more than a couple, needs a little more body or something, but not bad.","Durge","Dec 16, 2007"
3.21,-7,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Not a bad dunkel, but no real "excitement". However, a good session beer given the ABV and middle of the road character.","sraimondi","Nov 04, 2007"
3.38,-2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - A pretty smooth beer overall. It is a pleasant lager, but it isn't worth hunting down.","mrasskicktastic","Oct 13, 2007"
3.67,6.4,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep brown with almost zero tan headskie. Sweet chewy nose well balanced. Goes down very smooth and is quite easy to drink. If it were just a touch less sweet I could drink it all night. A very decent dark lager. Quite surprised to run into this one, but I'm glad I picked it up.","scottum","Beers"
3.06,-11.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Klaster Dark Beer pours a dark mahogany brown with a light brown head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mildly sweet. The taste is pretty much one note, mildly sweet caramel flavor, and maybe just a touch nutty toward the end. I would expect a more malty flavor from a beer this color. The mouthfeel seems a bit thin too. Not bad, but not really good either. I'd just like this beer to taste like more of something, anything.","Drew966","0"
3.42,-0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Never have a problem with Czech beers anytime. Good dark brown, no lingering head. A whiff of licorice aroma. Medium or less mouthfeel, quite drinkable with active carbonation. Good taste,with chocolate malt, competitive with English browns, with this sessionable ABV.","Sammy","Mar 15, 2007"
3.75,8.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D-This is a nice session lager and the sweetness provided by the malt provides a nice counterweight to typical lagers.","sleazo","Feb 16, 2007"
3.2,-7.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"12 oz. bottle- color of dark brown , with a minimal white color head  sweet nose is malty , milk chocolate , dried bananas , and a hint of red berries  taste of malty , sweet dark milk chocolate and vanilla - body silky , and light  aftertaste of dark milk chocolate , malt , and sweet/ sour","stephendr","Feb 05, 2007"
3.16,-8.4,4,3,3,4,3,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a brown color with a deep ruby hue and a two-finger, pillowy, cream colored head. The smell is sweet of malt, amber and slightly toasted biscuits. The taste is also quite sweet, with too little bittering hops to balance. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a creamy carbonation. This beer would be more drinkable if it wasn't so sweet. Not a terrible beer, but not very impressive either.","gmfessen","Jan 10, 2007"

The smell is sweet and there is caramel in the smell as well as taste. The beer is smooth. This is a nice brown beer that I could drink again sometime.","Enola","Oct 09, 2006"
4.65,34.8,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"This was one of those beers I bought on a whim. Never heard of it, but I am slowly learning about Munich Dunkels. I am now hooked on this beer. I will definately be looking for it in the future.","guinnessfan","Sep 23, 2006"

4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Not an overwhelming heavy brew, but a good cooler day sipper. It has a creamy finish and.... I think I will have another. Great beer fo a couple, but not too many. Lighter alcohol feel and taste could probably get you later on if you push it. A great beer to try","katdaddy210","Jul 12, 2006"
3.35,-2.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Deep chestnut colored beer. Slight head and some nice lacing. Low aroma-sort of a mellow metallic smell to it. Slightly roasted with a very slight caramel like sweetness. Same traits of the aroma are in the flavor though more amplified. Somewhat nutty tasting. Lingering sweetness in the finish. Decent mouthfeel for only 4%. Not a bad beer-almost too sweet for me for a dunkel. Dry it out a bit it could be a killer beer-especially for a hot day when you want something darker.","lackenhauser","Mar 02, 2006"

4.1,18.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"nice mouthfeel with good carbonation and at 4% I could drink these all night. This one is slightly past its prime, but still good - I have had fresher examples in the past that were even better.

3.55,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle. Klaister Dark Beer has a very dark brown color with a small head. Malty cookie dough aroma and faint hops. The flavor is sort of dopplebock like. Rich, chewy malts. Lighty hopped. Some chocolate notes. Just a little bit fruity. There's a weird flavor that's like bubblegum. The flavor is a little too sweet, but not cloying. Medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is average. I enjoyed my bottle, but I doubt I'd want another. This is a decent beer, but I prefer their pilsner.","beveragecaptain","Nov 15, 2005"

3.57,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Klaster Dark Beer is a passable Czech version of a Munich dunkel lager, but that's as far as I'm willing to go. I've had good versions of the style, so I know they exist. Unfortunately, this one can't be counted among them.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 02, 2005"
3.62,4.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown nearing on black with a short tan head. Smells of bitter coffee and malts, with some dark fruit. Taste has the bitter coffee, then strange dark fruits reminding me of Black Boss porter, and ending with an apple cider sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but smooth. Overall an alright drinker, lots of flavors, but they don't always jive. Worth a try though","Golden2wenty1","Jun 19, 2005"
3.13,-9.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Smell was mild malt and a hint of coffee? Taste was pretty much what the nose gave hints of. Mild finish after a thin but not watery mouthfeel. Overall a good experience if not special.","BrewMaven","Jun 05, 2005"

3.26,-5.5,2.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Pours out with a little head which turns into absolutely nothing. Beer looks flat as hell with no lacing at all. Color is a dark brownish red. Has a somewhat pleasant bready, vanilla like smell to it. Smells better than it looks to be sure! Tastes quite sweet initially, then turning somewhat salty with a doughy maltiness. Cannot pick out much hoppiness. Mouthfeel is of little carbonation bubbles on the tongue. I suppose with such low abv this could be a session beer but with so many better choices out there why would you?","Star80","Apr 14, 2005"

3.48,0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A good session beer. Pours a slightly red tinged brown. No head whatsoever. Slight carbonation. The aroma is very, very mild malts and hops. Nothing else of note really. The taste is pretty sweet with malt, toffee and molasses. It reminds me of the breads my mom makes during the holidays. Mouthfeel is pretty full, but finishes watered down. Still this makes a great beer to sit down with a six-pack and watch games all afternoon.","MuddyFeet","0"

4.36,26.4,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark ruby color with a smallish head that drops to a film and leaves no lace. Smell is sweetish, roasted malt, caramel, smoke, grass, fruit, hops and toffee. Taste is similar with roasted malt, hops, toffee, caramel, sweet fruit and a hint of some smokiness. Great complexity and balance. Mouthfeel is a nice balance between the hoppy lager bite and sweetness from the roasted malt. Medium/full body for a lager. Nice effervescence all over the mouth and tongue. Warms the throat slightly. Aftertaste is a bit light, though. Drinkability is vey high, would recommend this brew to anyone.","PorterLambic","Sep 20, 2004"
2.87,-16.8,2.5,3,3,2,3,"Pours a reddish brown color with a this fizzy head it looked like pop,highly carbonated and fizzy.Picked up mainly caramel malt in the aroma along with some light roasted nuttiness.Man the mouthfeel is like pop as well sharp on the tongue and pretty thin.Taste of sweet caramel and roasted grain with even some soapiness in there late.Wow really let down by this beer I really like the Klaster lager and Winter lager but this falls way way short of those two,I'll stick with them.","oberon","Sep 07, 2004"

There are slight roasted malt aromas in the nose. This is quite a sweet beer, and is fairly light bodied as well. The sweetness reminds me of a lactose stout. This is not very roasted tasting. The predominant taste impression is one of sweetness.","Gueuzedude","Nov 26, 2003"
3.32,-3.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a nice red black color, but lacks head. Smell is pleasing, hoppy and fresh, if it is possible for a beer to smell fresh.

Better than average but not great.","RocketWidget","Aug 09, 2003"
