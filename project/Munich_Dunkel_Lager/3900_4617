4.25,13.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"KLD (Konig Ludwig Dunkel is just too much to type...) is typical of dark wheat beer, but certainly better than most in all respects. It's taste hints of caramel, molasses and honey but neither flavor is overpowering, nor do they detract from KLD's surprisingly easy drinkability. I first tried it in the tourist town of Rudisheim on the Rhine river. I was immediately impressed with the beer's taste - far and away the best dunkelweiss I have ever had - but was later even more impressed at how un-filling and light KLD was for a typically heavy style of beer. I'm sure the calorie count doesn't reflect this, however, even if they do go down like a domestic light.","Theicon44","Aug 10, 2010"

This beer is a very addictive one you drink it get the bitterness the wetness then it dries out and you just want more and keep drinking it I always have to put just one or two in the fridge at a time or else it all disappears. The only downfall is it is only available in my region ounce a year on tap and is like searching for a needle in the haystack to find it bottled.

Still very good, sweet start and bitter finish, not bad for the style. Cheers to my friend Heinz from Munich for bringing it all the way across the pond.","StevieW","0"
