Lots of stick lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of sugary roasted malts with a hint of cocoa and caramel. Pretty much the same for the taste with some molasses as well as some dark fruit in the mix. Very tasty and smooth brew. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation which isn't too much for this great German brew (World's Oldest Monastery from 1050 AD). Overall, really like this one.","BeerWithMike","Dec 05, 2014"

This poured a very alluring ruby colour, with a big fluffy tan head and lots and lots of carbonation - which I wondered if it had anything to do with the glass, as there were streams of bubbles coming up from the pattern on the glass bottom. At first the nose worried me as it bore a resemblance to the detergenty smell but eventually it gave way to a predominantly ginger spiciness.

This time I really noticed the deep coca cola colour and the creamy and persistent head. It's a beautiful beer to look at and the malty aroma wafting from the top continued to the end. The flavour is a complex malange of dark chocolate, coffee-mocha with some molasses and just a hint of bitterness at the end to prevent cloying. You could have this with a chocolate mousse or creme brulee or just by itself for a nice dessert. Its not quite a full bodied beer despite appearances and can seem watery after a fuller beer but it stands up as a well balanced and very complex dessert beer. I think you could only have one or two before becoming palate fatigued so it's not exactly a BBQ quaffer. It is a fabulous drop all the same.","rjimlad","May 07, 2007"
