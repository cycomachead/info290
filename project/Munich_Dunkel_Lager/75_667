3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A respectable, decent tasting brew. I generally find it offered at most Mexican restaurants and becomes my go-to brew for such occasions. It offers enough roasted grain character and warmth with a complementary hop bitterness to make it stand out over most commonly offered Mexican brewery offerings.","beergoot","Mar 31, 2015"

3.34,0.3,3.25,3,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pours a dark,brown, clear color with a very small foamy head from a tap.  Head retention and lacing are minimal at best.  Dark malty aroma.  Hints of nuts and caramel (maybe).  Slightly sweet taste with heavier malts, nutty and slight caramel.  Not much of a hoppy bitterness.  It is a good beer to try if you are looking to go from crap to craft, but not a beer craft lovers would consistently buy.  Maybe as a cheaper beer to bring to parties instead of the mass produced adjuvant lagers.","jngrizzaffi","Mar 30, 2015"

3.94,18.3,4,3,4.25,4.25,4.25,"The closer to light, the redder, the further from light, the browner. Transparent for the color. Light gray-brown head which quickly turns to a film, lasts awhile longer before completely disappearing. Smell is nutty and sweet. Also it is just barely estery. Judging from this it is perhaps a little old, but still tastes the same as always to me; good; very much of caramel and malt, faintly woody, chocolatey, alcoholic and perhaps a hint of black cherry (I'm serious, took me a while to figure out what it was). Mildly bitter throughout. Well balanced, highly carbonated, medium to full bodied. Lightly coats the teeth. Finish is at first wet and then warming. As refreshing as a pilsner, as comforting as an ale.","Libeertarian","Mar 25, 2015"

I got this at my local Tex Mex joint, craving a change from the Dos Equis I usually drink while I'm there.  I wasn't expecting too much from this, especially given the reviews here, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a nice, sultry bronze color with a small, fleeting head.  The aroma is muted, but I definitely detect a rich maltiness.  The taste was actually more complex than I figured it to be, and there's a definite bite of alcohol that hits you with the carbonation on the tongue.  When compared to other Mexican beers, this is definitely at the front of the line.  Overall, not bad!  I'd certainly get it again.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Jan 16, 2015"

3.77,13.2,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"EDIT: Having one in the privacy of my own home right now.  I notice now that the smell has a bit of an almost coffee-like roastiness to it, which occasionally shows up in the taste just a bit (blending in with the "dark bread" sort of flavor, mostly.)  I'm finding that I really like the mouthfeel on this one when drinking some when it still has a bit of the foam on top, but it becomes a bit less smooth afterward.  Also finding that the color of this beer and how clear it is makes it look *really* nice when you've got decent lighting.  Fiddled with reviews just a bit to reflect my thoughts... guessing the score probably went up just a tad.","Pantalones","Dec 11, 2014"

The flavors are easy to pull out and are not too over the top. Fine beer. It's simple. But that more my problem with the beer rather than that making the beer bad.","ThomasMetal75","Nov 23, 2014"

To the taste there is caramel, some toffee, toast and sweet malts. Does some different things to differentiate itself as a lager and I liked that. Decent stuff.","BrewChatKen","Oct 29, 2014"

3.84,15.3,,,,,,"Overall (3.84) : I would certainly have this again. I'm not going to rush out and buy a pallet of it, but if someone offered it to me I'd gladly drink it. It has a great yeasty body with nice fruity notes and heavy bread crust at the end. I like the bread and the yeast. A yeast/wheat flavor remains on the palate long after the swallow. A decent beer, worthy of a taste.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 18, 2014"

Modelo Especial is more pleasing in taste and more refreshing. The dark lager flavors of caramel-dark bread are present for a few minutes, then just dilute and turn metallic, sour and bitter. Best paired with Mexican food if you had to drink.","shacawgo24","May 04, 2014"

3.44,3.3,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"First off, there is absolutely no good reason to put a lime wedge into a darker lager beer. For the purpose of this review enjoyed a bottle at a Mexican restaurant after said lime was extracted from the bottle neck. This is my favorite widely available beer down in Mexico and I will drink it here too should the occasion arise (Bavaria is another really good dark Mexican lager albeit harder to find at restaurants and bars). This brew is light brown, looking like iced tea or watery cola, with a decent amount of off-white to light tan head that will keep its shape for a bit provided you don't kill it off with lime juice. This beer is also served ice-cold pretty much anywhere you order it ... The initially weak aroma and flavors will develop if the beer is allowed to warm up a bit. Nose and palate jive quite nicely, amber and dark malts providing a mellow brown sugar backdrop with hints of raisin and roasted barley, along with vanilla-esque floral notes and some hops that recall sweet hay. The beer is highly carbonated and quite thin as one might expect, but well worth the attention that you probably wouldn't pay to a Corona or Sol. Malt forward but not aggressive and the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. Less bold than other Munich Dunkels I've had and I think this is better classfied as a Graf-style Vienna lager. The aforementioned Bavaria is a Munich dunkel. But hey.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 16, 2013"

Aroma is hops, caramel, and a bit of malt. Flavor is hops, malt, caramel, mild but balanced, and tipping a bit more to the hops side, which I enjoy. Mouthfeel is a bit foamy. Overall this is a good brown lager, but I really prefer ales--porters, stouts and IPAs.","Dsimenson","Nov 13, 2013"

Smells of caramel and a hint of butterscotch with a faint grainy almost bready malt in the background. Very light floral hop aroma. The flavor is mostly caramel, but it tastes fake. Moderate sweet maltiness is offset with a burnt butterscotch and faint spicy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. Vienna lager is quite a stretch here, dark adjunct lager fits better in my mind. Nothing horrible here, but the artificial taste and lack of complexity kills this one for me.","johnnnniee","May 10, 2013"

Pours a russet amber with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly to a thin film and ring around the glass leaving light lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, spicy graininess. Flavor starts well, with sweet mild toasted malt, slight breadiness, hint of caramel, but ends rather abruptly with slight caramel malt and a hint of grassy hops. Light bodied. A step above other macros, but nothing exciting. Would do in a pinch if only macro beer was available.","LiquidAmber","Mar 10, 2013"

The head was thin, but strangely, the lacing was noticeable all the way down the bottle - I've never seen anything like it. The smell was the normal hops and barley, but the odor was just slight - just the right amount in my opinion. Mouthfeel was surprising, the dark liquid was thick and felt velvety. The taste is what I walked away with impressed - full and rich - certainly not what I was expecting, but glad I did.

The retention of the collar was ok but there was only modest lacing. The aroma was of toasted malt, light bready notes and some dry grains. Much better than any other beer I found in Mexico and it was a welcome change already. The flavors were similarly refreshing. I tasted the bready malt, a hint of nuts, toasted grains and a clean, dry finish. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation medium. Of the widely available Mexican beers this was by far the best and it was a great way to finish my vacation.","thekevlarkid","Feb 20, 2012"

Poured amber with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly (after the head thawed out of course). The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, dark chocolate, wheat, and roasted malt. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Really nothing on this one stood out to me at all. I did like how this one had a bit of dark chocolate in it to add some character, but the wheat flavor I got here just didn't impress me at all. Got this as it was ranked as one of the best Mexican brews on the menu according to BA, but I guess I should have gone with a strawberry Margarita like caSSino chose to do...","thagr81us","Jan 19, 2012"

It tastes much like adjunct-type lagers though it does have a touch of bitterness. I wouldn't call it a hoppy taste, as there is no hint of floral flavors. Smell is not particularly pleasant, more like beer soaked into a beer mat. Aftertaste is kind of dirty and a little sour, like it has a touch of burnt malt.

Smell is of toasted malt and grains. Taste is of toasted malt, grains, and slight caramel. There is a very slight roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a pretty good level of carbonation.

3.44,3.3,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Thin, less than half finger, head of loose larger bubbles, wastes little time all but totally evaporating, insufficient foam to leave much lacing behind, no stickiness. Deep brown hued liquid, however, crystal clear and transparent, mixes in light orange rust to yellow nearer the glass bottom. The nose is gentle and engaging, featuring caramel, toffee and corn syrup notes, honey and challah bread, brush of orange citrus and white pit fruit, low but noticeable toastiness, the hops kick it in a little late but stiffen the texture before it all dissolves. Medium-bodied, the carbonation a bit excessive for the level of body and flavor but does help on the refreshing scale. More of an orange to lime citrus presence as well as flowers and scrub grass, still there’s little debating that the caramel, malt, butterscotch and danish flakes remain in the driver’s seat. Any nuttiness weaves in and out, inconsistent. Apple, grape and apricot fruit flavors stay in the background. By the finish the carbonation weakens enough to create a smoother mouth feel. Earns its place as one of the more credible Mexican beers generally available.","farrago","Jul 26, 2011"

I am having a difficult time buying into this being one of the top rated beers of the style. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching creaminess with a pleasant sweetness on the tongue.

At first the taste has a citris water quality like corona but the toasted malts try to sneak in at the finish but just can't get thier act together. The aftertaste has a little bit of toasty chocolate to it but it's very weak. Best described as Corona blended with some Bockbier. In the mouth it's kind of fizzy and watery, a little bit like soda. I don't think this is really true to the style but a style of it's own, Mexican Dark Lager perhaps, really quite refreshing and light, with a tropical feel to it.

The nose is weak, comprising light caramel, light biscuits, and very light florals. The taste is very similar, with the light caramel, biscuits, and florals returning, though with a bit o' hard water thrown in there, mixing things up in a slightly negative way.

Mild bitterness, a bit spicy and herbal, with caramel and toasted malt flavours. Faint fruitiness that was more of an indistinct dried fruit rather than fresh and juicy.

I don't get much hop character, but I do definitely get some dark fruits...maybe some prunes and raisins. Quite tasty. The mouthfeel is nothing impressive.

There is some floral character but really not enough to redeem this one. The flavor bounces my confidence in this beer back a up a bit. The beer is sweet, it's too sweet and for that matter it's too corny. But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of nice things going on in the flavor of this beer there is a good fruitiness with a nice interplay of just the mildest toasty malt. This is all before I mention that this has a really pleasant hop zing, I'm really not sure what the hops are but they strike me as west coast fruity and citrusy hops, however there is no denying the presence of some noble herbal hoppiness as well. The thing about Negra Modelo is that it does, basically, exactly what it came to do. It is slightly sweeter than most pale mexican lagers, at the same time it's got a more bold flavor than those as well, but at the end of the day it's refreshing. I am positive that this is what the brewers of this beer were going for, like it or not, they hit the mark.","BieresDesMoines","May 11, 2010"

The one inch, loose, off-white head sizzled and receded into a soapy cap. Nose is very subdued - malt, perhaps some dark fruit undertones, light banana esters and a hint of noble hops. Taste follows nose - nice balance between malt and bitter keeps the flavor profile on an even keel. A little watery and finishes with a little bit of cereal grain sweetness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even background carbonation and a semi-dry finish. All and all, not a bad brew and a nice complement to a Mexican dish.","Jwale73","May 08, 2010"

Definitely tastes very grainy, sweet like graham crackers. Chocolate comes through a bit, and there is a sort of metallic twang too. Not as carbonated as I was expecting, and fairly light in body.

This was the only beer we could find down there that wasn't like Tecate of Corona. Very smooth and tasty. The color is a dark amber and the beer poured great into a glass from both bottles and from the tap. Of course once we got back to the states I realized that most of the grocery stores around here carry this beer, perhaps I never noticed it before.

A bit malty on the tongue, it tastes just like most easy drinking lagers.

3.63,9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I recall first having this beer at Xiaolong's place when I was back in Cali; one of them in the house brought back a bottle from the company which orders that beer as a staple.. Back then I was not yet into beers and the only craft beer I have ever had then was Widmer's Hefe. When I tasted the Negra Modelo I was actually quite impressed. I was sure that was a mark above most macros and it sure was. I also recall that back then I felt that the bottle looks pretty different and was attractive with the gold foil and gold yellow label. Since my venture into beers, I have been trying to get this beer again but to no avail till I went on a trip to Hong Kong. I saw and instanteneously bought a bottle of the Negra Modelo from the shopping center in Times Square over at Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. I placed it in my check in luggage and successfully brought it back to Singapore together with a Sierra Nevada Stout. Back to the Negra Modelo, I served it in my Sam Adams globe pint glass and it pours out red brown with a 1 inch thick head that quicky recedes to a thin and clinging layer of creamy head. The smell was mainly malts and some hops aroma. The malts exuded a slightly burnt smell. The taste was mainly malts as well and slightly hoppy at the back. A very slight burnt maltiness gives it a dark lager kind of taste though not exactly.. But not as exciting as I was hoping it would be. Some hops following the strong malts and a dry finish follows. The after taste was again a flood of rich dark malts with a light citrus backing. Mouthfeel on this one is medium bodied with a creaminess to it that sets it apart from the macros. Smoothness was definitely there on this one. The carbonation starts off overly strong but as it warms, carbonation drops considerably. This beer is better when it was colder; do not let it sit around too long like I did.","basica","Dec 18, 2007"

The aroma is not too strong but I can pick up malt and chocolate along with some grassy bread characteristics. Most of these same qualities remain in the flavor with more of a leaning toward the grassy side. This one was not very well carbonated and overall a bit watery.

Even though it is dark in color the taste is light with mild carbonation. The malt flavors are what I notice, slightly toasty. No real hop flavors present but the brew does seem to be in good balance. Normally when at home I do not drink Mexican brews but this is one of my favorites when going to a Mexican restaurant. While in Mexico sitting on our balcony on a sunny morning, watching the ocean and listening to the waves hitting the beach all seems good. Guess I am saying that this brew has its time and place.

There a tiny bit of yeast, spice, and just the faintest hint of a chocolate like taste lurking way in the back.

Odd, a late sour numbing effect, not quite the same as one would get from a high alcohol brew. It's an herbal thing, a bit funky, not altogether pleasant. Can't put my finger on where this might come from. I decide it's a characteristic of the malt flavors, dark and musty. It has a short finsh, rather dry and a decent mouthfeel.

A Vienna beer isn't huge, but I would have liked to have had a bit more of the malt presence that there was here without the dark caramel flavors.

The beer has a light herbal character and a certain light astringent bitterness in the finish. This beer is fairly simple and subtle, but that is pretty characteristic of this style of beer.

What I liked about this beer is that it had quite a bit of flavor. It had a great malt character: sweet, nutty, and caramelly.

The nose suggests a semi-sweet and mildly fruit-tinged, lightly toasted malt. Very clean. The body is light/medium with a fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly zesty on the tongue. The flavor is reminiscent of a Vienna lager, but lighter and drier, and displays a well-balanced, lightly toasted malt with a hint of fruit and spice. It finishes dry with a light touch of caramel, a hint of spice, and an underlying hoppiness. Really well done, with alot of finesse. This, however, is a beer that needs to be enjoyed fresh.

3.48,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Went to a Mexican Restaurant today for lunch. It was a "proper" one said my work colleague, because it had Mexican beer. He told me I would enjoy it. He proceeded to babble in Spanish before we even sat down and a glass of dark beer arrived right on que. It's looks so reminded me of an atoned version of the dark spicy beer on sale at the U Fleku in Prague, probably the handled Pint Glass, a good start then. But it did look very good, and had a deep brown head. It was a very, very dark brown beer, not quite black on examination. Not much aroma though, probably due to the low temperaure at which it was served (frosted glass - I hate that!!). But oh, so smooth, really smooth, with a better mouthfeel than most dark beers, but yet at the same time it tasted and drank light, weird. Malty start, Chocolate mid-taste and a short mild-bitterness in the finish. Some caramel as it warmed. It went exceptionally well with the spicy food, and I for one will try it again - albeit a bit warmer next though.","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 03, 2002"
3,-9.9,3,3,3,3,3,"The first time I had "Negra Modelo", was my first trip to Warez, which was my first weekend at "Fort Bliss", in El Paso Texas. I liked it then, and I still like it, while my taste has changed more often than "Venom will change diapers the next few years", it still is a semi-regular in my "DBF". Deep garnet in color, the head is light chocolate, but dissipates a bit quickly, the lace is adequate. Nose is malt, light hints of caramel. The front is sweet, the top is light, the finish is moderately carbonated, dry, lightly hopped, but a very drinkable beer, and it does go good with the spicy food in the country of origin, and I don't mean that "Olde Gringo" stuff. Ranks #907 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Gusler","Oct 01, 2002"
3.97,19.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"ten times the beer that corona ever will be. i have a new respect for mexican beer after this one. a fine dark that went down great and was just what i wanted. not too heavy at all as it had a fine little hint of roastiness in the backround.","ElGuapo","Sep 29, 2002"
3.83,15,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"One of my favorite mexican beers.  Pours an attractive copper color with a moderate tan head. Sort of a fresh bread smell.  The taste is dry breadlike with a cedary peppery flavor.  Not too strong but fairly enjoyable. A moderate mouthfeel.  Available at most Mexican restaurants and usually the best one there.","fattyre","Sep 21, 2002"
3.06,-8.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Clear brown in appearance with very little head. Not an overly complex beer but the balance of malts and hops is good. For a dark beer I was disappointed that there wasn't more flavors.","Reverand","Aug 23, 2002"
3.11,-6.6,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"This is a decent Mexican beer.  It doesn't blow you with complex and fascinating flavors, but it doesn't need a lime to be tolerable (like some other Mexican brews).  It has a nice malty flavor with a little bit of hoppiness.  Goes well the Mexican food it is probably almost always accompaning.  An enjoyable brew,  I probably wouldn't buy it to take home (maybe if my wife is making her enchiladas) but It's one of the two or three I'll have at Mexican restaurants.  I also love the the marking on the label calling it an OK + Dark Ale.  Except the ale part that is a perfect description.","JeffreyG","Aug 19, 2002"
3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Deep copper red color with a modest off-white head, fades to a thin layer, thick lace coats the glass.  Good carbonation, lots of fine bubbles rise slowly to the surface.  Aroma is rich and malty with understated hops.  Mouthfeel is good, with only a modest sting from the carbonation.  Taste begins with mild roasted malts, bitter, though not overpowering, hops soon come into play, finish is a bit dry.  A decent, competent brew.","Pegasus","Aug 18, 2002"
3.36,0.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"If you are at a Mexican restaurant, please get this instead of Corona. Coppery colored and not very hearty for a darker beer but I can't complain too much, as it went great with my enchiladas.","Dogbrick","Aug 05, 2002"

3.03,-9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Dark amber body, with a big bubbly head.  Decent head retention.  Not much aroma, slightly malty with a bit of hop spiciness.  Caramel malt flavor is very mild, but increases as the beer warms.  Good offset to Mexican food heavily laced with Cholula, but that's about it.  Too heavily carbonated, but tolerable.","Viking","Jul 08, 2002"
3.06,-8.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Negra Modelo is a moderately above-average lager disguised as a good beer. Sure, its got a little malt sweetness and a discernible hop finish, even an aroma one might describe as toasty if they had never smelled roasted sweet corn. Nevertheless, a beer of this mahogany shade is expected to deliver more to the buds. Clearing the way for your next bite of chile rellenos is it's crowning achievement.","inebrius","Jul 02, 2002"

2.31,-30.6,3.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"Pours a dark caramel color and has a 1 1/2 finger head that fades rather quickly.  The smell is a that of a sweet malty beer.  Has a distinct but not harsh bite that fades quickly with each swallow.  The hops are noticeable but quickly disappear.  I searched the flavor with each swallow but it's gone so quickly the only thing I get out of it is a mild musty sweetness that lingers.  I can't tell much else about it.  It goes down nicely although it doesn't leave you desiring more, you just don't care.  Not bad, but definetely not great.  Perhaps a decent Mexican import, but lacks alot in comparison to most imports.","BeerAngel","Jun 25, 2002"
3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Interesting.  While I only had one of these imports, it smmes like a pretty solid brew.  The beer pours a nice dark color with a slightly light head.  The tast is a bit harsh at the first sip, but gets better as you go.  Perhaps not the best brew from south of the border, but definately worth a try.","goindownsouth","Jun 24, 2002"
3.03,-9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Though not a fan of mexican beers this one isn't so bad.  Sort of funny to see a mexican dark lager.  But from what I understand its actually a german recipe that they didn't screw up in Mexico.  Most mexican restaurants in my area have this brew, so it beats the alternatives of Corona or our mass produced crap...................CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 24, 2002"
3.83,15,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Reddish brown with moderate head and moderate carbonation. Roasted malt character reminiscent of caramel or nuts.  Warms as it finishes and has a mouth coating mouthfeel.","psugrad98","Jun 17, 2002"
3.8,14.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Mexican beer has never really been my bag.  Modelo's ability to maket something as tasteless as Corona continues to surprise me, to say the least.  That said I wasn't expecting much out of the Negra.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  It's short fat bottle is pretty cool,  but the rich smooth taste is what I liked.  This beer hits the tounge with a bit of creamy taste, then a mild hoppy bite rings through.  It finishes a bit dry and very clean.  Makes me want another.","InandOutBeerGuys","Jun 07, 2002"
3.41,2.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Negra Modelo:  This is the only beer I’ll order in a Mexican restaurant.  It is a brown lager that is very drinkable, and goes very well with hot foods.  Nice sweetness, with a hop bite.  Very good.","jackndan","May 27, 2002"
3.63,9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I tend to order this one when I go to a Mexian restaurant I frequent called Talita's.  I have had always been careful about these type of beers, but I found this to be quite drinkable.","Wildman","May 24, 2002"
4,20.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"A great Mexican-made Vienna lager. This particular beer has a medium brown color, a good deal darker than most Vienna lagers. It has a good malt aroma with a dry malt flavor and aftertaste. A good effort by grupo modelo.","stoutman","May 24, 2002"
3,-9.9,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours clear copper brown, with a very thin head that vanishes is a flash of an eye. Smelled a little acidic with no real appealing aromas. The tast was nothing really to note, very thin on flavors. Maybe some sweetness from malt or baley. No hops that I noticed. Very thin, watery going down. It was drinkable, after a 12 hour workday, and free. It looked better than it tasted, the bottle is nice enough, unique shape and gold lettering, but that's about it. I know not to buy it.","StevieW","May 17, 2002"
3.32,-0.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Clear dark copper hue.  The thick head quickly settles into a persistent head that leaves a sparse lace. There's more character in aroma than typical for the insipid style. Notes of toffee, biscuit malt, and rich Munich malt are discernable, but not assertive.  Rather than the addition of caramel coloring only, (real) malt flavors are contributed by crystal and Munich malt. Hop bitterness is low, and residual sweetness thus asserts itself.  Finishes sweet and clean. If considered an American Dark Lager Negra Modelo has more flavor and malt character than average for style, though as a beer in itself it isn't outstanding.  Like other European - derived Mexican lagers, it does need to be paired with food.","marc77","May 15, 2002"
3.11,-6.6,3,2,3,3.5,4.5,"The only real complaint you can have about this beer is that the flavor is definitely thin. What flavor there is, is pleasant. Little to no hops in aroma or taste makes this a very easy drinking beer. There's also a little more to the palate than you'd expect from the light taste. If you ever get a beer craving in a Mexican restaurant, this and Dos Equis are your only two real choices.","aracauna","May 14, 2002"
3.21,-3.6,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"A very clear dark brown, big initial head that calms quickly -- like an American macro.  Muted aroma at best, mostly of malt.  One/two flavor profile -- malt, then hop flavor.  Neither is extraordinary, almost deliberately practiced to be non-offensive.  Fairly good mouthfeel, helped by a lack of over-carbonation.  The malt sweetness seems to dominate but is lacking as far as interesting tastes.  An OK beer, in my opinion, but one lacking in the complexity and memorability categories.","ADR","May 13, 2002"
3.49,4.8,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is one of the more flavorful Mexican beers. It is like Dos Equis Amber but with a smoother mouthfeel and a bit of malty sweetness.  Goes well with beef enchiladas.  It has nothing on well-made English and German beers, but it is not bad beer at all.  I recommend it within the context of the Mexican restaurant only, otherwise there are better beers to have.","EagleTalon","May 12, 2002"
3,-9.9,3,3,3,3,3,"Feliz Cinco de Mayo! I decided to try the ubiquitous "dark beer" in celebration of the ubiquitous Mexican holiday. Pours a medium brown, translucent amber, with practically no head. Aromas are not offensive, nor are they memorable. Slightly malty, slightly herbal, whatever. The taste is very light, also not necessarily offensive. Barely bitter, slightly dry, absolutely no lingering finish. If you drink this with Mexican food, make sure it isn't spicy, otherwise this beer tastes like water. Average on all counts. If you feel the need to drink a Mexican beer, though, at least this isn't offensive.","mophie","May 04, 2002"
3.51,5.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Light overall aroma that's mostly malt with a bit of roastedness to it.  Full head. Reddish brown almost copper, very clear.  Fairly heavy carbonation is what I noted first.  Light overall malt taste with some roastedness and caramel qualities.  Finishes with just a hint of bitterness.  There is a creaminess to the feel that I like.  Seems refreshing.  Probably good with spicey food.","garymuchow","Apr 21, 2002"
3.34,0.3,4,2.5,3.5,3,4,"I like this beer. It has a very bubbly head which quickly leveled to a thin lace. The dark color is very appealing.
