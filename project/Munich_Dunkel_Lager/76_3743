3.44,-10.9,4,3.75,3.25,3,3.5,"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getr√§nke. Beautiful clear mahogany pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing. Very earthy, malty nose with hints of brown bread, caramel, brown sugar, tea, and subtle cocoa. The taste follows suit lots of earthiness and brown bread along with hints of toffee, tea, caramel, tobacco, subtle cocoa, and leather. The mouthfeel is thinner than expected with really low carbonation and a lot of mineral character on the finish. Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this. The mineral taste was really off-putting and it was sweeter than I had expected. Probably won't revisit...","beerdrifter","Jan 30, 2014"

Nose has some copper/metal, dark malts with some fruitiness. Taste has more dark malts, still a bit of metal, dark fruits and some caramel and bread. A bit of graininess. Fairly light feel, almost watery. A drinkable Munich Dunkel, with medium carbonation and a moderate sweetness in the finish.","liamt07","Feb 27, 2012"

In the taste, a small maltiness, small notes of fruit, but really lacking flavor. A smooth and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a note of dry maltiness in the aftertaste. A small aroma, but lacking everywhere else, not much there.","OWSLEY069","Dec 30, 2011"

4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Found this gem on tap at Ludwigs. This beer was a deep and clear dark amber-orange color. The head was thin, creamy and sustaining. The aroma yields roasted buttery grains, toffee and toasted pumpernickel bread. Roasted rich caramels, chestnut and pistachio with just a touch of smokiness. Medium bodied, buttery, slightly spicy and rich in flavor. No discernable harshness, just pleasantly sweet roasted malt. Smoky and roasted bitterness in the finish. This is a complex and satisfying beer. A real treat.","pezoids","Aug 15, 2003"
4.25,10.1,4,4,4,4.5,5,"Dark amber and clear appearance, with a frothy head of 1/4 of an inch. Simple string laces. Sweet aroma, caramel and slight apple emphasis. Nice mouthfeel, velevety with a stylish moderate carbonation. Flavor is exceptionally well balanced, good combination of malt impressions that cross into shortbread and peach preserves -- like jam on toast. Slight hop assertion, somewhat oak-like at the close, slight drying. This is no moster brew, just really well-composed and exceptionally quaffable.","ADR","Jul 19, 2003"

3.53,-8.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A deep brown on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the color a light tan as it dissipates the lace left behind a nice covering upon the glass. Mostly malt nose, sweet, hints of caramel, clean and fresh, with the start sweet and thickly malt, top moderate in feel, the finish is moderately carbonated, the hops pleasing in their spicy presence, quite dry and drinkable.","Gusler","Beers"
