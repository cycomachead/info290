This doesn't exactly stand up to its german counterparts but If I was in the mood for a dunkel and this was on tap I would not pass it up.

Nose of roast notes, coffee, and dark caramel, and some fig and date notes. Flavors are roast and nutty forward, with some old world fruit sweet highlights, and a bitter undertone. Smooth and crisp bodied, with a tangy caramel sweetness and roasted notes. Crisp, clean finish, with a sweet linger. Very solid brew!","GarthDanielson","Apr 13, 2014"

4.41,13.4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark Cloud pours into a ruby color with significant lacing. It's smell is a complex blend of coffee, toffee, and malts, amongst others. The taste is bready, chocolatey, and a little malty with a late rush of toffee sweetness. Honestly, it's difficult to even detect any hoppy bitterness. It feels very well-balanced and medium-bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. A very drinkable and sessionable lager but far more complex than that designation might suggest. An awesome achievement for a Carolina brewery.","walkinginplace","Dec 24, 2013"

After sampling the beers he had, especially the barrel aged Tripel Overhead, I sure hope they can make it work. Anyway, this was a nice version of the Munich Dunkel. It was light in body, but dark in color, and had a pleasant coffee/chocolate taste. Along with the nice taste, it had a good nutty/malty/chocolate smell, with a slight hop undertone. Very easy to drink, because I do like the maltier beers, and it's even better when they don't have you feeling bloated.","JISurfer","Dec 11, 2010"

Pours a mahogany brown with a semi-hazy clarity and a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch skim with a couple semi-concentric bands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses malt, dark fruit and perhaps cocoa. Taste follows nose - more cocoa and less fruit is expressed in the flavor profile; very tasty without being overly sweet. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation. I'm not overly familiar with the style, but I found Dark Cloud to be quite tasty and easy drinking. All and all very enjoyable brew.","Jwale73","Nov 16, 2010"

3.83,-1.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Solid two fingers of cream tan to eggshell white, airy but doesn't dimple much, retention is decent just a steady, even dissipation, the lacing steals the show with nice thick streaks clinging tenaciously. Bronzed orange to redwood in color, its clarity is obvious, however, its darkness of hue prevents transparency from any distance, slightly more orange at the glass bottom. The nose unfolds layers of sweet maltiness, caramel, butterscotch, molasses and chocolate fudge, blends in some orange reduction, cherry syrup and brandy-like notes, still you do get a little graininess, if nothing overtly hoppy. Full-bodied without heaviness, inches forward at a slow, steady gait. Drier here than the nose might suggest, that said, definitely leads with molasses, caramel, chocolate and vanilla, maybe even a little licorice before getting to the more natural orange zest. Bready like raisin bread, mild wheat accents. The carbonation is about average and unobtrusive, While dry, doesn't detract from a softer touch on the tongue. While may lack complexity for some, better thought of as a beer crafted for simple enjoyment. And does very well for itself as such.","farrago","Aug 17, 2010"

3.9,0.3,4,4,4,3,4,"This lager drinks like an ale with a highly malty body full of complexities. Caramel is the most obvious flavor, while prunes and other dried fruits hide in the back. I usually find these flavors to be overbearing, but this beer is very well balanced. Hops do their job of balance and nothing more. This is a very finely crafted dunkel, I hope these beers find their way to Ohio soon!","Greencoat","Jun 08, 2010"
4.15,6.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall, this was another solid beer from Mother Earth, which is becoming one of my favorite NC breweries. This beer paired very nicely with the bbq I was eating on Saturday night.","thegodfather2701","May 31, 2010"

4.07,4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall, a really solid effort from a new brewery. I'm glad a NC brewery has finally produced a nice lager. Having local access to this, I have to say that this will be a regular in my rotation.","javincik","May 21, 2010"

4.15,6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark brown color with a thin tan head. The aroma has some nice malty complexity with notes of cocoa, pumpernickel bread, oats, chocolate and a little dirt, along with some toffee and coffee. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, with a huge maltiness that is reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, coffee, toffee, pumpernickel bread, and some peat, along with a mineral hoppiness and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is appropriately light without being thin, and drinkability is really good. Really solid dunkel here, this isn't a style that I'm especially familiar with or fond of but this beer was nicely executed.","silver0rlead","Apr 21, 2010"
4.33,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: You can drink these all night. Its a world class beer and its definitely good enough to satisfy your tastebuds day after day.","rockyfire","Apr 15, 2010"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured a deep garnet with a thin but well retained off white head,a nice mix of cocoa and roasted nut in the nose,rich aromas.Flavors are well rounded with a mix of sweet caramel malt and bitter unsweetened chocolate,a nice earthy/roasty finish makes it highly drinkable.A very nice dunkel lager,not overly sweet but just the right amount,well done.","oberon","Apr 11, 2010"

3.77,-3.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer is fairly full-bodied with a good carbonation backing. Sweet flavors of bittering dark chocolate, toffee, molasses, and a good mealy finish. Bitterness is very low on this one. This is all malts and I like it. Very good beer. I'd get a sixer of this and enjoy it immensely.","Onenote81","Apr 06, 2010"
3.77,-3.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a very dark copper-brown under a small - but thick and creamy - cap. Rich, dark and fruity aroma...kind of toasted, raisin-bready with a hint of toffee. Mildly sweet dark malt flavor. Toasty caramel and chocolate with a slight bit of bread crust and finishing tartness. Lightly bitter, medium-light bodied, and a little creamy. Pretty good...I've liked everything I've had from these guys so far. Easily drinkable.","wedge","Apr 05, 2010"

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The drink is medium-bodied with sedate carbonation, and is highly-quaffable, to say the least. This particular Mother Earth beer is mild, refreshing, and pretty damned delicious, but could never be accused of overpowering anyone's tastebuds, making this "dark" brew a pretty clever full-time offering from the new guys on the block. Given the targeted regional clientele and it's traditional loyalty to BMC pale lagers and the like, Dark Cloud is both an easy step in the craft direction for those more experimental drinkers amidst the masses, and a damned fine treat for hardcore "subtle beer"-loving geeks alike.","cvstrickland","Jan 11, 2010"
3.98,2.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured a dark blown color with a small tan head that diminishes to a ring quickly. Lacing is minimal. Good blend of sweetness and maltness. Drinkability and mouthfeel is very good with this one due to the light body and medium carbonation. Great session beer for the winter months.","callisbeers","Dec 08, 2009"
3.85,-1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a very dark brown with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight fruit and dark malts. The taste is a nice blend of sweet fruits, dark malts, molasses and slight dried fruits. The beer is fairly light bodied and smooth with mild carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, especially for the colder months.","atsprings","Nov 16, 2009"
3.85,-1,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"This is my first beer from this new brewery, and I'd have to say I am pretty impressed. If I see this on the shelves I wouldn't hesitate to buy a six-pack. Definitely worth trying.","evantwomey","Nov 03, 2009"
