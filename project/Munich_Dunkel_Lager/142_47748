Pours crystal clear ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, pear, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, pear, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Zero bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of carmel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, pear, apple, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with a very clean finish with zero cloying flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Munich dunkel style. Good balance and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 11, 2014"

3.35,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a decent example of a Dunkel, but I tend to like my Dunkel to have a more noticeable roasted malt aspects and with this beer it was the dark fruits that seemed to stick out the most and that's not really what I'm looking for in a good Dunkel. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp and not filling at all, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and one would be enough for me, but if I wasn't worried about taste I'm sure I could drink more than a few of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was nice and it worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that it wasn't as true to style as I would like and it didn't seem as balanced as some of the better Dunkels. I wouldn't buy a bottle of this again, but I would for sure try it on tap to see if it's any different and I wouldn't recommend this one as a good Dunkel. All in all I was little let down with this one, I was expecting a pretty good Dunkel, but this one didn't live up to my expectations and so far it's my least favorite Spaten beer, better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me.","StoutHunter","0"

This is a smooth, dark, rich and semi-sweet brew that is very easy to drink (almost goes down like water). I am a big fan of Spaten in general, this being my favorite variety they put out. The purity of the ingredients lend to the purity of the flavor balance and smooth quality of this beer. The flavor of the malt and hops is so delicately balanced being a dark beer it makes this one of the more unique German beers that I have found. The smell is very sharp, fresh and potent which matches the full and robust flavor upon first sip. These are easy to drink indeed, but watch out because they pack a whallop of alcohol that can sneak up on you.","Brouwerij78","Oct 01, 2013"

There are aromas of toffee and roasted malt. I don't get many hop notes in the nose. The taste follows the nose. There's some mild sweetness and the roasted malt is there. The hops bring some grassy flavors. It's very straightforward and non-offensive. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth with a crisp finish. It's very drinkable.

3.7,0.8,4,4,3.5,3,4,"This beer has a great true to the name dark brown body with a thick foamy. The lace follows the body as you drink all the way to the bottom, in tight clusters. It has roasted malty aroma. The flavor is a little bit metallic but not enough to really care about. The taste of this beer is all about roasty caramel like malt. The mouthfeel is a little more watery than I thought it would be but it is still a medium bodied beer.","MTNboy","Sep 01, 2009"

3.95,7.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a 1/2" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice sweet caramel malt nose with a dry lager yeast aroma. The is a bit of roasted character as well. The taste is good. It has a smooth pilsner and crystal malt flavor that goes down really easy and finishes dry with some light residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a tad too much carbonation. This is a good drinker. I like this one better than the their regular offering.","WesWes","Aug 22, 2009"
3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: It reminds me of a lighter bodied, average tasting bock beer. It's simple and sweet but not cloying, so I could see myself drinking a few more of these.","generallee","Aug 14, 2009"

3.33,-9.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer poured a dark brown with a reddish tinge and a single-finger tan head. The smell is some bready malt and graininess. The taste starts off with some toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness towards the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer has no problem with drinkability, but doesn't really stand out or strike me as a great version of the style.","TheTrevor","Jul 22, 2009"
3.6,-1.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Spaten Dunkel pours a dark brown body with ruby hues. Sweet caramel aroma. Palate is caramel, brown sugar, with nutty malt flavors in the finish. Crisp and smooth. A pretty good Dunkel. Very simple, but also quite sessionable and affordable. Good dark(er) beer to introduce to folks who think all dark beers are rich and heavy.","BradLikesBrew","Jul 20, 2009"
3.2,-12.8,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability is lessened by the lack of finish and carbonation. Weak mouth feel. This beer is not hard to drink just very boring.","daledeee","Jul 18, 2009"
3.41,-7.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a dark brown color with red tint and 1/2 inch head. Very weak aroma, mild grains. Taste is also mild, a tad malty, overall pretty good. Feels medium bodied in mouth and is fairly drinkable. Overall a pretty good brew.","tone77","Jul 18, 2009"

3.61,-1.6,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor follows nose with bitterness and a soft pungent mouthfeel that feels like hop or grain tannins. A deeper maltiness grows with a solid honey/caramel base and soft roast. Hints of vanilla. Finishes softly bitter with a hint of chocolate roast. Tastes good. Feels pretty good.

Very earthy in the aroma with some grain. Some light chocolate and caramel in the taste but no depth. Quick, dry finish. I expected more from this beer. Was a little let down. The first Spaten beer that I didn't care for too much.","atpben","0"
4.02,9.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Opinion: I really like the overall flavor and presentation of this beer. It is a little on the light side for my taste, but it is no chump. I never concentrated on the relationship between the flavor and aroma on this beer like I did tonight, so it has opened my eyes to what this beer may be lacking. Some other Dunkels have a lot more toasty qualities to the beer the whole way through, and the melanoidins to make you think that you are drinking something like a "Bock light". This beer has more specialty malts to make the flavor profile than processes or malt complexity from the base Munich malt. I like this beer a lot from just a drinkability perspective, but from a stylistic standpoint...I prefer other examples of this style more.","SkeeterHawk","May 20, 2009"
3.93,7.1,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,"Very tasty and easy to drink beer. Stronger flavored than most beers of this type. The assertive flavor makes this one stand out.","Zorro","May 19, 2009"

3.9,6.3,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Taste is silky roasty and toasty malts. Just enough sweetness to hold the burnt toast bitter aspect of the beer. Pretty full body for a lager, but thin enough to go down the hatch at a rapid pace. Refreshing crispness and moderatly high carbonation make this a good beverage any time of year. Falls just a touch short of the Hofbrau version, but no by too much. Tasty.","twiggamortis420","May 15, 2009"

3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours brown with dull orange hues and a good looking two-finger creamy tan head which dissipates rapidly, settling into a thin head and leaving a very diminutive lacing around the glass. Smells of toasted malts with some sweet and sour undertones. Tastes of sweet malts, honey and spice and is fairly complex for a dunkel, but not really big or anything, just nice and tasty. A slight alcohol heat shows up toward the very end. Goes down smooth with some crisp edges. There's not a lot of carbonation to speak of. Nice dunkel which is suiting me very well at the moment with the right amount of taste which doesn't detract from its drinkability. Damn, why did BL completely ruin that word!","stephens101","Apr 20, 2009"

3.65,-0.5,4,4,3,3.5,4.5,"Pours a cola colored brownish hue with copper highlights. Less than one finger of head after the pour, but leaves some film that slowly recedes to nothing. Crip toasted and light roasted malt nose that smells very sessionable. Roasted malts mix very well with the toasted malts and balancing grassy hops. The finish is just a little metallic when its too cold. Let this beer warm up just a bit, and you have a great session dunkel.","scruffwhor","Mar 05, 2009"
