3.83,7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Aroma is deep and dark from the start. Rich dark caramel notes are all over this one. Vanilla, hints of oak, Roasted nuts, some brown sugar, dark frits, figs maybe? Really just complex as I even pull a touch of vanilla through after a few minutes. Really nice, and quite full feel for the style, due in most part to near perfect carbonation. This allows the flavor to roll across the palate and really just cling to every ounce of taste buds you have. Caramel, bready notes, hints of light spice are all leading the charge here","mikesgroove","Mar 08, 2011"

3.95,10.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pretty brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is overwhemingly of malts. Taste is good, lots of malts, a bit of sweetness, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer.","tone77","Aug 24, 2010"
2.31,-35.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"SFDL pours out your dark brown pond water color and comes into the glass a deep dark bark brown color with a short lived cap of cocco looking head that's frosty. No stick. Smell is kinda really bad and it just smells off, fresh can by the way. Uh, smells like roasted malt, degraded grain and shame. Taste is no better, i really feel like im drinking pond water here. I cant describe it, not my bag. Feel is watery not lively, kinda flat and weird? I drank all six and I will never do it again.","BARFLYB","May 21, 2010"

3.06,-14.5,4,3,3,3,3,"On-tap at Cole's. No aroma, a nice dark brown colour with a minimal white head, however lots of lace ws left after draining. A basic dunkel, Ok drinkability, above average carbonation. Brown sugga.Fairly uninteresting, chocolate malts, a drop of bitterness.","Sammy","Oct 15, 2009"
3.4,-5,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Drink is decent. A malty beverage and a very surprising taste is coming out of this can. I am so used to seeing piss yellow beer coming out of a can. This is a treat.","TheFightfan1","Oct 03, 2009"

3.05,-14.8,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Pours a caramel amber with very fizzy head, down to nothing as I look again. Smells of cherries and fermenting fruits. Pretty malty on the nose and tongue, I get no hops at all. Pretty average dunkel I suppose. Its very sticky and has hints of caramel but this beer is not a knockout at any level.","kiddynamite920","Apr 12, 2009"

3.59,0.3,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"D - If I had to pound Dunkel Lagers this would be an OK choice - don't like it quite as much a Denison's Dunkel, which ahd a much richer flavor profile. Still, the low ABV, medium carbonation, and nice texture make it pretty session ideal. I like the convenience of cans too.","MasterSki","Feb 11, 2009"

3.65,2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, lager scent that boasts of caramel malts and fruity yeast esters. It has a light breadiness to it. The taste is decent. It has a smooth caramel malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bone dry with a slight metallic edge. There is a subtle roasted component as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It's flavorful and easy drinking.","WesWes","Oct 31, 2008"
3.62,1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A pretty good Dunkel from Sly Fox. Easy to drink and easier to enjoy.","Monkeyknife","Oct 14, 2008"
2.66,-25.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours sort of a food coloring-y brown with a decent head that sticks and little visible carbonation. Sort of looks like maple syrup. The first thing I notice is that the mouthfeel is oily and weak. Aroma and taste are just straight up bland as hell. I really am not getting any flavors in any direction. This could be the most neutral beer ever. Hmm that's really all there is to say. It doesn't taste bad, but it also doesn't taste like anything. Wow, it comes in a can. That's about all this beer does for me. I'll save the $1.70 extra per can and buy Miller High Life. Sorry boys.","wiseguy142","Jul 19, 2008"
3.93,9.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D - Simple but well-done. Sly Fox makes some fine lagers and this is no exception. Tasty and sessionable.","ffejherb","Feb 18, 2008"

3.63,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: A good beer. I generally don't love lagers, but this one was serviceable. At one point I had the thought "this is what Yuengling could be" as I got to thinking about other lagers I drink and noted that like Yuengling, this is a Pennsylvania brew. Like I said, this was decent and I certainly wouldn't mind having a few cans of this on hand in those situations where bottled beer is not an option. . . .","Kendo","Apr 13, 2007"
3.85,7.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D- Easy and quick nice for the style. Very enjoyable beer, if you see one around grab it and drink it down.","beckje01","Feb 28, 2007"
3.7,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"The 3rd of the 4 Sly Fox cans that I have tried, this one courtesy of Schooly. The beer poured a nice amber color with a slight tan ring around the edge of the glass and a slight haze on top. The nose has some pleasing caramel malt notes in there and the taste is malty sweet with some toasted smoke qualit. There is also a good citrus quality, all making for a fairly light body that is easy to drink. My second favorite SF can for tailgating at Phillies games.","ggaughan","Jan 12, 2007"
3.63,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"12 oz can poured into a pint glass (should I have used a pilsener?). The color is a hazy red and the appearance is so inviting. The head is quite fluffy. The smell is like bread. The taste is pretty good considering I usually only drink ales. The taste is bready as well and reminds me of an Oktoberfest beer. Man I suck at reviewing beers. This one is good and I am glad to have tried it. Thanks go to nflmvp for sending this my way.","ArrogantB","Jan 07, 2007"
3.78,5.6,4,3.5,4,3,4,"I'm not very familiar with this style, but I'd say this is a pretty good lager. Flavorful, with plenty of character, but not too in-your-face. I'd pick it up again if I was in the mood for a lager. Also a bonus that it comes in a can; I hope other breweries besides Sly Fox, Oskar's, and Brooklyn (to name a few of my faves) pick up on this.","auntfloyd","Jan 01, 2007"
3.42,-4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from can purchased at the brewery. Dull brown color. 1" head foams up in a pilsner glass but quickly falls. Just traces of carb bubbles flowing to the top, appears a little dead and undercarbonated. Smell is of bready malts and some faint hops. Taste shows the bready malts up front followed by some caramel and nut flavors and just a hint of butterscotch. Mouthfeel confirms my observation that this one is undercarbonated. A little thin and just no life at all on the tongue. All 6 I got are like this so it's not an isolated occurance. I'll give this one another try but overall it was a dissapointment compared to the others I've had from Sly Fox","beermanbrian","Dec 17, 2006"
3.45,-3.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Draught in Phoenixville: This one poured a very dark golden color, with just a bit of a white head on it. The aroma was a bit light, and had a bit of sweetness to it, as well as a hint of floral. Slightly sweer caramel malt sweetness to the taste. There was some corn notes also. Not a bad session beer.","Boto","Dec 10, 2006"
3.75,4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Medium- bodied, easy drinking, tasty dunkel. I like dunkel lagers better than most lager styles, and this one was quite good, if not great.","feloniousmonk","Nov 30, 2006"

4.07,13.7,4,2,5,4.5,4.5,"D-I like it but it may take some time to get used to.I bought a 6 pack and plan to have 3 of them today and save the rest for some other time.Ide buy this again next year,maybe I havnt had this style of beer in a while and thats why the taste doesnt seem familiar to me but none the less a very good beer from a great brewery.","MmmIPA","0"
