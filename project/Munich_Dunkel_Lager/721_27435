3.63,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D- It's a pretty good drinker. It's more "no frills" than lacking. It's very easy on the pocket book. At $2.99 for a 750 ML, I'd definitely drink it again. (similar to the "saaz blonde" in that respect, more than expected at the price).","GRPunk","Jul 25, 2010"

4.02,13.6,4,4.5,4,3,4,"At first sight in the glass, it almost looks like a belgian, but in fact it is a great tasting, sweet lager. Reminds me of a Chimay, but is only 5.8 by vol. color was somewhat red, and taste of an almost belgian beer. Smelled a bit like Chimay. Again, only 5.8%. Very good to share with friends. A very good beer for Carlsberg. Let's get these in Mississippi.","soupermirl","Jan 25, 2009"
2.92,-17.5,3,3.5,3,3,2,"This beer pours a clear, reddish brown colour with a two finger light tan head. Retention is decent and the beer leaves some nice lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel malts and a good amount of grassy hops in the background. Some breadiness to it - perhaps a slight touch of fruit behind it all as well. Taste is nutty with caramel notes throughout. Some definite fruit (plum, cherry) flavours as well with a finish that is on the sweeter side. Mouthfeel is creamy but not heavy without a ton of carbonation but enough to give a light spice kick on the linger. Overall, this is a decent beer that offers a pretty wide range of flavours. On the other hand, it is too sweet for my liking, making finishing off a whole 750ml bottle of it quite a challenge. On that note, I don't think I'd rush back to it.","Graham5161986","Dec 19, 2008"
3.55,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It tastes a little like the dark lagers of Primator with a sweetish taste to the finish. I do find this quite drinkable ( keep it on the cold side). There is quite a caramel not to the nose and the intial taste. I liked the full mouthfeel and the nice malt backbone.

3.5,-1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass. This Munich styled Dunkel lager pours a dark warmed mud color and presents a frothy head that reduces to a lingering lacing. The beer has earthy flavoring within it of figs, some caramel and a charcol flavor. Overall a better one of the beers the Jacobsen presents so far tried.","Tolnik","Nov 02, 2008"
4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"Jacobsen Dark Lager pours an orange/copper color with a tan head that fades quickly. The aroma is malty with fruity accents (cherry especially comes to mind). The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than I would have expected, but I'm not disappointed by that. The flavor is also kind of fruity, cherry still stands out, perhaps grape also as the beer warms. The finish is malty with a bit of chocolate flavor. Better than I expected, definitely worth a try.","Drew966","Nov 01, 2008"
3.72,5.1,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A good brew. I'd recommend it to a malt lover who just wanted a nice beer without all the alcohol normally found in the maltier styles. It is heavy for a Dunkel, but it is nice and tasty.","shbobdb","Sep 04, 2008"

Beer is okay, but not worth what I paid for it.","biggmike","Jul 06, 2008"

Taste is similar, but iron is present, very light roasty chocolate, caramel, burnt raisins, all malt, fruits, some floral, solid bitterness.

3.73,5.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Rich dark amber, with a pencil thick head that lasts about a minute, shrinking to white line rimming the interior of the glass. Smells very malty caramel. The hops aroma is not very pronounced. Taste sweet caramel and very light on the hops, light carbonation, finishing dry in the mouth giving the hops a chance to be noticed. Overall this is an interesting beer, but a bit too sweet for my tastes. The sweetness actually reminds me of a cheap dark lager I used to find in my area long ago, by Brasserie Fischer (although this Carlsberg tastes like a much more quality product).

3.51,-0.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Jacobsen Dark Lager is the best of the three Carlsberg beers that I've had so far.

Nose has a crisp, clean and fresh front, sweet malt at the back, pleasant enough, start is sweet with a decent grain presence, top is light to moderate in feel.

It tastes like caramel/toasted malt, raisins, bread/yeast and chocolate. There's a nice lingering sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. Drinkability is good as the beer goes down easy and smooth.

3.08,-13,4,3.5,3,2,3,"The beer is lightly sweet up front, but just about dries out by the finish. There is a light tartness here, that is malt derived. Chewy caramelized malt notes are quite noticeable and the complex malt character associated with such notes are what defines this beer. At times the malt takes on some fruity notes of raisins and figs, though these are really malt derived characteristics. Fairly light on the palate, but at times this almost seems heavy and I am not sure why. Almost cloying in character, despite not being that sweet. This is a decent beer, nothing to write home about and certainly nothing to get excited about.","Gueuzedude","Apr 23, 2007"

It has a light, malty flavor that rich with English style yeast esters. It has some crystal malts in it, but not enough to create a real caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is average.

Stronger aroma than other major European dark lagers (or were the others just old)? Sweetish bready malt balanced with just enough hops to keep it from cloying. A good solid example of the style, but at $5.99 for a 25.4oz. bottle, the brewer, importers, and distributors need to re-think their sales strategy. Not enough people are going to bite.

Somewhat weak aroma that never quite gets going, although it does have some nicely soft caramel and doughy aromas. On the palate, there's a nice mixing of sweet and dry elements, with sweetness coming through first and before the mid-palate dries out. Just a touch of raisiny fruits are present. A flash of acidity cleans the palate just before the finish, which is quick and not terribly flavorful -- the character of this beer disappears from the palate in an instant. Mouthfeel is mixed, with good lager smoothness but too little in the way of carbonation; it makes the beer feel a bit too heavy than it should.
