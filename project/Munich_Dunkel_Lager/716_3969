3.87,9.6,3.75,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a deep, rich brownish black with a thin ring of off-white head that dissipated quickly. It looks fairly good, like a dark lager should. Scents of fruity esters, especially apple, some lager yeast and a nice, rich caramel maltiness. A very simple aroma profile, but a very pleasant one that is quite appealing. Flavor begins with malty sweet flavors, some caramel and molasses with a hint of smokiness. This moves into more smokey, malty flavors and some further caramel notes with some Noble hop floral character and a hint of toasted malt. Finish is smokey, toasted and modestly floral with Noble hop flavor notes. Aftertaste is smokey, roasted malt and Noble hops. A very nice flavor profile that actually has quite a bit going on, but with none of the flavors hurting the others. Very well executed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a semi-drying feel. Quite easy to drink and pleasant. Overall this is a good dark lager with a nice aroma and flavor profile and a good mouthfeel that lends it self well to the flavor profile. Worth trying.","Auraan","Apr 26, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, biscuit, and slight char-like aromas. Taste is much the same with roasted grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

I could make out only a little bit of the smell of roasted malt, and not much else. It took a sip expecting a strong flavor but was surprised to find a roasty-malty sweetness with little bitter hoppiness. The carbonation is medium, and the flavor doesn't linger too long. I took another sip, and another, and another. After 3 beers, I still feel like I could drink another 12. Did not expect such drinkability from such a dark colored beer.

It's dark but it's not really roasty, and it has lots of nutty and caramelish flavors as well, but only minor suggestions of chocolate. And some hops appear, in this case spicy and lightly woody and leafy. It offers that sweet malty note at first, but then it vanishes in the finish, leaving it clean and dry. Again, no roastiness or chocolate-like flavors remain. And it's quite drinkable. There's a lot of flavor there, but it's superbly balanced and it never builds on the palate.
