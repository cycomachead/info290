The aroma on this beer is outrageously sweet and malty and has this German nutty characteristic. The body is right around medium. I was hoping for something bolder. The taste is vibrant with malty sweetness and a mellow bitterness to balance things out. It reminds me a bit of Newcastle Brown Ale with a slightly more bitter note. It is a likable beer and one that I could drink often.","puboflyons","Apr 19, 2012"

The colour is a bit lighter than it should be, IMO. The head was about a half inch tall and vanished into nothing in less time than it took to type this sentence. Smell was malty and marginally close to what other Munich Darks smell like, but really wasn't very impressive. Taste was average at *best*, but again, there are many examples of this style that much better represent the Munich Dark. I'm just not feeling the Lammsbrau version of one of my all time favourite styles. Mouthfeel is noticeably too thin, and of course, given all these negatives, this is simply not very drinkable to me. Not an awful beer, but in the way of Munich Darks, there are many offerings out there much, much better IMO.","SilentSabre","Nov 20, 2008"

You look at the lacing, the sudsy foam and the distinct dark amber colour and you just want more. I could (but won't) get plastered off this one without even noticing it.

The flavor is a very dry, nutty toffee-like affair with a marked smoothness. The hops serve to balance the malts and go a little step further to dry it out on the finish, making this beer very drinkable. You get deep rich malt flavor in a medium bodied package that does not cloy.
