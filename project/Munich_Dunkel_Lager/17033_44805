Tastes almost exclusively of roasted malt and not much else. Pretty boring honestly and feels kinda watery. Overall it was fairly disappointing, kind of surprising considering I have loved every other beer I have tried from this brewery and I typically love dark beers like black lagers, stouts, and porters","Joe_Howard","Jan 31, 2015"

Considering that it's available at just about any establishment with a decent selection near me, it's well above the average fare, but not quite good enough that I'd seek it out in particular.","hippogasmo","Jun 14, 2014"

2.31,-37.1,4.25,2,2,3.75,2,"Overall: I'm not sure how to rate this. Is this a German coffee stout or what? Call it that, and I say I love it. It's not as thick and creamy as say a Mikkeler Black or their other's Coffee Stouts, so it'd be missing that for a great coffee stout. So, it's not a stout, but a coffee-dunkel lager? That would be a great beer. That I'd pay for and in fact, rate it a 4.3 of 5. But an "Authenitic" Dunkel, a 2 of 5. Again, I like this beer; it's just shitty marketing to gullible Texans, I don't like. Strange, eh? I'm really torn here. I need y'all's opinion here.","boddhitree","May 29, 2014"

3.22,-12.3,2.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"This dunkel brew is an acceptable example of the style, but notice how many times I used the word “light” in my descriptions? That is probably the main problem I have with this beer. The thin body and light character make it seem like a beer with potential that hasn’t been met. I did notice that the character is better if you pour two- thirds of the bottle into a glass, swirl the remainder, and then quickly dump it into the same glass. But the lightness still remains, and that may be enough to ruin the tasting for some. It certainly isn’t a bad beer, but it may not have enough body and flavor to satisfy the harshest critics among us.","BryanCarey","Dec 13, 2013"

There's nothing wrong with it, it's just average. I wouldn't turn one down if someone offered. Warsteiner and Spaten make better Dunkels.","ranger7","Sep 14, 2013"

4.25,15.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Stumbled upon this rare find in the highland park area of dallas. Ordered a pint immediately and was very pleased with all aspects of this local brew. Half inch foamy head and dark brown almost a stout in color. Smell was of fresh roasted coffee and molasses which was perfect on a cold day. Taste was great but reminded me of a coffee porter which was fine with me but forces my score down as it is not accurate to the style. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent which is why I ordered a second pint with excitement. Highly recommend my first sample from this brewery.","paigertx","Jun 28, 2010"

4.02,9.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Chocolate notes carry through to the flavor along with a definite grain sweetness, more so than perhaps any dunkel I have had. Decent amount of roast and the hops are very tame to say the least. Nice and fresh tasting brew, a bit more robust than many of the style. Plenty of flavor, body is certainly not thin...this is solid. There's some good German brews coming out of Franconia, this guy knows what he's doing.","twiggamortis420","Apr 09, 2010"

4.22,15,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Thin carbonation adds to an already smooth and milky feeling beer. This beer is full bodied and ready to rumble. Dunkel is borderline chewy and extremely satisfying.
