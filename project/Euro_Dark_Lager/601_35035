3.45,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Tastes of toast, caramel malt, a bit of roasty maybe. Light sweet adjunct flavor happening... Smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation gives a pleasant bite/acidity. Not huge off flavors. After taste is dark malt and slightly sweet. Bitterness and hop presence are minimal but suiting. Pretty good, nothing crazy awesome.","mlazzaro","Mar 29, 2012"

Good taste of caramel malts, slightly smoky and roasted, chocolate and fruits. Medium-bodied beerwith high carbonation. Pleasant, but not so well-balanced beer.","Dentist666","Dec 17, 2011"
2.7,-18.2,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper color with one finger of khaki colored head. The retention was so-so and it left spots of lacing. The aroma was of cereal grains, a bit of toasted malt and a bit of sweet malt. The flavors were not as appealing however. It tasted a bit skunky with notes of cereal, booze, sweet malt, caramel malt and an underlying flavor of h that seemed to spoil the rest. The mouthfeel was frothy, the body medium and the carbonation a touch too high. I wasn’t really sure what to expect from this one and even after trying it I wasn’t really sure what to think. Personally, it just didn’t appeal to my palate.","thekevlarkid","Dec 09, 2011"

3.65,10.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"O: As far as European dark lagers go, this one is very enjoyable. If it displayed a more pronounced hop flavor and a little less carbonation, it would be a stellar example of the style. Overall, this is a very solid dark lager, though there is room for improvement.","mrfrancis","Jul 31, 2011"
3.15,-4.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,4,3,"Appearance has a red ruby brown color leaving a quickly dissapating head. Smell of mellow malts and hops. Taste of lightly roasted malts with a balanced mellow hop that finishes clean and slightly dry. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Nothing complex, just an easy drinker.","Bookseeb","Mar 20, 2011"
3.62,9.7,4,4.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall: A beautiful beer in color. Disappointing head. Great aroma and good flavor. Goes down smooth but leaves you with too much syrup flavor. I would prefer to try this in the Fall/Winter seasons. I may get this again.","Criscoh88","Feb 23, 2011"
3.68,11.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Cracked open a bottle for a Sunday night cap. There were hint of oxidation and prolonged aging, but this was still a fine beer. Sure, I'll say it had a "velvety" feel as the label suggests. It's a moderately thick, somewhat sweet (not too sweet) lager that's heavy with dried fruit flavors, notes of roast and caramel, and a hint of leather and cider - from age, I presume. There's a mild balancing bitterness. This really is not a bad beer at all. In the end I'd call it a tasty dessert beer that's not cloying or filling.","tempest","Dec 24, 2010"

3.36,1.8,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a 2" head which pretty quickly dissipated to 1/8". Dark in color but with a reddish tint when held to the light, no wonder they call it velvet. Smell and taste of barley malt and rye. A very mild beer, easy to drink, in fact the mildness is a surprise considering the darkness. There's also a zingy acidity which is refreshing. Very drinkable. Not a whole lot above a good pilsner but still a fine beer I'd enjoy any time.","MoreThanWine","Oct 03, 2010"
3.53,7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A decent dark lager, nothing eliciting strong oohs or aahs, but still rather balanced and drinkable.","biboergosum","Sep 02, 2010"

4.02,21.8,3,3.5,4.5,3,4.5,"This would be great with grilled kielbasa, if you want to pay homage to Ukraine. As mentioned, I can drink this by itself.

3.46,4.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a green 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very mild, some malts.

4.36,32.1,5,4,5,3,4,"I poured this into a Sam Smith nonic. The appearance looked very good, a mahogany red body, an off-white head with good retention, some lacing on the bottle.

I'm not sure I'll finish the rest of this bottle, and I would question if it was brewed with reactor water from Chernobyl, but then that was a graphite cooled plant. I will be looking for a more appealing offering from the Ukraine.","SLeffler27","Jul 21, 2009"
3.14,-4.8,3.5,4.5,2,2.5,4,"I was most impressed by this beer's smell. It hinted cherry and smoked aromas. It was actually very pleasant.

3.75,13.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D - Pretty drinkable for the first 500 ml, but with the strong caramel and toffee/coffee notes, food pairing is narrow, working best with smokey foods like barbecue or chocolate cake.","watchnerd","Mar 21, 2008"

3.85,16.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A decent malty dark lager with a mid to dark colour and a good head. The nose is subtle but grows as the beer warms.The beer is smooth drinking with a nice malty finish. Not the hugest body of a dark lager but food friendly and well balanced. I prefer the pils but would buy this again.","canucklehead","0"

3.57,8.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Looks a lot like pepsi when poured into my new Spaten Hefe glass. Tan head rushes to the top of the glass before it quickly runs out of steam and settles to a solid 1 inch head that is flush with the top of the glass. It then settles further to a 1/4 inch atop the dark brown beer. I really don't see any carbonation to speak of from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of toasted malt, cookie dough, candi sugar, and mild yeast. The flavor is nothing special but in no way offensive. It has a gentle wave in the flavor profile of toasted grain, sweetness upfront, then a slow and gradual bittering towards the end of the sip. Overall this is a decent session beer if you are in the mood for something similar to a German schwarzbier.","Rudgers73","Dec 27, 2007"

2.89,-12.4,4,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Acquired at a JONS supermarket in Hollywood, California, the Obolon Oksamytove is presented in an eye appealing green bottle, with gold and red labeling. A "best before" box on the back label remains undated but the bottle and labels are in mint condition. Pouring a deep mahogany brown and featuring a rich 'n tan head accompanied by a dank and slightly sour smell. Upon tasting, the light-to-moderately carbonated smooth mouthfeel is appreciated alongside subtle notes of chocolate. However, as I progress through the glass a tangy bitterness builds, and there is nothing too terribly exciting about this beer that would motivate me to actively seek it or recommend it to friends.","geokills","Jan 30, 2007"
1.94,-41.2,3.5,2,1.5,2.5,2,"Drinkability? Well, I'll never drink this stuff again, so draw your own conclusions from that.","sbe1","Oct 18, 2006"
2.17,-34.2,4,2,2,2.5,2,"Call me naive, but I actually thought Oksamytove had a chance to be the best Obolon beer of them all. Maybe it was the impressive label, maybe it was the intriguing 'Deep Velvet', who knows? I suspected that I was mistaken on the pour because I smelled what was entering my pint glass. These guys need to go back to the drawing board. Better yet, they need to close down and save the taste buds of a few million Ukrainians.","BuckeyeNation","Jun 08, 2006"
3.58,8.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"M&D: unlike the fiercely fizzy outlook, the mouthfeel is really very smooth, standing up to the beer's name. All's well, very enjoyable, but the flavour profile is slightly too simplistic to make it a real impressive beer. Still, well worth a try!!","wl0307","Jun 20, 2004"
4.02,21.8,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Full dark Vienna Lager. Great color - dark ruby & mahogany. Intruguing aroma. Full and complex flavor with lots of roasted malts and caramelized sugar. Slightly sour finish, rich afterstaste. Obviously not designed for consummation in large volumes. Recommended!","ernie","Oct 19, 2003"
3.82,15.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a red brown with a short lived bubbbly tan head. There is a very pleasing malty chew to start things off, followed by some nice hop balance. Not sweet and a good mouthfeel means I enjoy this brew. Tastes keeps with the front of the mouth long after a sip making mouth want more. A decent beer; I'd drink another.","scottum","Beers"
3.48,5.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a clear reddish amber under a thin off-white head that faded quickly and left no lace. While chilled, there is only just a hint of aroma in the nose - sweet malt, if anything. As the beer warms, the malt nose gets more pronounced. The mouth a slightly prickly with a medium body. Caramel opens the taste experience, mild and even. There's a mild but sufficient hoppy bite in the finish, leaving a nice bitter and sweet (but not bittersweet) aftertaste. This beer was a bit thinner than I had hoped, but not bad at all.","Globetrotter","0"
