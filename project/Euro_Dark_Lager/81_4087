The smell is overly sweet and only has strong tone of malt. It has chocolate over sweet taste with a very chalky aftertaste. It has a full body.","MTNboy","May 19, 2013"

2.48,-11.1,3.5,3,2,3.5,2,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. The coloring was nice, and the head was clean and inviting. The flavoring, however, proved to be one of the sweetest things we’ve ever had. The sugars were synthetic, like aspartame, which was so overpowering it made this beer quite one dimensional. It was just so overpowering, and the bottle was actually pretty hard to finish.","TheBrewo","Jun 02, 2012"

3.54,26.9,4,2.5,4,3,4,"0.3 cl bottle. Pours a very dark brown, a tone or two before black. Beige head that goes out fast. Sweet, thin taste, very lightly carbonated. Reminds me of a beer an uncle of mine was giving me when I was 5-6 years old, a "kid’s beer". It was that which hooked up on beers I guess, so I really liked this beer, also, nostalgia.","Douberd","Dec 30, 2011"

3,7.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Compared to other 'oud bruins' I've had this is not exactly good. I don't believe it's in the belgian style, or intended to be. The carbonation helps a bit but there's just too much residual sweetness.","jerryjeff","Apr 24, 2011"
1.36,-51.3,3,2,1,1,1,"O: Absolutely terrible. One of the worst (if not THE worst) "beer" I've ever had. A complete waste of time and money. My advise: Don't try it!","eduardolinhalis","Apr 06, 2011"
1.56,-44.1,3,2,1,2,1.5,"Picked up a bottle at Superfood in Aruba. Color was a nice brown, fairly flat appearing. The sweet aroma should have been my first clue that I would not enjoy this. Flavor was a sickening, cloying sweetness that overwhelmed any other tastes. I suppose some hint of malt, but it was like drinking sugar water. Mouthfeel was slightly sickening. I managed to sample half the bottle before giving up and dumping it. I apologize if this is to style, as it is not one I'm used to, but I have to rate it based on how I enjoyed it, and it was terrible.","medic25","Oct 12, 2010"

2.94,5.4,4,2.5,3,3,3,"The beer pours a dark brownish-amber color with a tan head. The aroma is very faint, but I get a little bit of toffee. The flavor is more pronounced. I get some toffee and some nuttyness from the malt. The beer is fairly sweet. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, this tastes like a watered down English Brown Ale.","Mora2000","Oct 03, 2008"
1.76,-36.9,3,2,2,1,1,"OVERALL: Not a fan. I don't really know the style very well yet, but I definitely won't be picking this one up again. Too thin, water, and overly sweet. I couldn't finish it. Thanks to my student for brining it in, but I'll have to pass next time.","Jeffo","Aug 23, 2007"
3.3,18.3,4,4,3,3,3,"I couldn't rate this properly because there isn't a style for this on BA so I don't know what the guidelines are for the style. It is currently categorized incorrectly as a Flanders Oud Bruin.","johnnnniee","Oct 10, 2006"
2.21,-20.8,3,2,2,1.5,3,"BTW, this is not a Flanders Oud Bruin, but a Dutch Oud Bruin, a completely different style. Dutch Oud Bruin is a dark, sweet, low-alcohol lager. All the Dutch lager brewers produce one. They vary in strength from 2.5% ABV to 3.5% ABV.","patto1ro","Aug 15, 2006"
3.9,39.8,4,4,4,3,4,"As a beer, it's not the best, but I think it fits the style fairly well. I personally liked it and recommend trying it at least once.","trinitone","Jan 05, 2006"

3.82,36.9,3,3.5,4.5,2,4,"Definitely not for everybody, but worth trying as it's a style you're not going to find outside of Holland.","Domingo","Apr 03, 2004"
1.9,-31.9,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,1,"I tried this on recent trip to Amsterdam. This beer tastes like root beer, I felt like I was sucking on a cube of brown sugar. Beyond the incredible sweet, stickiness, there was virtually no body to this and very little carbonation. Maybe I'm just not familiar with the Old Brown style, but I can't think of a reason why I would want to every try this again.","belgianbeerlover","Dec 06, 2002"
2.18,-21.9,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Smell is sugary, very, very malty. And that's what the taste is. Pure malt. no hops, barely any alcohol in itself, no emotions, nothing. Bring me a coke for that matter.","Andreji","Dec 02, 2002"
2.36,-15.4,4,3,2,2,2,"sweet. I was going to make it a one word review but I wasn't allowed to. This beer is almost overpoweringly sweet and if you aren't prepared for that then you might find it quite suprising. It is also 2.5% so is not very rewarding even if you do manage to get it all down. The prominent "Heineken" logo leads one to expect some form of lagery goodness but I guess variety is the spice of life and Heineken ought to be appluaded for making something out of the mass-produced norm but this one is just too sweet and not hoppy enough for my unrefined tastebuds.","jahsausage","Jun 11, 2002"
4.54,62.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sweet and a little smokey in flavor, kind of woody too though I couldn't place the woodiness. Not for the average but would also be a good starter beer for those that judge a beer by its color. This is a black beer. darker than Guiness from what I recall but not near as heavy. And did I say sweet. This is considered an after dinner or desert beer from what the waiter told me and is also rather low in alchohol content. My wife even liked it and she hates beer.","AtrumAnimus","Beers"
3.48,24.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Dark brown appearance with a healthy head. Sweet, dark grain, prune-like aroma. Sweetness is the predominate flavor with prune/raisin, molasses essence and only hints of bitterness. Mouthfeel is full, semi-slick. Not bad at all, just a bit cloyingly sweet.","John","0"
