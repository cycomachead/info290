The nose it gently caramelish (mainly dark caramel), nutty, and lightly toasty. The flavor adds some more golden caramel to it, a hint of light fruitiness, and a touch of dusty chocolate as well, backed by some leafy and herbal hops. It's got a very firm bitterness to it and it finishes dry with a bit of crushed granite, some bakers chocolate, and more leafy hops.","NeroFiddled","Jan 16, 2015"

I allowed things to settle in until two fingers of dense, deep-tan head had formed, evincing good retention. I had poured it into my Anderson Valley CAN glass, which is pretty darn cool. Color was a deep, dark brown (SRM = > 34, < 44) with NE-quality clarity and ruby highlights. Nose had notes of milk chocolate and a light smokiness. Mouthfeel was medium and the the taste was very chocolaty, more sweet than I might have preferred, but not bad. Beautiful lacing began to appear as I drank from the glass. Finish was silky smooth and I was halfway through it before it even registered how quickly that I was drinking. Good stuff and worth a shot if this is your style of beer.

Typical of something akin to a negro modelo but definitely more roast character a bit more complexity and body. Lightly roasted malt up front, dry grains along the mid palate and balancing faint hop bitterness, roast character lingers, subtle notes of coffee and toffee. Pairing oddly really well with garlic pesto right now, brings out the more sublte flavors. Pretty good.","jtierney89","Oct 17, 2013"

The taste has a crisp green hop bite, surrounded by a combination of malt sweetness and lingering roast.

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, crisp, clean, and the flavors did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these on a cool summer night, I think it's fairly sessionable. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were pretty good and the taste was pretty nice also, it's pretty much what I want from the style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty bland and it didn't get me too excited to drink this beer, I think the aroma could use a little work. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a Black Lager, it's got just about everything that I look for in the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style and it might make a for good introduction to dark beers.
