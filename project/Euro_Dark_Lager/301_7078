3.57,5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"O - Overall a surprisingly good beer, very smooth clean and drinkable. Not the average generic dark Euro lager. By far the most interesting beer I´ve found during my short stay in Portugal. Think of it as a beacon of hope in this desert of craft beer.","Radome","Nov 21, 2012"
3.68,8.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A very nice beer and one that took me a little by surprise. There is a good balance of taste and aroma, with the two pretty evenyl matched and there is a fair bit of favour in each sip.","flyingpig","Oct 05, 2012"

3.47,2.1,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany amber with reddish tones. Thin light tan head dissipates immediately to slight patches of bubbles on the surface. Very light aroma of sweet malt with some toasted malt, a hint of dark fruit, reminiscent of a light doppelbock. Flavor follows with bready and toasted malt, faint dark fruit, slight hops. Very similar to a bock, but dryer. Nice malty finish. More flavorful than most Euro dark lagers, but not as sweet and intense as a good bock. Light to medium body with a hint of carbonation. A pleasant lager with a low-key, but nice malty taste; nothing really stands out.","LiquidAmber","May 23, 2012"

3.51,3.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I like this one enough that I can definitely see myself picking up a bottle again. Somewhere between an american amber, a bock and a biere de garde, I'm liking where this one is sitting.","djeucalyptus","Sep 19, 2010"
4.07,19.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"11.2 oz single. Not a bad looking beer at all. nice amber body and a good thick creme coloured head. Aroma isnt to bad either..caramel.bit of nut, resiny hop deep in the back. Sweet malt driven flavour as per style, slightly toasty, slight hazelnut..actually very nice. Liked the palate on this one, quite full and also smooth. Im going to say this is quite a nice dunkel. Im way against the grain on this one!","Reidrover","Jul 20, 2010"
3.45,1.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"It isn't anything superb but it will get the job done, probably could have used a tad less sweetness and a bit more bdy.","crossovert","Jun 26, 2010"
3.53,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste was like the smell or aroma. There was roasted malts, mild hops and touch a caramel and a hint of other spices. A nice balance of sweet/bitterness to the finish. Not to dry nor sweet. This was a pleasant surprise.","BeerManDan","Nov 18, 2009"
3.16,-7.1,4,3,2.5,4,4,"This is probably a popular beer in its homeland. It's sweet, full, crisp, easy to drink, and has a fairly high ABV for a standard lager.","brewerburgundy","Sep 06, 2009"
3.56,4.7,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall, a pretty quality example of a brew in a category loaded with pretty bad beers. Glad to have been able to try it. Not bad at all.","Nickls","Jul 31, 2009"
2.85,-16.2,3,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This is a non-offensive beer that's very easy to drink. It's not going to wow you, but if you're beer choices are slim it's worth a try.","WanderingFool","May 30, 2009"
3.36,-1.2,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: while the flavor is not bad, the lack of some balancing hops flavor and the general over-sweetness would make this one a little difficult to take as a session beer. I won't have a problem finishing this one, though.","flagmantho","Apr 06, 2009"
3.43,0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Had this in Sagres, and was quite happy with the amber pour. Had a good amount of just offwhite head that dissipated pretty quickly. Smelled nice, with mild roasted malt and toffee. Tasted pretty similar, just a little bit sweeter. Nicely carbonated leaving me with a smooth mouthfeel. My kind of amber lager, I could drink a bunch.","NewGeneric","Apr 03, 2009"
3.27,-3.8,3.5,4,3,3,3,"The mouth has excellent carbonation, which helps overcome an average feel. Drinkability is just ok given the sweetness.","Redrover","Jan 02, 2009"
3.56,4.7,4,3,3.5,4,4,"nice looking reddish amber - puts up a full head , but fades rather quickly- faint sweet candy-like malt aroma - tastes ok - nut brown-ish, sweet and a little fruity - a heartier offering than the adjunct cervesas - drinks pretty easy - i'd have another - not bad.","JoeBloe","Sep 04, 2008"
3.51,3.2,2.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: A unique brew and the best of the Sagres line I have tried. Very complex ..I would get another six pack","tigg924","Aug 07, 2008"

3.23,-5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D: Not very tasty, but it goes down easy simply because there isnt much to it. Its worth drinking if your alternative is a fizzy-yellow-beer, but I would prefer something a bit more flavorful.","TheManiacalOne","Beers"
