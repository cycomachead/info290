Noble hop aromas & slight chocolate hints on the back. Roasted & dried upfront. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Watery texture. Low floral bitterness in the middle lingers into a light spicy & bitter/sweet finish. Very easy drinkable beer.","GONZALOYANNA","Apr 14, 2014"

3.41,-5.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer really reminds me of dark toffee candy. Loaded! Anyway, poured at a good temperature wiht nice, medium sized, light tan head that soon settled and no lace. Color is a clear, tho almost opaque, dark ruby red. Aroma is super mild, only suggestions of roast and toffee. Flavor’s like nose. carbonic tang is in front followed by some toffee sweet with a little regular malt, caramel, hint of roast; bit shallow. Body and carbonation are ok. Finish is like flavor, good length, and good enough for a couple.","drpimento","Sep 11, 2012"

3.12,-13.8,4,4.5,2,3,3.5,"This beer is black with brown highlights, and with a tight white head. The smell of this beer is excelent, smells like coffe flavored chocolate and caramel, but the taste is quite dissapointing, the carbonation hides most of it, i only got a little bit of caramel there. The mouthfeel has that crispy and dry lager feeling, but yet it is creamy, and maybe a littlebit buttery from the fullness of the body. Even though I miss a littlebit more flavor, it's still a drinkable beer.","NilsFrisk","Jun 22, 2011"

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Bought this 0.5L bottle in Prague while visiting and drank it back at home in Ireland. Pours a rich dark amber with a 1.5 finger head that had a bit of yellowish to it but was basically white and it disappeared slowly into a decent lace that stuck around throughout the drink. The smell was great malty hints and some light floral & fruity hints. The taste is exactly what you would expect from the smell and was very smooth going down with more and more light fruity sugary notes coming through as it warmed up. Not a strong or harsh beer that went down great and something I could drink all day long-wish it was more available.","jspruit","Dec 03, 2007"

3.91,8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It pours black with ruby/garnett throughout. The light tan head is okay, but the beer is clear and has a beautiful color. The aroma has some coffee, caramel, cherry, and some malt. The taste is somewhat sweet with some roasty character, toffee, and anise spice. A clean finish for this good beer.","ark57","Jun 16, 2004"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This Staropramen pours a dark brown colour with a tan head that disappears quickly, leaving a thin lace. It has a big roasted smell with some hint of chocolate and some caramel. The taste is a bit roasted with some hint of chocolate, coffee and caramel. The mouthfeel is a bit weak, but this is a lager.","anders36","Jan 31, 2004"
2.74,-24.3,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"There are much better czech dark lagers. This is too sweet, and the grape and caramel flavors don't mesh well.","Charthepirate","Nov 17, 2003"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"(330 ml bottle). This beer has a beautiful ruby colour, and pours with a moderate head. Aroma is malty sweet with hints of oak. Flavour is mellow, just a tad too sweet in my book. Low bitterness. This is not a bad beer, but it lacks "bite".","Sigmund","Nov 17, 2003"
2.97,-18,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours a healthy clear reddish amber, much like a cola, but with almost no head whatsoever (also like a cola). The nose was mildly caramel (kind of like a cola...), while the mouth was prickly sweet, well, um, kind of like a cola. Doesn't taste like a cola, however. There's a touch of sour (too close to the best before date?) to go with the caramel sweetness. There's not much hop follow through at all, leaving a - ahem - cola-like sweet aftertaste. Nope, there are much better dark Czech lagers...","Globetrotter","Oct 22, 2003"
4.7,29.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Was in Czech republic and tried this one.. Awesome stuff for being a dark lager! Deep ruby red clear with small short lasting light beige head. Very faint roasted malt and caramel aroma. Medium thin body. Clean dry pleasant palate. Medium bitter-sweet roasted malt flavour with hints of coffee/toffee and a wonderful dry clean finish. Super nice beer when fresh!!!!!!","stoutman","May 28, 2003"
3.98,9.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Super rich, dark amber with a huge, frothy, foamy head thats 2 inches and sticks around. Settles, leaving patchy, tight, webby lace. Smell is very deeply roasted malt with a bit of liquorish and some floral hop notes, somewhat soft. Taste is about the same as the smell, very soft, subtle, and smooth with good deeply flavored maltiness, slightly earthy. Theres some very subtle hints of liquorish, dry hops, and maybe even some rye. Its a bit on the light side in the flavor and feel though. All in all, this is a pretty decent dark lager. When drinking it, it took me back into what it must of been like drinking beer back in the good Ol' days of Czech, Poland, Hungary, Austria, before the turn of the century.","tavernjef","Apr 01, 2003"
3.52,-2.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,4,"The first thing that meet you is a big smell of raisins, which combines together with a slight touch of coffee. The taste isn't so big unfortunately, it's fruity and reminds a bit of porters. It's semi-sweet and not bitter at all, quite easy to drink. Overall I can't say I'm disappointed because I didn't expect much at all, but it's definately worth trying out. :)","Rocko","Feb 23, 2003"
