Finish is clean and sweet. This is an easy drinking very flavorful brew. A sessioner without a doubt. Simple and refreshing but not monotonous.","mooseisloose","Sep 17, 2014"

Glad it was a small bottle! Oh, and the burp provides more of those burnt sugar flavors. Now I want to light up some sugar and see if I can replicate that flavor.","rickyleepotts","Nov 21, 2012"

3.92,26,3.5,4,4,2.5,4.5,"After being in Portugal for several days without any hints of anything other than basic golden lagers, I was pleasantly surprised to find this at a local grocer. Still somewhat nervous from my experience thus far, I only bought one. When I opened it, I was happy to catch a big roasty smell with some caramel undertones. I poured it in my glass and enjoyed the deep, dark amber almost-brown color, with a nice light tan head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. Upon drinking, I was blown away to taste rich, roasted malt and toffee, with hints of coffee! I had been just about ready to give up on my beer tasting while in Portugal until I found this gem. The mouthfeel was a little disappointing in that it was slightly overcarbonated and left a slightly slick feeling on the tongue. But after having this beer, I got it everywhere I went, very drinkable. Thank you Sagres!","NewGeneric","Feb 07, 2009"

3.5,12.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On a final note: One of the best brews from Portugal, although thats not saying much. The beer itself is closer to a Dunkel than a Euro Dark Lager. Will have again.","endovelico","Jun 14, 2008"
2.98,-4.2,3,2.5,3.5,2,3,"Drinkability: Average beer, nothing memorable. I'd rather drink this over budweiser any day and its the same price at the liquor store... 4.99 a six pack.","Augustiner719","Jun 26, 2007"
4,28.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a nice, easy-drinking EDL that goes towards a schwartzbier (though a bit more caramelish). Pairs very well with shell-fish, especially mussels.","jwc215","Apr 06, 2007"
3.35,7.7,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Pours black, but not quite opaque. Reasonably sized head, some lace. Smell is predominantly of roast. Wasn't sure what to expect - definitely not a doppelbock, a schwarzbier maybe? Roast at the front of the palate, but little else to back it up. Finishes dry. Reminiscent of Xingu - must be a Portugese speaking thing. Mouthfeel lighter than expected from a beer this color, carbonation fine. Drinkability is reasonable - goes down easy, but not much to commend itself flavor-wise.","hunteraw","Beers"
2.47,-20.6,3,3.5,2,2.5,2,"Overall: a not very pleasant dark lager. The first impression given by the nose is lost after the first swallow. I probably will not give this one another try.","AlexLMS","0"
3.25,4.5,4,4,3,2.5,3,"When first poured, this beer showed some promise. Dark brown and shadowy, with crimson undertones. The head is an attractive tan color, and the aroma is of roasted and somewhat smoky malts. Somewhere after the first impression, though, this one dropped the ball. The taste is one-dimensional and very restrained. Its dry and a little metallic. The nice smoky, roasted character of the aroma is lost on the tongue. Theres some chocolate malt flavor, but it doesnt come out in the taste. Very light body, and a willowy finish. It sort of left me wanting more. Good effort, but its not what it could be.","Suds","Mar 05, 2006"

3.75,20.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a 1/2" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and creamy dark malt aroma that boasts of crystal, roasted, and chocolate malts. The taste is decent. It has a weak and watery malt feel that boasts of roasted and chocolate malts. It's easy going, but quite dry and earthy on the finish. It has some metallic aftertastes. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. I was hoping for a thicker, creamier body. This is a good drinking dark lager, but it could be so much better.","WesWes","Oct 17, 2004"

2.73,-12.2,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,"A very nice presentation, but it all goes downhill from there. The brew is appealing to behold and sniff, but that's about it. A bland, weakened dunkel lager probably geared for duller palates. It reminds me of something like AB's Bareknuckle stout, in the fact that it feels dumbed down to appeal to the consumer that would like to drink a dark beer, but can't handle the bittersweetness. I'd pass on this if you're looking to try a quality brew from Portugal.","UnionMade","Feb 06, 2004"
3.49,12.2,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"This beer poured a deep mahogany brown color. Very clear and was topped with a creamy lacy head. Pleasant and subtle aroma of small bits of chocolate, coffee and roasted grains. The taste is dry and bittersweet. Has some chocolate nutty texture. The body is light and flavorful. I enjoyed this easy drinking dark beer.","pezoids","Aug 01, 2003"
3.12,0.3,3,3.5,3,3,3,"It was $1.00, and from Portugal, the first beer I'd seen from that country. It's a shame the flavor doesn't deliver on the aroma's promise, because if it did, this beer would actually be quite good. As it is, however, it's simply so-so, even disappointing after that initial build-up. If I ever find myself in Portugal, I'll drink this and not feel at all put-upon. At home, though, it's not something I'll buy again, in spite if it being rather drinkable in its way. It comes across a tad boring. I guess I just don't like a tease.","Foxman","Mar 09, 2003"
3.83,23.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bubbly tan foam tops this nice black beer with red highlights. The flavors are traditional Dunkel with chocolate and coffee in the flavor and aroma profiles.

2.06,-33.8,3,2,2,2,2,"Well its not that bad, deep brown with a tinge of red, some annoying industrial, plasticy aromas hang around, and its not exactly complex, but it has some nice roasty malt flavours in their (surprisingly), and a is not as sweet and nasty as i thought it might be. But lets face it, its no masterpiece.","rastaman","Sep 22, 2002"
2.98,-4.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"The pour is a deep brown in color with an average sized head and tolerable lace, both a light beige in color. Nose is light malt, with a slight hint of coffee or caramel. Start is clean malt, the top skinny, the finish is bitingly acidic, scarcely hopped, aftertaste dry.","Gusler","Beers"
3.45,10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Clear. Very dark brown, although not opaque. The fluffy tan head holds fairly well and leaves some very nice lace. The aroma displays a sweet, toffee-like maltiness. The body is light-medium with a standard carbonation and a gently crisp mouthfeel. The flavor is lighter than the aroma suggests, but fairly nice with a smooth, chocolatey, and gently molasses-tinged maltiness. The bitterness is in balance but display a little roughness in the dry finish, which lingers with some light roastiness. This beer has some character to it, but is overall a bit light, leaving it just a bit better than your average beer.","NeroFiddled","0"
