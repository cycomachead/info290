It has a sweet malty scent, not unlike several macro brews I've had, except it has a bit more hoppy scent than what I'd expect from a macro. The head dissipates after about 4 or 5 minutes, leaving a residual eighth of an inch or so that just stays around. The taste is better than I expected. I really expected a traditional american macro, but it's better than that. The smell of hops was right. There's definitely more hops than in any macro I've tried, and the sweet malty flavor is really quite good. It's really not what I'd want all the time, but give it to me on a hot day after work when I'm just tired and thirsty, and give me a hotdog or something to go with it, and it would really be quite refreshing.

It's an amber, so you're not buying it huh? You know when ratings are consistently in the C's across the board for a brewery that you might not be in for a stellar beer. That being said, I go by the motto that man should pre-judge no beer, or else he might miss out on something he truly likes. But there's only one way to find out, so here we go. A bubbly almost pure white head grows to the rim after a hard pour. The brew color is a very light amber with some copper hues. A few skinny, vertical lines of lace are left after the head recedes. Aroma is sweet, grainy and vegetal. Taste involves some almost indiscernible fruits, some sweetness, a slight essence of bitterness and some malts, none of which mix very well. A lingering and unwelcomed booziness exists, and it doesn't set well on the stomach during the course of the session, and actually becomes bothersome. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and there's a decent amount of carbonation. This beer is a weird, as it has some underlying complexities that seem to want to shine, but they're all so subtle and unbalanced that any worth given is quickly taken away, in spades.","stephens101","Feb 06, 2009"

Midpoint has a flash of hop and sweet malt, which quickly vanishes to a barely noticeable aftertaste. It thankfully doesn't carry that ashtray flavor their lager does. Mouthfeel borders on watery. It lingers briefly, and then is gone. Not much kick to this one. It's drinkable, but unless the only other beer available is low-carb, there's better choices out there.","Hunter","May 17, 2004"
3.78,29.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Not bad. A dark reddish colour amber, just as the name states. Pleasant smell with a bit of carmel, which I like, and a bit of grassiness, which I don't like. The taste is smooth, almost faintly creamy. A tiny bit of the grass in the smell shows up in the taste, however. Not enough grass in smell or taste to totally discourage me, though. There is a small amout of carbonation to this brew over what I typically allow for myself. Again however,as with the grassy smell and taste, there isn't enough carbonation over my personal limit to completely ruin this for me. Overall, I say this one has much room for improvement, but I still like it all the same. I think I'd buy it again.","SilentSabre","May 06, 2004"

It’s been some time since I actually had Fischer, and I suppose my tastes have changed somewhat, but I do remember drinking Fischer fondly in France, as well as at home. I guess time has passed this beer by. While not a great beer, it is far superior to many macros, and something that the average person is probably going to like as long it is served on the cold side.

The maltiness returns to dominate the flavor although some fruitiness and a bit of ethyl acetate make their way through as well.

Aroma had a nice mix with a full malt aroma followed by a nice European hop aroma. Really a nice aroma. Poured with a big full head, nice amber color and clear. Nice lacing, even on repours. Taste is lighter overall, especially initially (gets heavier later) and compared to the aroma. Mostly malty and nice hops for balancing, yet becomes more complex as consummed. The taste moves to a little dryness, then even goes to some bitterness. Has a sense of richness without being heavy. Some hard water qualities too. Seems like a fairly complex beer for a lager. Thinner to medium mouthfeel, yet richness makes it seem fuller. Lighter carbonation overall. Even with the richness and complexity still a easy drinking beer if need be, or could be a slower drinker too. Refreshing qualities of a lager.
