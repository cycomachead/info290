3.97,-6.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"On tap at Hopmonk, Sebastol location. A smoked beer, really. Smoky and yet smooth creamy. Black coloured. Great drinkability, even for lunch without the sweetness or peatiness from some smoked bears. Its the Death on Taxes on smoke heaven steroids. Notes from 33 beers notebook. Very floral rather than overwhelming smoke aroma.","Sammy","Nov 03, 2012"

4.33,2.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste is full bodied, balanced sweet-bitter, hint of sour, very clean and balanced with sweet dark fruits, plum pudding, dark toast, hints of chocolate, coffee, singed leaves. It is highly drinkable and excellent.","Offa","Nov 27, 2011"
4.32,1.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - Very drinkable. Really like the heavily roasted flavors and sweetness. Interesting mix of a lager, but it turns out to be super tasty.","ngeunit1","Nov 16, 2011"
4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours essentially black in color with a finger of dense khaki head. A nice roast and chocolate aroma, a touch of earthy hops and pine. Some slight sweetness on the nose, maybe a light herbal note. Flavor is quite earthy and roasty with a subtle bitterness. A piney and herbal hoppiness to it. Medium bodied with a creamy carbonation and mouthfeel.","womencantsail","Nov 14, 2011"

4.38,3.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It's blackened and bitter on the palate. The malt character is stout-like, heavily roasted with only a hint of sweetness to support it. This could be mistaken for a stout, in fact, except that there's the subtle presence of sulfurous lager yeast. Nuttiness comes out more in the finish, along with a kick of burnt and bitter malt. Very dry and somehow even refreshing, this is damn impressive stuff.","largadeer","Nov 09, 2009"
4.43,4.5,4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"D: Tasty, has a decent kick to it, and it's filling. I had my pint and was happy. I'd get it again.","Arbitrator","Beers"
4.53,6.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"It smelled like dark chocolate with hints of coffee. The taste was similar with the added heat of the alcohol. The mouth feel is what really surprised me. This tasted much more like a black lager than death & taxes. Very drinkable very good!","somabeer","0"
4.35,2.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - Drinkability pretty high, very good and not too intense. Overall this an awesome schwarzbier, on of the best I've tried. Better than Death and Taxes IMO.","nickd717","Nov 03, 2009"
4.8,13.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is the kind of beer that is often reviewed out of the proper perspective. It isn't high alcohol, it isn't barrel aged and it isn't bottled and wax dipped .... hence most won't make a big deal over it. However, it IS absolutely delicious and a clean relatively low alcohol beer like this is a lotto winner in my book.","TheBungyo","Oct 26, 2008"
3.9,-8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"A nice clean beer with bright and intense roasted malt, pretty similar to a German Schwarz in that the malt is clean and sort of one dimensional, but stronger and a little punchier in the hops department. Somehow seems a little rougher around the edges than Death and Taxes, but along the same lines.","bcm119","Oct 26, 2008"
4.12,-2.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pitch black with a thin mocha head that leaves filmy lacing. Boozy brownie mix aroma, kinda like Southern Tier Choklat but lighter. Some red fruity esters too. Flavor is light milk chocolate sweetness that gets trampled by more bitter dark chocolate. Dry herbal hop finish complements the roastiness. Fluffy body, light but flavorful. Well-crafted beer, great for lovers of the darkest bitterest chocolates.","illidurit","Oct 26, 2008"
4.03,-5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Milk chocolate lager? This was a very dark brown beer with a thick tan head. Delicious, creamy mouthfeel supplemented with thick head. This tasted to me like a light-bodied chocolate milk ale. Though the taste was fairly dry. Not a sugar bomb. Very well balanced, and I'd love to see this pop up more around the Bay Area. So much better than a typical 6.2 ABV brew.","waltonc","Feb 18, 2007"
4.2,-0.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"I see this is tagged a Schwarzbier. Need to try more of these","abfraser","Oct 29, 2006"
4.27,0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"To me, Bony Fingers sits very nicely on the spectrum between a dry Irish stout and the syrupy-sweet American version. Whatever the style, I could drink this all night.","Talisker","Oct 20, 2004"
3.77,-11.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Dark brown to black topped by a creamy tan head. Aroma is dark caramel, and mild hop. light roasted character in the nose. Flavor reflects the nose well. Just some dark malt, mild figs, light hop bitterness. Smooth medium mouth feel. Good drinkability. I had a hard time trying to determine what style of beer this is. I might have called it a porter. The folks at Flavor didnt really know (nice place, but some of the bartenders dont get beer). Interesting beer. I think it great he brings this out as a fall seasonal rather than the traditional marzen.","carln26","Beers"
3.53,-16.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Consumed in October 2004 from the Toronado pub in San Francisco, CA. Poured a very very dark black with a small head and had decent lacing. Smelled on super burnt coffee and deep dark malt. Tasted about the same as it smelled. Tasted super dark. A little bitter and definite coffee overtones. Didn't really catch a lot of chocolate as in many stouts, but it was thick and chewy. The bartender didn't really know how to describe it. He thought it would be best put under a lager. But after I tasted it; I can't see it as anything other than a stout. A nice beer, but super dark and chewy. A bit on the dry side also. Give it a try. The name dragged me into it.","GClarkage","0"
