4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Batch 2, 10/2008 bottling. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, herbal, floral, hay, straw, grass, pepper, musty funk, light leather, bread, light caramel, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy/funky yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, floral, light leather, bread, light caramel, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, floral, light funk, bread, light caramel, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hop, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice biere de garde style. All around good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hop, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2014"

Taste is much the same with cardboard and honey flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earthy bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that smells and especially tastes very oxidized and old.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 14, 2013"

3.02,-21.8,3,3.5,3,2,3,"The beer was poured from the bottle into a fluted glass. Visually, the beer was a straw yellow color with a bubbley white head. The mild apple aroma was pleasant, though it did not overwhelm the senses. Upon the first taste, a bubbley sour apple flavor was noted. The flavor was mild and faded quickly. It reminded be of a flavored mineral water because of the vanishing fruit flavor. Overwhelmingly potent carbonation helped to sweep away much of the flavor. Because the flavor was mild to begin with, there is virtually no aftertaste. After drinking a few sips, the carbonation begins to build in the chest, giving the unfortunate urge to belch like a middle school student. With a more modest level of carbonation, this beer could have been more enjoyable.","JohnnyHopps","Mar 16, 2012"

Given the age of this, I really have to say I expected a lot more funky character in here. There certainly is some brett flavoring in here, but I was hoping for a bit more. In that respect, I found this a bit disappointing. Other than having dashed hopes a bit, I'd call this a solid, if not outstanding example of the style. A little too cidery would be my biggest critique.

Typically reserved for 750 ML bottles, I had the opportunity to sample this French-inspired offering from an American-Belgian brewery. Go figure. The style itself translates to "March Beer" and was the product of Northern-French farmhouses which sought to introduce a new twist to the seasonal variations. True to the style, the beer takes on European characteristics although to a slightly overbearing extent. Ruddy, copper-colored hue with a thick head and distinct carbonation. Faint aroma of malts and yeast noticeable in the background. Thick, rich taste with nuances of vanilla and honey dominate the palate. Flavor overall was pronounced and assertive. A good depiction of the style, but slightly over-the-top.","dsa7783","Feb 19, 2011"

This is obviously a hard style to hit, and I am really nit-picking it here to say that it could use a bit of tweaking on the balance...though I would hate to even speculate where that is.

What a unique flavor. It's funky and earthy, like the aroma. It's a little bready and a little tart. It's very hard to dissect this flavor. There's a lot going on in the taste, but it's tightly melded. I taste a lot of hay. It's a touch bitter and a touch sour. It's quite dry and the finish is musty.

I know I do. Ayway, this beer pours a clear rosy amber topped by a fairly sturdy head o' white foam. The nose is kinda funky, but not so much as to make me go, "Hey, this is some funky shit!" Only certain parliamentary fellows elicit such a reaction from me. The rest of the nose comprises some light sour peach (go figure, right?), wet hay, and a touch of cobweb. The taste tones the funk down to almost nil, though the cobwebs have certainly proliferated. The peachy fruitiness is also weaker, but still fairly prevalent. Some lightly tart berries, some wet biscuits, and a vague hoppy bitterness round out the rest of the flavors. The body is a very light medium, with a light carbonation and a feel that really wants to be sticky, but, like all of those hapless nerds of yesteryear, only succeed in part.

3.77,-2.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D - I wasn't quite sure what to expect here; would it be a rich, malty French ale or would it be dominated by sour funk? The answer, as it turns out, is neither. There is a significant malt character, but the beer is so dry that it sucks the life out of the grain and just leaves a burnt toast character that I don't care for. There is also a surprising level of hop bitterness and flavor, and while it is good hop character, it is not what I would have expected in this beer. The European hops enhance the dry toast flavors of the malt, and all of this is further set off by the similar character of musty funk that the brett has contributed. The funk is not particularly complex or powerful, just a dull musty character that blends into the malt and hops. I don't want to suggest that this is a bad beer, it is well crafted and all of the flavors work together well, but it doesn't do much for me. Overall it is kind of one dimensional and lucks both the richness that I would want in a Biere de Garde and the liveliness that I expect from a wild beer.","nickfl","Dec 13, 2009"

The flavor likewise is dominated by fruity esters, lemons, pears, and bananas. A faint hint of funk. Not picking up any charactor from the malt or hops. Finishes dry.

Each beer was targeted after a different style of course, and in the case of Biere de Mars they apparently targeted a biere de garde (at least by name).

The foam is retentive and the moderate carbonation maintains it for a while until it settles to a 1/2 inch, and more dense, layer. I like the smell of this one a lot. It makes me think it will be similar to a saison because I can smell dry, metallic overtones and a little malt at the bottom. I am assuming the brett will make it funky, I am hoping it will be a bit more sour than the Ommegeddon. The first tastes brings a light, cold, dryness to my tongue.

Taste is spot on for what I expect from a Biere de Mars. Not as good as the superb version released by Schlafly or the more sour JP, but still very nice. A bit of musty bitterness with just a touch of orange peel. Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and oh so sippable. This lends to great drinkability too. The only downfall is the price.

Musty nose, with lots of fruity funk, hay, dark grains, more fruit to go around. Funk is not as present in the taste, which starts off with some nice juicy fruit, then takes a turn for the grainy and dry. Body is right there in the middle, with a nice balance between the hops, malt and wild yeast. Alcohol warmth can be felt after going through about half a glass, but that did not deter me from finishing the bottle.

A nice farmhouse funk aroma, sweet and peppery, noticable candi sugar presence. The farmhouse funk is also in the taste, some lemon tartness, a metallic twang and a slightly bready malt. Enough of a malt presence to distinguish this from a saison. The feel is fairly light, very airy from the carbonation. Perhaps a bit overcarbonated. Finishes slightly tart. A nice and tasty brew.

Again, the Brett is basically complimetary and not too aggressive. I wish it were more sour, but I think they were shooting a subtle quality. The mouthfeel is fine.
