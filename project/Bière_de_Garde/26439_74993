Smokey light malty sweetness hints of floral spicy hops and a rustic earthy funk. Nice brew with a bit of a confounding moniker.","johnnnniee","Oct 29, 2014"

Its some weird hybred that really works. I would love to have a big mug of this with a pile of German meats. Another delicious beer from Oxbow.","rudzud","0"
