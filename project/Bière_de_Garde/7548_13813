Smell: upfront it's grassy, spicy, with some mineral note; mildly grainy with grape and light stone fruit sweetness, sugar cookie. Taste: nectarine, slightly tart, lemon note, grassy, snappy grain, doughy and sweet backing. Light-medium and creamy for a split second, then some heftier carbonation kicks in, pulling it to medium-plus with a fluffy feel. Finishes dry and fairly hoppy. Delicious, crooshable.","babaracas","Jun 06, 2014"

As a farmhouse ale I find this very tasty, refreshing and satisfying. I'm torn on how high to rate this as I find few flaws except perhaps a slight soapy water note, or some odd herbs, an a tiny mouth puckering dry-bitter finish. Full bodied with sweet amber malts, light herbs, honeydew melon juice, powdered sugar. It's complex and pleasant...reminds me a bit of the Achel yeast.

Scent was fantastic, combining light watery fruits, flowers, tangy grain, bready yeasts, peppery spice and and wonderful earthy funk with light notes of barnyard.
