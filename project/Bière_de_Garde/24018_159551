I also get some maple/brown sugar sweetness in the middle, with a distinct bready note, undoubtedly from the hay. Finishes tart and dry with Jester King funk.","TX-Badger","Mar 22, 2015"

But don't let that fool you friends.  This angel in-disquise is that new-new that is on-par with some of JK's finer offerings.  Like a newlywed admiring his beautiful spouse, I'm interested to see how time will change this masterpiece.  Get some.","Theortiz01","Mar 01, 2015"

It doesn't linger, and it's not overpowering.  The barrel comes through in the form of sweetness, cranberry/raspberry.  This beer surprised me, I really enjoyed it. .","MLDucky","Feb 28, 2015"

4.39,1.9,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall: Pleasantly surprised, as I often am with these less conventional beers. It reminds me of encendia in flavor profile and such, particularly with that earthy malty finish. Maybe somewhere between Encendia and Ambree b2. Id also like to commend Jester King for consistently being able to brew dark sours, even one like this with balsamic notes, and being able to avoid acetic acid getting involved. They're masters of the craft.","WTKeene","0"
