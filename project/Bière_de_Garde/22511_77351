Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a kiss of astringency.  All and all a decent beer but a bit off-style, although I can't say that I've ever had an oak-aged Biere de Mars.","Jwale73","Apr 01, 2015"

Aroma is of caramel malts, honey, hints of earthy funk, a dash of toasted oak and some floral qualities. Tart up front with the caramel malts and oak taking over next. Finish is tart and puckering with some lingering sweetness. The feel is medium bodied with crisp carbonation and a tart, prickly finish. A very good beer and very good for the style; toasted malts and oak and tartness with a hint of honey.","stephenjmoore","Feb 26, 2015"

4.32,-2,3.75,4.75,4.25,4,4.25,"The beer pours out a dark copper-amber color with a tiny scrim of caramel-white bubbles that mellow into a nice ring around the glass. In body, the beer is nearly a uniform color throughout with a rich opacity. On the nose, this beer reeks of beautiful funk; lemon-lime and horse blanket tango on the nostrils alongside nuances of pineapple, leather, cherry pie, and deep barnyard scents. What a beautiful nose on this beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes of a wonderfully balanced tartness alongside a smooth malt sweetness and just a kiss of herbal and spicy hop bitters at the back and finish. As the beer warms, a smooth and syrupy sweetness also starts to blanket the tongue throughout the sip, further pressing a nice balance throughout the beer. In flavor, the beer begins as pineapple juice and light caramel, slowly working its way to sweet barnyard and horse blanket. The finish blends horse blanket, caramel malt, pineapple juice, herbal hay, and grass notes onto the tongue. Soft touches of pine and this delicious yet unplaceable sweetness splash over the back of the palate. The aftertaste is a delicious blend of caramel and funk, almost like a softly candied funk. In the mouth, the beer is on the light side of medium, with a soft carbonation and a mouthfeel that is smooth and slightly syrupy. Overall, this is delicious and a perfect candidate for aging. The funk will only get better. Sometimes I want to dislike Hill Farmstead’s beer, but I never can. This beer is great.","Maxwell","Beers"

I've only had a few Biere de Gardes as I wouldn't say it's a style that is brewed a lot, but this is easily the best of the style I've had and perhaps one of the best representations of the style out there.

4.96,12.5,4.25,5,5,5,5,"Overall: Wow, not only was this beer phenomenal, but everything about having it was perfect. A really clean and rustic beer, and borderline a wild ale. I would rate this just below Flora for taste. Thanks again Shaun, Dan, Phil, and Bob at HF for sharing!","cfrances33","Dec 30, 2012"

4.4,-0.2,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Huge, huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing this beer. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass. Pours a light reddish-brown color with a short tan head. Good retention and a good bit of lacing throughout. The nose carries some typical biere de garde character, with some semi-sweet malt and a touch of bread, followed up with a nice oak component. Also there is a bit of cherry alongside some faint acidity. The acid component grows through the flavor, leading the way to an exquisite mouthfeel -- dry, tart, and a nice bit of oak. Even after just having Ann, this was a beautiful beer and one of the better ones I’ve had in a long time. A great take on the biere de garde style, without being in name only.","Thorpe429","Nov 29, 2012"
3.97,-10,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"pour is orangish red with an off white head leaving a decent lace. Nose is heavy red wine, juicy dark grape, notes of oak, very rustic and pleasant. Taste is a bit muted, the red wine is there but the finish is a touch empty. More Brett but not pronounced, leathery and dusty. Body is light, assertive carbonation, and a touch of dryness to it.","cpetrone84","Nov 12, 2012"

4.55,3.2,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a generally clear ruby brown with a large off white head. Long retention and sticky, thick lacing. Nose is a complex blend of sweet bread, malt, woodsy and earthy oak, vanilla, and yeasty spice. Flavor is more of the same as the nose, funky and earthy, spicy yeast and oak, mild vanilla and malt sweetness. Medium thick body, prickly carbonation, mild tartness in the finish. Just wow, as nice as Ann was, this was the standout for me. Edit: Early sample of the 2012 batch was equally special, with a little more barrel (port like) and fruit presence than I remembered from the 2011 bottle.","yourefragile","Jul 17, 2012"
4.45,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Another winner from Shaun and Hill Farmstead. More confirmation that HF is one of the best breweries on the planet.","Huhzubendah","Jun 25, 2012"
4.25,-3.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Bottle. Hazy dark gold pour with white head, very pretty, almost glowing orange. Aroma has some brett, peach, lots of oak, vanilla, light buttery aroma, honey. Taste like TDD Dulcis, grape peel, honey, grain, butter, vanilla, very tasty. Not really sour but has a nice funk and a tart, citric finish. Palate is well carbed, and full bodied. Delicious.","Luk13","Jun 18, 2012"
4.38,-0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - This is more wild then Bière de Garde, no doubt. One of my favorite beers that I've had from HF (and I've had most all of them). I have one bottle left that I'm going to cellar for a year or so and revisit...hopefully, I'll run into another during that time. Recommend.","Sean9689","Jun 08, 2012"

4.37,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D - Shaun's barrel-aging prowess and spontaneous culture have transformed a style I don't generally love into a very enjoyable experience. The oaky, earthy, and vinous notes balance out the malt character of the base quite nicely. That being said, it's not a beer I'd crave often - this may be too sophisticated for my palate.","MasterSki","Apr 27, 2012"
4.57,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall awesome, I would call this an American wild over biere de garde, or saison, but delicious. Great wild funk, sour fruit, saison like malts, hunts of barrel, light biter hops late in the finish, and delicious delicious lacto.","jlindros","Apr 13, 2012"
4.6,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"O - Overall this beer was one of the hardest I've had to review. It transcends styles and is so damn lacto. Its just delicious. Really outstanding. All areas of lacto in this with wild ale style funk and tartness. Really enjoyable beer. Like nothing I've ever had before and will probably never have again.","rudzud","Mar 26, 2012"
