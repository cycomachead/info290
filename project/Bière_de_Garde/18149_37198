The aroma has brown sugar, butterscotch, toffee and dark fruits.  The flavor has more dark fruits, caramel and citrus. Slight earthy flavor like dry wood rounded out with a kiss of alcohol.   Really damn smooth for 12% abv.   Impressive beer that reminded me of a Trappist quad.","Stinkypuss","Feb 09, 2015"

4.25,11.5,,,,,,"Pours an orange red with a three finger light mocha head that sticks around for quite some time. The nose is very yeasty and spicy. Orange peel, coriander, currant, and a sweet bready malt. The flavor follows the nose pretty closely, but there is an unexpectedly strong hop bitterness. Normally, I find a strong hop presence distracting and out place in this style, but here I like it.","BenwayPHD","Dec 08, 2014"

4.1,7.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and rocky light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big plum, pear, peach, apricot, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, light mustiness, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, clove, pepper, toast, herbal, floral, grass, light mustiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, clove, pepper, herbal, light mustiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent biere de garde style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 08, 2014"

4.03,5.8,4,4,4,3.75,4.25,"kind of a strange one here, sort of a holiday saison if you will. pours a nice deep copper to red color, with a dull glow and a bright white head with fine retention. excellent lacing is left at each sip, and there is just a bit of sediment settling out. the nose is spiced a little like a holiday beer, but to me yeast was the star here. its funky and farmy, but this isnt a sour beer despite the brett. its like a lesser version of their red barn ale in this respect. flavor has some sugar to it up front, and a dried fruity character with some tartness, maybe cranberry in complexion, with a lighter grain bill and that wet animal yeasty finish. the alcohol was a little much for me in this one. usually i like the huge ones from the lost abbey, but i thought this would have been a better beer around 8% abv. its just got real boozy as it warmed, which went oddly with the yeast and the residual sugar. made the mouthfeel a bit strange as well. carbonation was decent, but i think would be better if it was even more ramped up. body was a nice full medium. a must share bottle, i would have been wasted if i didnt have a few people around to help. good stuff for the holidays, outside of that context its less impressive.","StonedTrippin","Jan 21, 2013"

The flavors were good, but too subtle. If the Gift of the Magi tasted as good as it smells, I would be picking up another bottle of this. For now, I'm content to try something else from LA. Certainly drinkable and I can appreciate the craftsmanship, but not really my cup of tea. Maybe BdG's just aren't my thing. I'm still very excited to try other offerings from the Lost Abbey.","cjoc83","Dec 20, 2012"
3.64,-4.5,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The taste is slightly subdued compared to the scent. Thankfully the mouthfeel has more carbonation that leads to a creaminess I would not expect given the seemingly lack of carbonation. Back to the taste. It starts of sweeter than expected and personally desired with a toffee caramel flavor. The flavor gives way to the spicy and fruity hop presence. Altogether, I would have preferred a drier finish as this comes of a bit cloying personally. Also the interesting yeast complexity did not come through in the taste. That said it is still a good beer that I am nitpicking a bit.","Jmamay22","Dec 20, 2012"

Hints of sweet malt with a lot of non descript spices. Hints of bretty funk add to the mystery of what sits in this glass. The flavor is complex and a bit odd really. Up front I get an aged barleywine kind of oxidized caramel malty sweetness. Some spices that I don't recognize sweep in to counter what is left of the malty sweetness. This all finishes with a healthy does of funk and spice with a somewhat menthol herbal edge. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy bubbly spicy mouthfeel.

I like the mild spice flavors I am getting, not sure if it is the yeast or actual spices...it kind of has a cinnamon-nutmeg thing going on. I don’t find the brett to be that much of a factor, which is probably a good thing in this beer's case. It already has a ton going on.

This brew pours a hazy amber with flashes of gold and a very thin head that leaves no lace. The fruit heavy nose features hints of honey, malt, and spice. The spiciness is very evident on the pallet, with oak, vanilla, dark fruit, biscuity malt and even funky earthy flavors from the Belgian yeast.

I wonder if the bartender realized we weren't gonna be back any time soon when she gave us the punch card... Either way, this stuff pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises orange zest, caramel, brown sugar, nutmeg, and light fig. The taste holds notes of pine resin, caramel, sharp Swiss cheese, brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and rye bread. This combination does not sit well on the tongue at all, and a touch of booziness makes the experience all the more unpleasant. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, I did not enjoy this beer. I think my note of "kinda boo", though a bit weird, is more than appropriate.","TMoney2591","Dec 05, 2011"

What did come out was a barely transparent warm golden brown with a very thick and fluffy, and somewhat persistent, light tan head. Aroma is malty and fruity, the latter mainly pear with a little apple, and inviting if not strong. Malty, fruity flavor has an earthy undertone and quite a fierce alcohol bite for 10% ABV. Sorry, a half point off there. Full-bodied texture is edgy and a little tingly. OK, not exactly golden (maybe frankincense or myrrh?) but still a worthy brew.","Cyberkedi","Sep 04, 2011"

Mouthfeel was medium with an intense tartness on the tongue. Now, when I say "tart", I mean like fresh-squeezed lemon juice! Puckeringly tart and dry. Finish was Sahara Desert dry.

The funk I first smelled has calmed down into a nice fruity complex but does not come across on the taste. The copper color is really nice and the tannins from the oak of the other range of flavors keep this a relatively calm beer.

Alcohol kinda burns, in a good warming on a cold Colorado night way, but I'm sure the year and half in the bottle has mellowed that somewhat.

Malty IF with a syruppy, mildly bitter aftertaste. The spices don't come through as much in the flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and syruppy with a mild carbonation. I think an increase in the carbonation might improve the syrupy nature of this brew. It is not flat, so I don't think I have a bad bottle, but the texture is a little on the cough syrup side. This is my least favorite beer that I have had from this brewery, and I probably wouldn't bother to buy it again. I definitely give it a below average for drinkability.

Wonderful fruity aroma, mostly plums and pears, with a big honey note. Light funk in the nose. This smells phenomenal. Smells syrupy. Flavor is just so overwhelming. Major brett funk but the malts just overpower this beer. Major flavors of honey, pears, and fresh plums, with an expectional funk. Some alcohol esters do take away some flavor, but lightly.

At first the spices take over, and then a hop bitterness kicks in, more bitter than what I was expecting from this. Heavy alcohol presence combined with the bitterness detract from the overall experience for me, as I was expecting something a little sweeter (more along the lines of how Allagash spiced this year's Fluxus.) Not much of a fruity taste, either. The brett gives a slightly sour presence, but it doesn't dominate. I guess the best description would be like Christmas out on the farm somewhere (or in a stable, go figure). Combines spicing with a dry grassiness.

I could smell cherries, apples, raisins or prunes and it seems they didn't even try hiding the scent of alcohol, which I didn't mind at all after I took a sip. The taste reminded me almost of wine with lots of alcohol undertones. Again, cherries and apples were very present. Mouthfeel was a bit oily on the lips but finished clean.

The beer itself was a hazy tawny amber with a constant stream of bubbles rising to the surface. The initial aromas were caramel and light herbal and floral hops, a bit grassy too. As it warmed there was a hint of earthiness and tart acidity. Light herbal bitterness with a delicate flavour, a combination of caramel sweetness and cereal grains. Alcohol was present in the finish, along with a light lingering white pepper spice. More earthiness and tartness appeared as it warmed. Moderate carbonation with an airy, light texture. The medium body was a bit creamy and there was mild warmth. Very nicely balanced overall. Mellow, elegant flavours really melded well together. Brett character was light, but definitely a contributing characteristic, and the year it's spent in the bottle may have brought this out more.","DrJay","Dec 24, 2008"

Poured in to my Stella Artois glass a cloudy (perhaps from the low temp) orange/red color, with a decent enough looking white head that quickly faded in to a lace crown. First thing that comes to mind with smell is light stone fruit such as Strawberry and Raspberry. There is also a light presence of funk in the smell, which I suspect is a result of the addition of some Brett. Taste is sort of surprising to me in that it is much more hoppy than I was expecting. The brett adds a slight tartness, along some dry grain and fruit in the beginning. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol presence makes itself known, making it a brew that would be good to share with friends. Reminds me a bit of the Avant Garde ale in some ways.

Fairly spicy with an astrigency that suggests more spice than I actually tasted. Detected some notes of candied fruit (fruitcake). Slightly reminiscent of Orval.","ojclark","Feb 08, 2008"
4.3,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a chalice a dark golden orange/reddish color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves a nice thick blob in the middle of the glass and some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, some nice yeast strain, spicy, lemon/citrus, and slight caramel. The taste is malty/yeasty, very nice tangyness, nice touch of citrus, and some caramel. The finish is bitter/tangy/dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty BSPA, highly recommended. Another awesome brew from The Lost Abbey. Thanks Bill.","Wasatch","Jan 28, 2008"
3.98,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,3,"D: The alcohol is a little apparent in this ale. I doubt I could polish off an entire 750mL unless I was eating. I believe my initial comment was "Damn, this would go great with some jerk chicken wings."","aromatorio","Jan 18, 2008"
3.5,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3,3,"The spicing here definitely contribute a sharp, perfume like character to this brew (especially in the flavor); this is not surprising as I think both Frankincense and Myrrh are/were used in that sort of application. It is hard to get a sense if the Brett has kicked in yet, with the ample carbonation I might have guessed so, but the spice notes are still to fresh to really tell yet. This really needs quite a bit of age on it before it comes any where close to peaking; I'll be trying this in a year or so, but it may actually need a couple to really take off.","Gueuzedude","Jan 11, 2008"
3.8,-0.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As I noted above, this beer would be much better if not for the awkward finish. I do think some aging would do this beer a lot of good...I can see it developing quite well with the harsh alcohol on the finish diminishing over time. Well worth a try and will certainly get better with age.","WeisGuy","Jan 10, 2008"
4.25,11.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Notes: A good brew. On the spicey end of the Belgian Pale style and fairly dry as well. Price per Value....ehhh....1 bottle a year and I'll be just fine.","DogFood11","Jan 10, 2008"
4.02,5.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"$14 750ml bottle from Southbay Drugs. Nice orange color with an initially huge white head and then nothing. The first glass was clear but they got murkier as the bottle was consumed. Smells sour at first and then sweet. The flavors are myriad and I couldn't pick them out individually at first. My friend commented on how complex the flavor was. At first it was so peppery and it washed over the tongue with a tanginess, then slight fruity flavors, I briefly tasted the funky barnyard hay-type flavor and alcohol comes and goes. While I am not sure it is worth the price tag, this was a very interesting and unique offering. I'll be looking forward to the next Lost Abbey beer from the cellar.","ArrogantB","Jan 10, 2008"
4.5,18.1,4,4,5,4,4.5,"D). So delicious! Lost Abbey never dissapoints. I love the complexity of all their beers I have sampled and I'm excited to be a patron saint this year!","ChazMania","Jan 09, 2008"
4.2,10.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I'm on my second pour now and, as I expected, the appearance has turned totally cloudy. Man, the Brett is just ruling it now so, me being a fan, the drinkability factor just crept up a notch. Great sipping Ale, indeed. I'd buy it again.","Bitterbill","Jan 01, 2008"
4.21,10.5,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Caramel colored with an off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Somewhat funky aroma, I swear I get a small amount of resinous hops too. Earthy, hay, maybe a touch of funk, but I still get more of the resinous hops in here. I think I get some tastes of lemon and oats too, if that makes sense. Medium bodied with a dry-ish hoppy finish; higher than medium carbonation. A rather different beer, but still quite good.","badbeer","Dec 30, 2007"
4.15,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured out of 750ml bottle corked and caged bought from lost abbey. Poured into my duvel snifter. Poured a golden copperish orange color with nice thick foamy head that retained for a long time. Smell is of cinnamon, honey, a slight resinous herbal scent. Taste is a citrus hoppy biere de garde with semi sweet dryish musty earth flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and the alcohol while present is very subtle and balance nicely by the malt and hop profile. I am sure this beer will improve when the brett flavor and aromas develope with a little time.","sfoley333","Dec 26, 2007"
4.1,7.6,5,5,4,4,3,"Drinkability: A sipper. There are some overwhelming flavors in this that would keep one from drinking too quickly.","RidiculedDisplay","Dec 25, 2007"
4.15,8.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D: Drinkable now, no doubt. Given a few months of 'contemplation' in the bottle, this could be a truly 'magical' gift. A pleasing slow sipper this winter evening, one I'd certainly seek out again - though next time getting an extra to see what a bit of age might do.","msubulldog25","Dec 19, 2007"
4.65,22,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"D- At the first sip I was kind of weary about it. Drinking more and more of it it really pulls you in to the interesting complexity and variety of flavors this beer offers. I plan to sit on my other bottle for about 6-12 months to see what its like when the bretta kicks in. I can see that making this into a completely different beer like the 10 Commandments.","BlindPig","Dec 16, 2007"
3.33,-12.6,4.5,4,3,4,2.5,"D: It's a good beer, but in the end, I wasn't as in to it as I thought I would be after the hype. Definitely worth a try though.","Halcyondays","Dec 10, 2007"
3.76,-1.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Drinkability- Would really like to try this one again. Was in a hurry and really didn't get the full effect and didn't quite get to enjoy it as much as I wanted too. As it, it was tasty and quite different from any other beer I've had. Very odd spicy flavors that melded pretty well.","GClarkage","Nov 29, 2007"

4.07,6.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A patron saint was kind enough to purchase this for me at last fridays (nov 23) Older Viscosity bottle release. This Magis label states it was bottle conditioned with brettanomyces. Pours cloudy blood orange with a white head that had orange globs in it. Aroma is mostly dry with black pepper, fresh hops. and barnyard. Has a dry, chalky mouthfeel. Musty dry flavors at first of bready malts, yeast, and tart lemon giving way to a light sweetness and mild boozyness to finish. A fairly complex brew here. Wish I had a bottle to age.","beerceller99","Nov 25, 2007"
