Nose has a chewy sticky caramel malt front with a deep green apple skin behind and faint farmhouse spice to it. Taste is balanced, on the sweet side but not sugary, well attenuated. Sticky malt, caramel light, apple skin, sweet finish, light hop presence through the finish. Body is light, carbonation is very gentle, semi dry finish. Solid stuff and very drinkable.","cpetrone84","Apr 06, 2013"

Medium hold, the head has about 2 inches of fold which always makes the beer look more presentable. It was pretty sour in my opinion. Cloudy/sediment on the bottom because of the yeast. There was also a hint of caramel malt and earthly yeasty smell. High carbonation. Smooth on the mouth feel. 6-8% alcohol, but a pretty strong armona and taste.","1990al","Dec 15, 2011"

4.2,8.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip, no bottle dating. Cork was stuck and broke off, so I had to use a wine key to remove it haha. Pours slightly cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Small bits of lacing on the glass. Aromas of big grape, apple, biscuit, caramel, candi sugar, citrus peel, grass, and spiciness. Some nice and well balanced aromas; with good complexity. Taste of caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, apple, citrus, candi sugar, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Taste and aromas almost mirror each other. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, candi sugar, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, nothing but a slight warming after the finish. Overall an excellent biere de garde. Great balance and complexity. I definitely would like to try out more from this style.","superspak","Dec 08, 2011"
4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The aroma was rich and malty. Lots of caramel and light bready notes coming through almost immediatly, with a light punch of grain tucked in behind them and a light nose of peach poking up beyond that. The flavor was more of the same, light touches of peaches and apricots, perhaps a touch of fresh grassy notes that were sitting on top a nice bit lo light grain. Intresting touch of caramel on the initial sip that quickly mellowed out behind the light fruit notes, which combined with a long dry finish really helped push the malt profile to the forefront. Nice carbonation kept this one feeling lively throughout the session, with a medium bodied feel that was just heavy enough to coat the tongue. Easily a sessionable ale","mikesgroove","Dec 04, 2011"

Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. More BUPGOO!! Nose was very malty/cereal/biscuity underlain with a good bit of must. It really smelled like old magazines in my Grummy's basement. Yow! Mouthfeel was was slightly viscous and I got a wild initial taste of childrens' cough medicine. That was not a negative, but instead a trip down memory lane. It was the slightly hot malt flavor that really sent me. Finish was a musty malty flavor that simply lingered well after the swallow. I cupped my hands and I could taste bliss.

3.7,-4.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"750ml bottles from 2008, Sly Fox offering. Enormous difference from the first and second pour, as the yeast from the bottom changes the beer's character significantly. First pour is a clear, dark amber. Big nose of caramel and butterscotch. Malty, faintly metallic flavor, a little spicy and grassy. Second pour is cloudy and the head has tiny little bubbles. Still alot of caramel on the nose, though more freshly-baked bread and yeast. Yeasty, spicy character, with a sweeping kick at the end, really earthy, pungent, and raw. Beautiful toward thre end of the bottle. I would almost like to shake up the whole bottle next time to get the yeast moving throughout.","JAXSON","Aug 25, 2010"

3.58,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"On-tap at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA for $5/tulip. The beer appeared a clear amber with no head. The first thing that struck me was the lack of carbonation, that might have been more of the bar's fault, but it really hampered this brew. Otherwise the malt is a light and dry toffee and bread flavor. The hops and yeast pop up in the background with bitter orange peel and funky farmhouse lemon. Despite the mouthfeel literally falling flat, this is a very respectable beer and worth a try.","tempest","Dec 30, 2009"

Having gotten over the "Is it to style?" hurdle, this is still a solid beer at face value. The flavors work well together. The alcohol works wonderfully to keep it warm and inviting sip after sip. Don't let the final score on this one fool you.

4.15,7.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"France hasn't contributed anywhere near as much to beer as it has to wine. Arguably its only contribution (overlooking the method Champagnoise) is the Biere de Garde, a sadly under-represented style that can offer complexity in subtlety like few others. Perhaps the reasons so few New Age brewers attempt the style is that very fact? It is terribly difficult to achieve complexity through subtlety. In any case, Southampton has succeeded.","biegaman","Mar 27, 2009"

First sip is plums and other fruits mixing not well with the massive yeast favor. There is way too much carbonation here and too much yeast. I'm guessing it is bottle conditioned but too much sugar was used. I am not impressed.","ATLbeerDog","Mar 09, 2009"

4.06,4.9,5,4,4,4,4,"Fluffy and billowing head of meringue-like foam. It deflates slowly, leaving concentric rings, and has a slight luster on it's surface. Initial pour had 3 fingers of foam, and still had 1+ after 10 minutes. Color was ruddy orange, hazy with micro-sediment. Musty sweet grain aroma, with a nice complimentary apple/pear sweetness. Flavor had familiar elements of both Belgian Pale & Tripel, woven into a somewhat sweet farmhouse character. Slight oxidation was present, buttery bread with honey, mineral, tart apple, Belgian yeast. Prickly carbonation, with a tart apple snap.","emerge077","Mar 04, 2009"
4.37,12.9,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This poured a cloudy copper color with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like sweet fresh hay and bready yeast and earthy caramel, with some cream and oranges and oiled leather. It tasted like whole grain wheat and bready yeast, with some cashew and cream and leather, and a bit of citrus hops and sweet caramel. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a delicate sweet and sour aftertaste. Overall this was a great first impression for this style of beer! It smelled and tasted great, with very delicate and clean character. It was a little light in the body for my taste, but it still hid the alcohol well and was quite easy to drink. I loved this fresh, and the bottle suggests that it will improve with age. Wow!","Pencible","Mar 02, 2009"

Incredibly sweet champagne taste, really sprizty at the end.","CoolJosh","Jan 04, 2009"
3.6,-7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"My first offering from Southampton. Pours a nice golden orange, with a pleasing creamy head. The head is brief, but is easily coaxed back up with a bit of swirling. No lacing. Not a bad looking beer, not remarkable either. Smell is very malty, sweet. Taste is similar, fairly close to a Tripel, and moreso as the beer warms. Sweet, little to no hop presence, slightly warming alcohol. Initially mouthfeel seems a bit sharp or highly carbonated, but this diminishes quickly. A bit thin, a bit watery, but lends itself well to sizable droughts. It did not take long at all to kill this bottle, and while drinkability is fine, there was nothing that left me with the yearning to have another bottle any time soon.","Onibubba","Nov 30, 2008"

Pours a reddish brown, slightly cloudy, foams up largely (a bit of an overflow, actually because I wasn't paying close attention!) with a big white head. Smells mildly spiced, sweetly malty, with grassy hops and coriander. Taste is a growing effervescent malt with a nice grainy coriander flavor. Hops are spicy on the back end, along with a tart ghost of alcohol. Creamy, slightly cottony mouthfeel, feels big for the style.

The smell was real nice, malt, honey, caramel. The taste, hmmm... I'd say there is a slight caramel flavor, maybe some hops hiding out but this is very subtle, or my palate sucks).

Mild bitterness, balanced towards malty sweetness with cereal notes and light fruit character. A bit grassy and citrusy, with peppery/spicy alcohol appearing towards the finish.

Fruitiness of peaches, pears, and appricots give a welcome sweetness to the acidity. The phenolics play a bit like plastics and spicy cloves. Somewhat vineous. Not as funky or musty as I like in the style, but takes on a more Saison style with a hearty, toasted malt flavor. Very prickly on the toung and evaporates quickly. Light and refreshing throughout.","BEERchitect","Apr 12, 2008"

3.83,-1,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a 750 series bottle which exploded with foam when I opened it, and continued gushing slowly for about 10 minutes. The beer was copper brown colored, slightly hazy, with thick and dry looking foam, clumps of which stuck to the glass. The aroma was mostly toasted malts, and honestly it grew on me over the course of a few glasses. Not really complex, but a nice study in malt flavoring. Medium mouthfeel, easy to drink, not incredibly challenging for the palate but nice anyway.","TurdFurgison","0"
4.01,3.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Copper colored beer with nice two finger head that relents to a significant lacing. The beer smells intensely malty to an extent that overpowers anything else. The taste is also intensely malty with very pleasant caramelization, a mild hop bitterness and hop flavor is slightly detectable. This beer has a complex crisp toasty malt flavor. My first impression was that it seemed overpoweringly malty but my I recently gave it another try and I appreciated the complex nature of the caramelized malts much more. Perhaps the second bottle was better kept and/or served colder, which helped subdue the sweetness from the malt and help me appreciate the complex flavor profile. This beer has a crisp medium body and beer goes down well, presenting different characteristics with each sip. Good beer.","BeerLover729","Nov 25, 2007"
4.35,12.4,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Pours a textbook amber color with a righteous full finger foamy eggshell colored head that resists fading. The smell is incredible; malty, lightly toasted, sweet and fruity...now "do that"!!!! Well carbonated, the mouth feel is full and incredibly vibrant. Effervescent yet grounded in an earthy malt texture. WOW! The complexity is kicked-up 'notches'_seriously worth your consideration.. especially if you can find it over the holidays. Full flavored, the earthy amber malt over heavens of carbonated creaminess delivers the goods baby! Highly Recommended! Cheers.","jjayjaye","Nov 11, 2007"

3.8,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"When I named the best American practitioners of Belgian-style ales in my review of The Lost Abbey's Red Barn Ale last month, I neglected to mention Phil Markowski. His Grand Cru and Saison Deluxe are some of the best I've had from this country. Biere de Garde, while good, isn't anywhere near that special. I'm willing to chalk it up to batch variation and will buy another '750' if I get the chance.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 17, 2007"

3.68,-4.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a big nice foamy head with some good retention but minimal lacing. Aroma of spices which may come from the yeast strain that was used with some noticeable malt leaning toward more dry flavour then sweetness. Taste is also dominated by some peppery notes with a nice malt presence with some subtle sweet notes. Body is quite full with some great carbonation. Interesting and very good overall but it just seems that something is missing.","Phyl21ca","Sep 04, 2007"

3.56,-8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Got in a trade with johnnnniee - many thanks! Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into my DT snifter. Back label had a brief story on beer. It was a copper color with tons of carb and a little bit of floating yeast. It had a massive off-white head that settled into a thick collar and film. A little lacing. The aroma was musty with dark fruits and sugary alcohol. Kinda smelled like a lighter Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Was expected it to be more like a saison so was disappointed. The taste was fruity, a little bready and a bit too much alcohol. A bit on the bland side. The mouthfeel was good but any more carb would have been bad. Overall, it's a good beer but not my style.

4.38,13.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a rich, complex ale that is made to be savored, not drunk with haste. Well done, enjoyable and worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style. Very authentic for US brewery, but then again, Phil wrote the book!","ccrida","Jul 16, 2007"

4.3,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and crystal malt scent along with a bit of bisquit malt and a fruity yeast aroma. It seems to have a nice toasted feel. The taste is good as well. It has a really smooth toasted flavor with a yeasty finish. It's a bit sweet and bisquity, which blends well and creates an excellent balance. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great drinking beer. It's loaded with malt flavor and has just enough fruit esters to round it out; a wondeful session beer even at 7.2%.","WesWes","May 31, 2007"

Yes, I played with it, and thought about what could make this even better or what cheese I could pair it with.","bonbright7","Mar 21, 2007"

4.33,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Large Belgian style bottle, caged and corked, w/o freshness/vintage/bottling info. Pours cloudy slightly orangey medium amber, seems to be fairly high carbonation, with an active head upon a moderate pour and bubbles continuing to rise pretty actively. Long lasting medium bubble head, dissolving to a ¼ inch fluffy film and leaving frothy gobs of thick blotchy bits of lacing. Clumps of yeasties noted on the bottom of the bottle. Nose is softly of honey and vanilla and perhaps a bit of soap. Aggressive brew with notes of more vanilla, light pepper, spicy honey and yeasty goodness. Complex and tasty, great with the salad and shrimps that I tried with it. Quality creation, nice job in brewing one of the more interesting and intriguing style out there. Go get some and enjoy it with all kinds of food.","Billolick","Mar 03, 2007"

On the nose there's some slight funk, along with a huge buttery note that dominates the proceedings. In the background there are some bits that remind me of some kind toasty, caramelized baked treat. On the palate, very sharp carbonation and bitterness off the bat, with some herbal, fennellish notes and citric acidity at the mid-palate. Full, rounded flavors and huge carbonation make this quite true to style. Excellent.","geexploitation","Beers"
