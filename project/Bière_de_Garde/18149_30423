Flavor is very light hay and hops, again with light malt honey sweetness. Does not finish particularly clean or crisp, and there is lingering yeast on the palate. relatively light bodied with medium carbonation. This tasted much like a standard Helles lager to me when I was expecting a bit more farmhouse and light yeasty goodness. Only OK in my book.","BMMillsy","Nov 05, 2013"

Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big apple, pear, pepper, orange peel, caramel, bread, floral, grass, coriander, earth, honey, light funk, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, pepper, citrus peel, coriander, bread, caramel, clove, honey, floral, grass, earth, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, bread, coriander, clove, caramel, floral, grass, honey, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with a very nice malt and yeast spiciness balance; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Biere de Garde style. Very nice flavor complexity and balance; very smooth and crisp to sip on. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Dec 09, 2012"

3.82,0.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"750 mL brown Belgian bottle, cork and cage, with no freshness date. Brewed with two-row, honey malt and house-toasted malt, hopped with Brewer's Gold, Strisselspalt and Saaz, and fermented with lager yeast at ale temperatures; OG 1.060, FG 1.008. Pours crystal-clear amber, with low carbonation and a short, loose head that leaves very light lacing. Smells of sour grapes and vinous malts at first (how long was this on the shelf?), but it smells less aged with breathing. Becomes floral and sweet, with notes of toasty/bready malts, spicy/perfumy hops and a bit of alcohol. Tastes fairly similar, clean, with a hint of sweetness, a creeping bitterness, and a mild malt astringency. The body is light and moderately-carbonated, with a dry and warming finish. Easygoing and fairly good for the style, but it is way overpriced for what it is.","mmmbeer","May 04, 2011"

Smell is floral in character, with solid fragrances of apple, orange peel, lemon, and earthly tones. Great taste, of green grape, citrus, green apple, and hops.

The aroma is fairly subdued, but quite nuanced with a touch of toasted malt sweetness, a hint of acidic fruit and a bit of musty tartness. The flavor is balanced, but slightly malt forward with a definite breadyness that mixes with noble hop flavor, apricot, lemon and a touch of toasted malt. That cellar tartness is in the flavor as well, though it is not as funky as say, your average saison. As the beer warms, the esters from the yeast really take over and it becomes a bit unpleasant. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice slightly dry finish that has a spiciness to it that is not nearly as prominent before swallowing. The drinkability really suffers from the yeast taking over as it warms. This is my first biere de garde and I am looking forward to trying others in the future.","zoso1967","0"

The aroma of the beer was dominated by a sweet, grassy maltiness. There were subtle hints of a citrus/lemon fruit ester. There was a buttery note present in the aroma as well. Could of been diacetyl or caramel malts or both. Hop aroma was low to none. The flavor of the beer was a malty/biscuit taste with more of that butter aroma coming through in the flavor. There was nice hop bitterness to balance the bready malt. There was a slight pepper/alcohol in the finish, but you still get a clean, lagered impression from the flavor like a well-attenuated beer should be perceived. Overall, I really enjoyed the interplay between the biscuit malt and the butter notes. Additionally, the alcohol gave another layer of complexity that I enjoyed.","RiekerStarBrew","Nov 11, 2009"

Rich clear copper, huge fluffy head settles to a super thick 1/2" head, lots of steady carbonation. Looks great. Smells really nice, sweet munich malt aroma. I assume there were a lot more hops in there originally, but since it's 1+ year old I'm sure they're faded out of there. The flavor is great, sweet and spicy with a good solid bitterness. The yeast seems to lend a nice black/green peppercorn earthy muskiness. Mouthfeel is good, rich but light, finishes clean and only so faintly coating.

A very mild, mellow malty flavor at the front, followed with a bisuity flavor, along with a sweet spiciness. A mild hop citric bitterness hits the back of the palate at the end. A light mouthfeel, not watery though, it has more character. It tip-toes across the palate, bringing the cleansing feeling carbonation. This is my first expierence with this style and this brewery.

As it warms the alcohol shows up a but the flavors really get stronger. This seems more refreshing despite the higher ABV, maybe its the lack of spiciness? In any case another interesting and worthwhile beer from Lost Abbey.","ArrogantB","Jun 03, 2008"

The bee is the sting in the spice, which came with the nose and lingered on the tongue. Anyway, this beer poured a beautiful color out of the corked and caged Lost Abbey bottle which is adorned with some of the most ridiculous copy I've ever seen on a beer bottle -- but I loved it. This was a surprisingly complex and easy to drink Bière de Garde at 7% ABV and it really had everything you could ask for in an American version of a Belgian beer, a theme which dominated the tasting this bottle was a part of. Brews like this really get me going, when they which pour beautifully, feel great in the mouth, and have something expressive and interesting to say about a specific well-treaded style. Lost Abbey is a hell of a brewery.","brewdogmrb","Apr 19, 2008"

The complexity is challenging for me to place; sort of a sweet musty candied pear and banana, fruity yet earthy at the same time. The mouth opens with a tingle, but settles to a lighter almost watery texture as it warms up. The mild yeasty malt flavor is much less sweeter than the nose. A spicy peppery finish lingers nicely.

Lemon zest and bread appeared first in the aroma, followed by notes of cereal, yeast, and ripe fruit. Most of the flavour was quite mild, a little bread and fruit, some lemon. But there was a strong, bitter clove character and alcohol warmth that overshadowed the rest and were quite distracting - the spicy bitterness lingered long into the finish all by itself too. Nice texture though, with a peppery tingle on the tongue and generous, airy carbonation. Not bad overall - I got used to the weirdness in the flavour after a while, maybe it just wasn't as prominent as it warmed. Either way, still worth a try.","DrJay","Beers"

Smell did not reveal too much, though I suspect it might have been because it was sitting in the fridge for quite a while. Smells I did pick up were pepper, yeast, and some interesting funk you might find in a Saison. Taste was a big improvement. It starts off crisp and somewhat bitter, then ends slightly fruity, with the yeasty funk still present. It also displayed some dry champaign character in it's overall taste. I was also somewhat surprised that it was sort of syrupy. I was expecting something much more on the light side. I want to drink this beer all night...I should have bought two bottles.

The uncorking went smoothly, and the beer was poured out into goblet, where it sat golden pale in color, clear, and mildly but steadily carbonated. The steady streamers formed a thin head that refused to go away. The floral and hay aroma was delicate and gave subtle hints of orange peel, and an occasion whiff of earthy yeast. The taste was sweeter than I was expecting, with a toasted maltyness similar to an American Amber Ale. Spices were too light to provide a lot of balance, and there was no hop presence, so the malt pretty much dominated the palate.

Fragrent odor of citrus, a very nice yeasty taste and silky moutfeel. This went down smooth despite the 7% abv. But maybe that was because I was about 3 pints deep of Pliny the Elder.

3.68,-2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"pretty good drinkabilty, i guess my only gripe is that it's very subdued. certainly not bad, but open the bottle knowing that it's a delicate beer thats going to do the opposite of bowl you over with flavor, you have to hunt for it a bit.","kmo1030","Nov 11, 2006"
3.97,4.7,3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste has a buttery-like aspect, somewhat hard to explain. Fruity and very yeasty. sort of had the rustic taste of a saison. strong banana taste in there along with some other ripe fruits. easy on the mouth, went down quickly and didn't resonate very long on the palate. sort of hits you up front but has nothing to back it up. light-bodied and highly drinkable.","Lnedrive14","Nov 08, 2006"

3.91,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: This isn't the most spectacular beer, but it's a biere de garde and it's pretty damn tasty. It's nice to see another brewer making this lesser-known style. I can't wait to try more offerings from Lost Abbey and Co.","goschool","Oct 18, 2006"

4.47,17.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It poured a gold-amber color with mdeium head that dissipated quickly, but the lacing was impressive. The aroma is flan-like; almost a creme brulee subtle sweetness. Quite nice. Tasting it mirrored this with some Belgian tasting yeast and hop presence. I was impressed with the amount of flavor that was achieved without upping the sweetness factor. It was very easy drinking and went well with the Spanish salami-like meat the missus was serving.","sloejams","Sep 04, 2006"
3.75,-1.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall: A great start but I have to be honest and say that this was not as good as I expected. Despite its unquestioned pedigree, I dont think this is the Bees Knees, just yet at least, but the whole Lost Abbey arm of Port Brewing is a very welcome development in sunny SoCal and it can only get better and yield more high quality offerings. That said, with a cool head, removing the Port brewing accolades and with an unemotional stance mixed with a candid reflection, I am not sure I would splash the beans for this one again. Even if it would have had a keener price, I feel a bit let down overall.","TheLongBeachBum","Aug 10, 2006"
