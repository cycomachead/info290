3.58,5.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy beige color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, malts. Taste is fruity, spices, surprising amount of alcohol considering the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an interesting take on the style, and a good beer.","tone77","Jan 24, 2015"

Instead a smooth transition to semi-dry warmth and balanced straw-like bitterness gives the beer is refreshing citrusy qualities. Though I rather liked the beer as a non-descript Belgain-esque ale, it is timid in its funky-fresh farmhouse qualities.","BEERchitect","Jan 20, 2013"

Pours clear copper with a thin, quickly dissipating white head and numerous tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass and clinging to the side of the glass. The beer smells sweet and bready. There's just a touch of citrus from the hops. The flavor is bready from the malt with some hop bitterness in the background. There's just a little bit of citrus back there. It's a little earthy. It's an interesting flavor. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is clean and dry. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer.","acevenom","Oct 03, 2012"
3.15,-6.8,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Atmosphere is okay. Nothing special in terms of appearance, and nose is very light. All flavor components are lightly applied. The bitterness, however, comes out clearly. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff.","bmwats","Sep 22, 2012"
3.4,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Here is the thing...if you compare to how a Biere de Garde should be, it svery close to the description of the style; however, its not all that amazing. Maybe its because I havent had many of the style, but its just an ordinary malty brew to me. Drinkable, but not amazing...I guess just slightly above average to me.","DrinkSlurm","Beers"
