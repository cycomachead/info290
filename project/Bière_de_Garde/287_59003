3.03,-18.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"This biere de garde does a lot of things at once. I can see this type of flavor existing before coal-fired steam was introduced as a drying and kilning agent for malts. Prior, the wood fired practices may have imparted these darker, toastier, and smokier flavors to nearly all beers. Perhaps this is the motivation for this third installment of their Jazz series. Even with that, this beer remains lacking in authentic farmhouse character and results in a simpler taste and keeps the beer somewhat banal.","BEERchitect","Oct 13, 2012"

3.75,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a mostly-clear brown-amber color with a short white head. Some spotty lacing as it goes down. The nose is pretty tame, bringing just a bit of malt and bread crust. The flavor is more complex and fits the style quite well, bringing some nice earthy elements and a slight fruity touch. Bread is the main characteristic. Some sweetness. Medium body and moderate carbonation. A good example of a style I'm not particularly fond of.","Thorpe429","Jun 05, 2011"
3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A decent beer from Bell's, but I can see why this is not a regular for them.","TheBear11D","Oct 25, 2010"
2.99,-19.6,2,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Overall: The smell and taste of the beer are good but I was unimpressed with the beer overall. If still available the next time I'm at Bell's I'll revisit this beer.","MikeyRx","Oct 14, 2010"
4.18,12.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel is crisp with perhaps just a bit too much carbonation. The body is significant enough to handle it though, and any less carbonation would probably make the medium body seem a bit on the heavy side. The beer finishes with some lingering sweetness, but it doesn't come close to the toothsome tastes of the Pianiste. I liked this beer more than the other two in the series as I felt the malt bill was more in line with the better examples of Bi√®re de Garde I've been fortunate enough to try. This is worth seeking out, but maybe I'm partial as I've always been enamored with its namesake. I just wanted to play an instrument I could carry home on the bus without having to sit up front next to the tuba kid.","jampics2","Oct 05, 2010"
3.43,-7.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, it is somewhat drinkable, but there just isn't a lot of flavor in it. Not something I would go out of my way to try again.","mothman","Oct 01, 2010"
3.58,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Draft at Autumn Brew Review. Pours a clear reddish mahagony color with a slight white head. Very malty and biscuity in the nose. Smells sweet. The taste is, as I smelled, sweet up front with a long drawn out biscuity and sweet taste. Minimal hop presence. A big and rich beer. Medium mouthfeel. Didn't pick up any alcohol type notes. Not too bad.","kbutler1","Jun 08, 2010"
3.65,-1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: The strongest in alcohol and flavor of the three Biere de Gardes, but the slightly cloying body means that I prefer Le Pianiste. Still quite good.","bsp77","Jun 07, 2010"
3.4,-8.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours the color of an old penny, thin cap of off-white head. Scent is sweet brown sugar, melted carmel with touches of burnt grain and burnt popcorn, slight earthy and clay notes. Taste is not much better then scent, tastes almost like a musty Cosecrator - sweet carmel and toffee, roasted nuts. Medium bodied, highly carbonated, cloying at times. Not the best offering from these guys but unique for its style.","rfgetz","Beers"
3.17,-14.8,4,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mediumbidied with a prominent roasty smoked flavor up front with hints of acrid burnt malt and toast which are quickly mellowed out by sweet notes of hazelnut, toffee, milk chocolate and caramel. A bit too carbonated for my loony but this beer improves with warmth, becoming more smooth and balanced with a slightly creamy lactic presence. Probably the most complex Biere de Garde I've had.","corby112","0"
