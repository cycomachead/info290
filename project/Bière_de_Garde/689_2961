While not a Pumpkin beer, this had the feel one one in certain aspects without being overly spicy or heavy tot he taste. If there was a bit of champagne yeast in this, it wouldn't surprise me as this had a light feel to it from start to finish. This was wonderful stuff that put a smile on my face and proved to me that more U.S. brewers should give this style a go and while not as potent or full as something imported here, Two Brothers had a winner here that's sure to offend no one.

4.1,7.6,4,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer is slightly hazy, with a deep amber body and a reddish cast beneath a short but creamy head of white foam. The nose is offers a combination of delicately toasty and straw-like grain with caramel and slight fruitiness. The body is medium-light with a zesty, very-fine bubbled carbonation. The flavor starts with bold, toasty and caramel malts upfront, followed by a splash of fruit (sour cherry, tangerine, plum) that fades into a rather dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light. The beer reminds me of a toastier and drier Irish ale. I loved it.","chickenflea","Jun 22, 2014"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/29/2014. Pours fairly cloudy copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, pear, apple, biscuit, floral, grass, pepper, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and compexity of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, grass, pepper, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, grass, and pepper on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with a crisp malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Biere de Garde style! All around good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

But 2 Bro is a pleasant change to my recent beersperation so to speak.. I may review again after a 2nd try, but this French Country entry is good. Just not sure it's where my beer mind is wandering..

3.64,-4.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"a strange brew here, to dial up a classic rock reference this morning. French style country ale, was I naïve to think this was going to be a saison? it pours a surprising maple amber color, with only a little cloudiness, and a very short lived white head. it doesn't look or smell like any saison ive seen, instead emitting aromas of coppery toasted barley and an acidic wine like ester that must come from the yeast. the flavor isn't so abstract, its pretty much an amber ale on the malt front, sweeter, a tad dry, and caramel or toffee teasing. the yeast makes this interesting, but it doesn't totally work, green apple tartness, and a funny complexity that seems an accident, like the odd mix of smells in well used dishwater, rather than a meticulously honed fine ale. still, the final product doesn't taste bad at all, its just a style of beer I wasn't expecting, and I am not sure what it is, it seems quite far from the traditional biere de gardes of the world. it needed more carbonation, and the sweetness was an out of place last note. I did enjoy this beer in retrospect, but it was confusing and challenging to me at the same time. I will look for more from two brothers.","StonedTrippin","Jul 11, 2013"

Having learned my lesson with an earlier iteration of the style, I went with a kinder, gentler pour on this one. I ended up with a finger of foamy, deep-tan head that quickly fell away to wisps. Color was an elegant deep-amber, close to copper, with NE-quality clarity. Speaking of Nebraska, I recently got turned onto (both literally and figuratively) Val MidWest, a young lady from Lincoln who has an adult website and recently made news when she returned to her Catholic high school for an after-hours photo shoot! The nose on this was was really sweet, almost syrupy in its intensity with an underlying scent of dried dark fruits. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unexpectedly less sweet than I had anticipated. Instead, it had a fruity quality, almost like fruitcake. In fact, that is exactly what it reminded me of with its bready, malty backbone to accompany the fruitiness! Wild. Finish was semi-sweet and actually quite refreshing in its reserved nature. This had the potential to be an over-the -top malt bomb but the masterful use of the yeast really worked well with the malt. I would recommend giving this a try.","woodychandler","Jun 12, 2013"

3.71,-2.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D/O: This beer's marketing is very era-appropriate--ten years ago, it would have been labeled an "amber" without another look, but now the label seeks to appeal to our burgeoning awareness of the table beers bearing some nebulous nationality. In all truth, any comparison to New Belgium's ubiquitous Fat Tire ale is appropriate, but the comparer must admit that this is re-tooled with an eye toward depth. The two beers are similar, and both are probably equally approachable and user-friendly. The difference is the real depth present here, with layers of roast and umami underneath the heavy biscuit that makes this so much more repeatable.","beagle75","Aug 28, 2011"

3.91,2.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"OVERALL: You don’t see a Biere de Garde every day, especially from an American brewer, but Two Brothers, as usual, did something a little unusual with this brew and it works very well. It is slightly on the sweet side for me these days, and I’m not sure I could knock down more than a couple in one sitting because of that, but to have one or two is certainly a treat.","StoneTSR","Jul 01, 2011"

It produced a nice white head and had average lacing. The aroma of the beer was sweet, smelled of fresh baked bread and had a hint of spice that I can't put my finger on. The aroma was wonderful. One of the best smelling beers that I have ever had. The taste was malty, a little bready, slightly dry and had notes of raisins and pear. There was some bitterness from hops that melded with the other flavors. Very complex beer. Awesome, I will be looking for this again. In fact a road trip might be in order.","GossageBrewery","Jun 18, 2011"
3.43,-10,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O: A fair introduction to an uncommon style. I don’t think this will ever become one of my favorite types of beer, but who knows?

Rich caramel malty notes prevelant throught, really making a difference here, The flavor was very smooth with a rich sweet character coming through and balanced well against a dark fruity yeast character. Nice notes of pums and raisins throughout this one, really offering quite a bit of depth here. As it warmed a bit of spicy rum like flavor cae out with a touch of peppery like alcohol, but very nicely done. Very smooth texture and very highly carbonated, this as definitly a good choice here.

I wonder what this would be like with food for two reasons: 1) the rubber-rubbing after-feel might disappear with a meal, and 2) the taste might seem even weaker than it does here (and I haven't eaten for about three hours). At 5.9%, it could be a good one with which to begin an evening of moderate debauchery (as opposed to heavy or even wild debauchery, obviously).

4.2,10.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Not a beer style ventured into by many American brewers. A crisp-looking ale, clear brassy color with a tight, tiny-bubbled lacing. Candied fruit, white chocolate, shortbread, mild spice and wildflowers blow all expectations out of the water ... a godly aroma. Dried malt character blankets the palate, a bit biscuity but more of a dried grass flavor. Fruitiness abounds with hints of pear cider, baked apples and golden raisins, with a hint of alcohol within. Bubblegum? Herbal hop flavor and a small measure of bitterness checks any sweetness that may have lingered.

4.35,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours dark amber- dark for the style, but with a fine white head that sticks around for awhile and leaves some nice lacing. Smells a bit grainy, like brown bread with some earthy hops and some brown sugar glazed pears. The taste is very nice- quite balanced with some slightly sweet grainy malt, some notes of banana and pear, and some more earthy hops as well as a touch of brandied citron on the end that intermingles nicely with the long somewhat bitter earthiness. Very smooth and silky in the mouth, with just a touch of tartness. A very nice beer- can't believe its taken me this long to try it.","Georgiabeer","Dec 24, 2010"

It's a great burger with roasted fresh Jalapenos peppers folded into 1/2 pound of awesome beef. It's the best way to spend an afternoon on a cold winter day in Chicago.","BTK480","Dec 23, 2010"

Very rich tasting, spicy and buttery flavors going down with a malty grain/brown sugar feeling in the aftertaste. Hops are noticeable but drowned out by the syrup on the tongue. Not sure I'd rush out for more of this brew. This is a unique beer that I might have to develop a taste for compared to what I usually drink. ABV is on the high side and the alcohol is up front.

Flavor really hits with the sweetness upfront with caramel malt some heavy grainy Wheaties like flavors with semi bitter finish with some citrusand herbal hops carrying through in the finish. I get a nice fruity refreshing quality the whole time with a dry yeast and mild spiced finish. A really nice sessionable ale that packs massive layers of flavor, mouthfeel overall is smooth carbonation is moderate and natural body pulls off at least a medium ranking without overdoing any one area very balanced. Drinkability is sound in all regards I wish these guys would be more readily available for me, this Domaine DuPage was like a nice piece of crusted bread buttered perfectly with herbs sprinkled on top it was simplistic and perfect for the experience it's trying to pull off.","WVbeergeek","Dec 10, 2009"

The nose is malty, a bit of apple. The taste is sweet malt with enough hop bite to give it legs. I detect a bit of flowery flavors and dare I say bubble gum?The mouth feel is sticky enough that it may discourage you from drinking it in the sun, but feels appropriate for shoulder seasons.

Anyhoo, what I could detect was some sweet malt, faint fruity esters, and some flowery noble hops. Taste is bursting with some awesome toasted malt with a slightly fruity sweetness of plum, cherry, and brown sugar. Those flowery noble hops have a moderate flavor and blend nicely with the malt but leave only a slight hop bitterness on the tongue.

The taste is a nice rich caramel malt, brown bread, honey, a touch of grassy hops in the end. The feel is moderate with some prickly carbonation, yet it remains quite a smooth beer. It is a tad slick but the hop bitterness help counter balance that. This is a fine malty brew. A very nice caramel malt that is quite smooth. Definitely worth a purchase.","Gmann","Jul 03, 2008"

Seems a bit thin and carbonation seems just a step up from being flat. I really wanted to score this beer higher but looking at the individual scores, it doesn't do any of them well.

This also means no lacing Not sure if this is typical of the style, being my first one, but very underwhelming in appearance. Smell is super malty, bready and slightly fruity. The aroma on this thing is near perfection. Caramel goodness throughout the nose. Taste follows suit. Biscuit malts, nice caramel flavors, the slightest amount of hops in the background and very sweet to the tastebuds. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with little carbonation, but the carbonation that does pop up tingles the tongue. Alcohol is not overly-present at 5.9%. I really enjoyed this beer.

Overall the taste is a bit on the weak side. Mouthfeel/body is a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth and not hard to drink. I don't recall having a beer of this style before, so I son't really have anything else to compare it to. I can't say it's one of my favorites, but it's not bad.

Taste was not what I expected - slightly more malt than hops, but also tasted a little skunky.

When it warmed up, still nothing else emerged from the background of the smell. It had a light and mild taste of toasted malts, some juicy fruits, tame toasted citrus hops, and then finished off with a small dab of sweet caramel. There weren't many tastes in the taste department, but what was there made for a better than average taste. I would have to say the mouthfeel is on the light side with a soft aftertaste of toasted malts and a few juicy fruits.

Biscuit and light caramel malt flavors dominate at first, then more tawny malt flavors express themselves, along with a bit of an alcoholic bite that suggests something stronger than 5.9 percent.

Sweetish and malty in the nose, a bit of sugary sweetness, fairly well balnced. To the sweet side, with weaker floral hops. Smells kinda old, with prevalent honey and the dulled hops, although the bottle is within code. None of the funky barn smell I associate with Biere de Garde, much more like a sweeter saison. Pretty tame. Kind of an apple pie aroma, with doughy, muddy, caramel belgian malt and appley esters. Not quite what I'd wanted, but not at all unpleasant. The flavor starts out apple pie-like. Clean clover honey, golden caramel and granny smith apple dominate the flavor. Sweet with a touch of belgian yeast spice. A bit of a floral, spicy bite of hops in the finish, though very mild. Mostly driven by the malt and yeast character. I can't help but feel this is about 6 months expired, sans the surge of carbonation. Good, but not as impressive as others of the style, or others from the same brewery. My weakest experience with Two Bros. so far. Sessionable, in the way that there's not a lot going on and you can keep sipping. Softer carbnation aids in the experience, with a fullish body. I'd probably want just one or two before opting for something else, though. After relating it to apple pie, that's pretty much the gist of it. Let me tell you, there's a lot worse than being compared to apple pie, especially when we're talking about american beer.","UnionMade","Aug 18, 2006"

The finish is a suttle hop bitter aftertaste with a somewhat floural watery mouthfeel. Pretty decent overall, I love the different flavor for this saison.","Franchise","Mar 15, 2006"
3.85,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Medium copper body with golden edges and a small, off-white head. Toasted grains on the nose with light fruity sweetness. A bit of spice in there too (grains of paradise?). Not much else. Toasted bitterness up front. Fruity malt with singed notes follows and mixes with light whiskey and wood flavors. Interesting. Finish shows tangier/tarter sides of the fruit and resonant toasted, slightly floral, bitterness. Medium to light bodied with a slightly sticky, nicely carbonated feel. Not bad and the tartness mixed with caramel/bread is different than any beer I've had lately.","alexgash","Mar 10, 2006"
3,-21.3,3,3,3,3,3,"This is a saison? I guess brewers can do whatever they want to a style, and I'm all for experimentation, but this beer doesn't fit into any category really, and it's certainly not a saison. A bit of an identity crisis here. Pours a dark, stained-wood amber, kind of nice actually, but with no head at all. If I had to place a style label on this one, I'd lump it in as an ESB or English Ales in general. Full of toffee, carmel, and buttery notes, with a fairly quiet hop profile. Decently malty, but lost. Once again, definitely not a saison in my book. Chewy mouthfeel, kind of slick. Well, it does have a few redeeming qualities, but it's nothing more than a mild amber with a saison label on it. Who knows though, you might like it. Two Brothers do a great job in general, this one just needs a little work I'd say.","twelvsies","Mar 01, 2006"

The taste is a mix of malty, bready sweetness with tartness. Fleeting acidity. Medium body. Yeast flavors come out in the taste, as the beer warms.

No real head to speak of on my pour at least. The smell is malty with some caramel and dare I say vinegar tones coming through. I can also detect a hint of hops, but it is definetly not upfront in any way. Quite a unique smell, this being my first tasting of the biere de garde style. The first sip is interesting...almost has a sour aspect to it. Hints of caramel and grape/plum come through along with a slight hint of vinegar. On the back palate I can taste some hops, which helps bring this together nicely. It's a little much for me personally. The mouthfeel is very light and airy...with a decent amount of carbonation. As far as drinkability...I don't think I'd have too many of these in one sitting, but I may come back to it again because it's so different from everything else I have tried.

4.25,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Two Brothers Domaine DuPage delivers a slightly hazy, deep amber body with a reddish cast beneath a short but creamy head of white foam that holds quite well and leaves some thin lace about the glass. The nose is offers a comination of delicately toasty and straw-like grain with subtle notes of caramel alongside some soft summer fruit (apple, peach, cherry) and musty yeast. It's quite intriguing! The body is medium-light with a zesty, very-fine bubbled natural carbonation that finely pricks the tongue. The flavor starts with bold, toasty and caramelish malts upfront, followed by a splash of tart fruit (sour cherry, tangerine, plum) that fades into the finish. The tartnes is quite nice and refreshing, and it slowly fades in the finish, giving rise to some lingering toasty malt, a delicate spiciness, and finally a drying chalkiness that brings you full circle and ready for another sip. Given a chance, this is an exciting, fairly complex, refreshing, and satisfying beer that probably deserves much more recognition than it receives.

This is reminiscent of some French Biere De Garde style ales, but to me, this does not have the malt complexities, or spicy hop profile that most French ales of this nature have.

Incipient in flavor is a combination of sourdough bread and orange zest. Tartness continues in an underripe tangerine and kumquat nature. Green pineapple hints. Sweetness augments as the beer warms, but remains as a subdued, honeyish presence. Highly carbonated initially, with a prickly carbonic bite. Eventually lightly dextrinous in mouthfeel. Trace clove surfaces after a deliberation. Musty, slightly cheesy yeast derived undertone adds token "farmhouse" character. Finishes minerally and slightly chalky, with citrus rind hints fading. A unique, albeit somewhat rough brew that would be an interesting one to cellar for a few months.

Normally the hops wouldn't show through so much in a French ale. But this one is so thin, one-dimensional, and uninteresting up front that the hops in the finish end up overbalancing the whole affair. Also, certain elements that should be invogorating somehow manage to fall flat. The carbonation doesn't feel very interesting or lively; it's there, but it somehow feels dead. During the finish the woody tannins languish on my tongue in a rather uninspiring way. I won't be bothering with any more of this.","Weissenheimer","Dec 31, 2003"

3.01,-21,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Burnt orange in color..barely any head...soft malty nose...a little thin in the mouth...not real familiar with this style,so it's tough to rate...toasty malt tones, but they are faint...dry finish...I'm glad I tried it but not a beer style I would seek out again..","ZAP","Jul 19, 2002"
4.42,16,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a clear deep amber with a somewhat truncated head that splits off into islands of thin bubbly froth.  Something weird, but nice, in the aroma.  Like Rosemary or Sage or something.  I think it's Rosemary.  (I had a Farmhouse ale that used Rosemary at PizzaPort in Solona Beach, CA, and this seems similar to that.)  This beer is a real refreshing change from all of the typical beer styles.  It is very nice.  Not often do you find French Style Country Ales available at the local package store.  Thus, I'm having a hard time describing the taste.  I would say it has quite a unique herbal quality.  A healthy dose of grainy notes.  And a nice bitter hop finish.  Easy drinking for 5.9 a/v.  Damn good beer.","Bighuge","Jun 14, 2002"
