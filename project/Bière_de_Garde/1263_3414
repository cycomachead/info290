Pours extremely cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off-white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, pear, apple, grape, honey, floral, herbal, clove, pepper, bread, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt with fruity/spicy ester notes. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, grape, honey, bread, floral, herbal, clove, pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, honey, bread, floral, herbal, clove, pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy ester flavors with moderate hop earthiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Biere de Garde style! All around great balance and complexity of malt with fruity/spicy esters and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2013"

4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"La Bavaisienne pours somewhere between a light brown and a dark orange, and it's completely hazy. There's a solid three fingers plus of bone white head that slowly creeps down the glass, leaving plenty of footprints behind. The nose is redolent of apples and herbs and caramel. It smells like some kind of apple cider that was sweetened up a bit with caramel syrup. The flavor sees the caramel notes take a bit of a backseat to apples and general fruity notes on the sweet side. The earthy/herbal notes are also a bit more prominent. The beer tastes like walking through an apple orchard on a farm. The body is beguilingly light for how prominent the malty/sweet flavors are in this beer. The carbonation is just about perfectly dialed in, enough to cut through the sweet flavors of the beer and place some emphasis on the herbal notes, but still doesn't distract from the rest of the beer. La Bavaisienne is a great example of a style I don't drink all that often, and it's a beer I'll look to come back to in the future.","axeman9182","Jan 12, 2011"

3.52,-13.7,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"I admit that I don't care for Biere de Garde nearly as much as I care for Saison. Biere de Garde always seems less complex, less "farmhouse ale" to me. It is like the farms of France all got together and decided, in the face of bewilderingly complex Belgian Saison, that they would all brew something a lot like Rare Vos. That said, I have had better biers de garde than La Bavaisienne. Chalk this one up as a disappointment, solid beer though it is.","Reaper16","Mar 06, 2010"

Color is a very slightly hazy medium amber. Aroma is yeast malt a little hop spice. Flavor's like aroma and I pick up a short sour tang in the front. And then again just a bit at the end.

Soft and a little mellow from age, some typical oxidized Belgian character that keeps it from being great. Minor earthy hop flavor in the aftertaste lending some needed bitterness.

The aroma is of lemon and green apple skins, some farmhouse funk, mineral water and caramel. Nice earthy caramel malt flavor, some honey sweetness followed by a metallic note. Some light farmhouse flavors peak through and ends with a grassy hop bitterness. Moderate body with plenty of carbonation; sweet overall but finishes with bitter bite. A little sticky. This is a very good biere de garde. It just tastes like a craft beer. Nice art work on the bottle. Highly recommended","Gmann","0"

The taste is also on the sweet side, but well balanced. No real funk or sour presence to speak of. Not super complex, but a tasty ale indeed. The medium body is well carbonated but perhaps a bit thin. Nice classic example of the style.","rye726","Nov 16, 2008"

4.48,9.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Great, happy looking off-white head greets the eye. Lasts to a nice film of foam atop a very dark, rusty amber. You can only see the bubbling at the bottom of the glass or on the edges of the beer. Very hazey. This beer looks awesome. Very inviting toasted melba toast malts mixed with some soft rosemary and thyme. Maybe some caramel notes in the nose as well. The taste starts with mild toasted barely and a grain palate. This slowly develops to a much sweeter malt bill. Caramel and some honey do the waltz with mildy herbal hops. Tastes like a European field in Spring at about 7 a.m. Leaves a toasted caramel aftertaste in the mouth. Great yeast profile gives notes of fresh fruit still on the vine.","scruffwhor","Jun 11, 2008"

That massive head is really genius, as I'd otherwise have gulped this bottled down in like 20 mins! Perfect pairing with this thick, spicy chili, although after that was gone, the robustness of the flavor slowed me down some.

Very drinkable, and I suspect this goes really well with food.","Sephiroth","Dec 25, 2006"
4.43,8.6,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours lightly-clouded chestnut with streaming carbonation, very persistent thick creamy head and clinging lace. Smells peppery and nutty, with strong bitter orange and moist earth notes. The aroma is interesting but not immediately appetizing. The flavor, on the other hand, is completely unexpected and out of this world. Deeply toasted biscuit malts exhibit lovely nutty qualities. The medium-sweet malt becomes peppery and hoppy at the end, finishing with orange notes and yeasty earthiness. The taste is an appealing and unusual blend of British ESB and a more traditional biere de garde. Medium-thick body with big carbonation and balancing creaminess. Exceptionally drinkable and well-worth finding!","dgallina","Dec 12, 2006"

3.96,-2.9,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Originally reviewed on September 18, 2006. 750 mL. Faint champagne apple malts dance from the heavy carbonation of this beaut. Really not getting too much aroma though. Pour of beautiful fired amber, with a rocky ivory head. Flavor is a ridiculous amalgam of sweet full grain flavors, like Ive rarely experienced. Theres a variety of farm-like sweet candy grains and full rounds of light fruits. The malts are especially syrupy feeling, but the beer is in no way cloying. Instead, a gentle swashing of freshly roasted grain husks and tawny edges of apple brandy. Its damn delicious for sure. The yeast character seems subdued to a bready faint existence, despite the omnipresent appearance in the bottle. A smidge of hop dust in the backend draw balanced. I guess overall, Im dissapointed by the lack of aroma, but extremely satisfied with the skillful and delicate malting of this beer. It reaches German standards and is a beer that really lets these malty nuances stand and shout for themselves. Smoother than hell, too. I could see how people might think this is bland, but they might not have refined palates.","CharlesDarwin","Nov 27, 2006"

Medium to high carbonisationlevel fitting the brew and overall smooth mouthfeel despite bitterness that's maybe quiet high for a biere de garde but is this one or more an IPA-clone.

Once I find my favorite beer in a category, I tend to stick with it, but the article and the disappearance of 3 Monts from NJ, provided a great opportunity to go asearching. This beer is one of the classics, with tremendous flavor and complexity. I consider this more a saison/bière de garde than a Belgian Strong Ale and put this near the top of that category, surpassed by 3 Monts, Southamptons French Country, Heavyweights Bière dArte, and La Choulette. I intend to revisit many of these classics in the months to come. Definitely worth seeking out and still a great value.

But the bitterness seems to fade as I drink it, so it could have been something to do with the temperature. Definitely gets better as it warms.","aracauna","Nov 14, 2004"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer shows a ligher shade of scarlet red. Clarity is good. Vigorous carbonation is noted. And a huge crop of off white head. Impressive looking. Nose is interesting. Some funky barnyard and horsey aromas, though not as strong as say Cantillon. Musty cellars. Yeast sediment. Earthy dirt tones. Herbal. Pretty good. While this beer has a definite dry quality to it, there's a ghostly sweet aspect that is very alluring. The beer is very earthy. It's all about the farmhouse qualities... the hay, the barn, the horse blanket. It's not real acidic or tart, but definitely yeasty and musty. Like a cellar. This is really enjoyable and disappearing way too fast.","Bighuge","Nov 01, 2004"
4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours clear copper in appearance with a rocky off-white head. The aroma is malty, spicy, and peppery. The flavor is bready, and malty. It is also a bit sweet, and has a light fruitiness. The body is medium, and it is easy drinking. A very tasty brew, would have another.","BeerBuilder","Oct 12, 2004"
4.71,15.4,5,4,5,4.5,5,"Great orange-amber body. Eternally lasting 1-inch foam. Very deep aroma although never aggressive. Makes you feels like youre the one who is lucky to study it and not the subject that is lucky to be studied. You ar lucky to smell this and must offer proper efforts to grasp that terrific rusty character that is hard to pinpoint, but offers such a subtle earthiness to compensate those wet hay flavours and mild hops that seems to have a german origin as unlikely as it is (styrians?). Rather complex when you dig it with the perfect level of sweetness. Palate is a killer, just the right yeast character, perfectly peaking through the copious rustic flavours (basement, hay, wet cask wood, must etc.) Very dry finish, malty. Delicious, one that has you sucking your tongue afterwards. Highly drinkable, splendid spongy texture, foamy, hiding its high carbonation through an unreal quaffability I must concur with the general opinion that this thrones the bière de garde styleBig props to JPDipso!","Rastacouere","Sep 13, 2004"
4.6,12.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Smells damn good. 58F. Beautiful walnut color. Little fuzz on top doesnt hang around to long. Rich malt aroma with side notes of hay. Yummy bread flavor with the thinnest spread of homemade currant jelly. A bit of chewing gum, some fresh alfalfa strands, and grass. Ill tell you what, I could drink buckets of this. The malt hangs around the palate like a street corner quartet providing a pleasant buzz to the proceedings. And this beer proceeds to impress me with layers of grassy hops, and I'm gonna love you malt. It's totally relaxed, not overtly farmy barmy, though there's a little of that mustiness. Balanced. Session on.","gbontrag","Aug 18, 2004"
4.67,14.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"750ml bottle: Sampled at the CTRiver Brewers Festival. This one poured an orangish-golden color. There wasnt a lot of head on it. The aroma was quite nice. There was floral notes, as well as some fruits and spiciness. The taste is very complex, and has a dryness and spiciness to it. Really an excellent beer!","Boto","Jul 28, 2004"
4.16,2,5,4,4,5,4,"Hmm...judging by what the label says this should be re-classified as a biere de garde, so I'll review it as such. The label also descrbes La Bavaisienne as a malty, hoppy, amber ale -- and this is true -- but it's so much more. This beer pours with a fine bead of carbonation and lasting head of bright white foam. An aroma of new mown hay bursts forth, tinged with mineral-like notes. This mineral content is echoed on the palate. his medium-bodied ale has a soft mouthfeel despite it's high carbonation. I would go so far to describe the mouthfeel as being quite plush. This ale gets a bit snappy and crisp towards this finish with a late burst of lightly spicy hops amid honey-biscuit malt flavors. The finish is fairly dry for the style with a slight bit sweetness left on the tongue. An exceptional biere de garde, or strong pale ale, whichever you want to call it.","marcobrau","Jun 28, 2004"
4.18,2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a pretty, clear, copper color. It is well carbonated and supports a prodigious tan head. The aroma is sharp and spicy with some herbal notes as well as some malty ones too. The aroma is a good marriage between malt, hops, and yeast aromatics. My first impression of the taste is that this definitely hits the spot. It is light and flavorful, perfect for a hot summer evening. This has some nice sharp spicy notes that hit the front of my tongue; these are a nice balance to the malty sweetness that is also found in this beer. The malty sweetness has a depth of flavor, which really contributes to the overall character of this beer. I get flavor notes that are spicy, herbal, sweet and a certain caramel maltiness. While I would be hesitant to call this a stellar beer, the integrated flavors really meld very well together. This is certainly a well crafted beer, and one which I highly recommend.","Gueuzedude","Jun 15, 2004"

4.41,8.1,5,4,4.5,3.5,5,"Clear deep bronze hue. Towering, animated, dogged, ivory white head supported by capacious bubble threads. Steadfast, frothy lace. Gorgeous. Wafts of lightly tart starfruit and underripe red apple prevalent in aroma. Subdued light toffee and sugar cookie hints. Trace orange mint and moist hay hints. Well rounded aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a combination of orange flesh and sweet biscuit. Dries promptly, with hop bitterness, black pepper hints and woody hop hints ensuing. Stately lime and kiwi hints. Persistent light caramel malt backbone. Fruitiness oddly diminishes as it breathes, with mild horsey, earthy tones replacing esters. Moderate in body, with ample dextrinous girth. Finishes both savory and dry, with airy sourdough hints. Delicious. So soft, yet so satiating. Superbly crafted and superlatively drinkable.","marc77","Apr 08, 2004"
3.92,-3.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer after divorcing the 750ml green bottle settles in the glass a bright clear amber color, the head is Bunyanesque in size, the texture semi-creamy, as it slowly erodes, and the lace forms a thick and sticky blanket to seal off the glass from view. Nose is somewhat sweet, a tad earthy and maybe a hint of over ripe apples to seal off the nose, start is lightly sweet with a nice malt presence, the top fair to middling in its feel. Finish is light to moderate in carbonation, with a spicy hop presence and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. As you pour each glass, the head pops right up to the top of the glass, a very interesting brew!","Gusler","Beers"
4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Found this beer for the first time at Colonial Spirits in Acton. Cool green 750 that is capped but not corked. Label says, "from France's oldest working brewery". Pours out and orange-brown color with a nice white fluffy head. The smell is grassy and malty. Very effervesant. Taste is similar and extremely smooth. Malty and sweet in the beginning then crisp and hoppy in the end. Very well balanced. A unique style that I am growing to love. If France has more beers like this, we could mend fences even faster:)","CharlesRiver","0"

4.27,4.7,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Amber-brown in colour with a healthy head. Wonderful strong, earthy, peaty aroma. Pleasant malty flavour, a bit spicy, bordering on sweet but balanced out by other flavours; slightly buttery texture. Balanced, malty finish. Recommended.","Imbiber","Jun 14, 2003"
4.47,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A great find! Kristal clear amber color with a soft white, thick pillow of foam that leaves scattered splotches and retains well. Aromas are peppery, assertively hoppy, mildly honeyed, and are balanced by rich, toasty malted notes. The mouthfeel is full, crisp, very smooth, and just buzzes with hop bitter. This is rather like the Saison Dupont in style though it has more of a piney hop character and perhaps a deeper malt component. The balance here is astounding.The long hoppy finish lingers and is enveloped by just the right amount of malt sweetness. This is a hard to put down, really well made beer. Thanks again to Ron at Shelton Bros. for another stellar sample! Are these Bros. not putting together one of the most exciting portfolios on the market or what?!","moulefrite","May 22, 2003"
4.1,0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This pours a slightly hazy pale amber color with a long lasting frothy head. It has lots of carbonation, but uncharacteristically, add to the drinking experience, rather than distracting from it. It has a slightly thick feel on the tongue with a subtle sweetness. The aroma has a touch of apple in it. In my opinion, this beer has a lot of small & subtle tastes & smells that add up to a very nice beer.","jcalabre","Nov 09, 2002"
