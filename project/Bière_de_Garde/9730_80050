3.17,-19.1,3.75,3,3.25,3.25,3,"M&O: moderately effervescent, medium-minus bodied, the flavour profile is intended to be complex but the result is a messy beer where the esters rein freely, hops fail to compete despite so much effort invested (3 hop varieties?) and the attenuation level could’ve been tuned higher to render a better drinkability. I really find very little to like about this beer, so will not try it again for sure.","wl0307","Sep 14, 2013"

Overall this is a tasty bier with some nice yeast components in the flavor with mild maltiness and fruitiness making for an interesting belgian ale. I would recommend this if you enjoy the style.","Slatetank","Aug 20, 2013"

Only faint bitterness. Alcohol is mild. Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. Overall, this is an average, everyday table beer.

3.8,-3.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Very nice - tasty and balanced. It looks good, with a predominantly yeasty aroma/flavour illuminated by subtle aromatic hop notes. The body is great; it glides over the palate like silk. The influence of Belgium and the US are discernible, with a yeast profile that reminds me of a Belgian blonde and hopping that recalls an American pale ale. A solid effort that goes down almost too easily; worthy of your time if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Apr 19, 2013"

4.03,2.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice to see France getting in on the American-influenced beers (along with Britain and Belgium) - this is pitched as an IPA/biere de garde hybrid. Three hops in here (from 3 continents, apparently), and I'm guessing there's both traditional and US in there, along with NZ tropical fruit. Adds up to a multi-layered hop kick which, together with a very soft body, makes this very easy to drink and a great dinner table beer.","StJamesGate","Nov 08, 2012"

Who knew the French make some pretty great beers besides wine. This Belgian IPA pours like a typical IPA with some medium carbonation. Smell was right on with American craft IPA with hints of hops and taste was hoppy but not overwhelming so probably IBU in middle of the pack. Overall this IPA is one I like but my local beer store does not carry it.","beerbuddy11735","Jun 07, 2012"
