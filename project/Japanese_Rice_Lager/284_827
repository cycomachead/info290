3.11,6.1,3.75,2.75,3.25,3.25,3,"I intended to review this beer at Tsunami Sushi & Asian Cuisine, but since they gave away my Valentines Day reservation (bastards!) I had to settle for a can from Publix. By the way, bonus points for the insanely sturdy can. If I ever get in to a bar fight, screw the bottles, give me a Sapporo! The beer doesn't have the same constitution as the can though. It's comparable to your average domestic macro lager. Pours with a transparent, fizzy yellow-water appearance with active carbonation and several inches of nice, frothy, snow-white foam. Quality lacing remains as the snow cap cover gradually melts away. The mild, unoffensive aroma whispers of soft grain. Not much going on in the nose. Traces of hops, and perhaps a touch of fruitiness. Super clean. The first sip has me thinking of cork. A husky cork-like flavor and a little woody accent ride over mild malt sweetness. A bit dry, with an interesting complimentary bitterness. Nicely balanced with a clean finish that hints at white rice in the aftertaste. Adequate body and carbonation produce a light but respectable texture. This would have been the perfect palate cleanser to the shrimp tempura that I never got to eat.","JohnnyI","Mar 01, 2015"

The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, subtle banana, and very subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was not really anything to get excited about. This is basically the BMC of Japan I'm guessing and it lets you know this with similar flavors.

It's diminished substantially since I poured it, but it's still leaving a good layer on the top of the body. The body is piss yellow and completely see through, it looks like a standard macro lager, accept for the decent lacing. Overall not a very good look, but the lacing is nice. There is some crisp hop on the nose, along with a sweet and sour malty smell. Smells like a lager, but one tiny step above the rest because I can get some hops on the nose. Overall the smell is very faint, but it smells decent when I can smell it. Yeah, there is for sure a nice hop character in this beer, when you compare it to a budwieser or some macro beer like that. It's a pretty small hop flavor, but that's really ok, because it's a lager. Overall the flavor is pretty simple, there is for sure a malt flavor, and on some sips you pick up significant alcohol, considering it's only 5%. You can tell the beer is made with rice, but really it doesn't bother me because it's not like they are trying to cut cost, that's just the style, where as when it's used in an american macro, they are trying to cut cost, and it doesn't work with the beer. Mouthfeel is decent, pretty thin and a little watery, but the carbonation is just perfect. The drinkability is pretty damn nice too, there really isn't anything wrong with this beer, so it's not hard to drink, and it's pretty light. Overall, I good lager, and since it's mass produced, a very good macro lager. Not an amazing beer, but one I wouldn't mind having, especially over a normal macro lager.","MaltsOfGlory","May 02, 2011"

It has a very light weight smell to it and lightweight taste, as well. A tiny bit of biscuit (I think, personally) an a light carbonation which accounts for its drinkability. This stuff is almost thirst quenching. I can chug this stuff with no problem. If you're wanting a deep, flavourful beer you can drink and pick apart, get something from Bavaria. If you want a cold beer you guzzle, but don't want some mainstream foolishness like Bud or Coors, grab a Sapporo.","SilentSabre","Dec 09, 2003"

Less malt taste to come through, which makes me think of adjuncts. Sure enough, the taste is gone as soon as I swallow. I suppose it would go good with food, but so would an instant iced tea. Draft should imply that its filtered instead of pasteurized, but I get none of that here.

It had a slightly, and not at all unpleasantly, euro-lager taste, but it still had the euro-lager taste, with what I thought was more than its own fair share of adjuncts. On the other hand, it was crisp, light, and helped wash down the day old turkey. As good a lager as you’ll see outside of Germany, and better than their macro-imports, Czech, and most of Eastern Europe. (in other words, it eats henie/becks/budmillercoors for lunch).","jackndan","Nov 30, 2002"

Sour, and grainy smells, but somewhat pleasant and appealing. Carbonation was a bit highly charged but did not overwhelm the very adequate sweet malty taste. Super clean and crisp taste paired great with spicy Chinese Food. Decent shot of bitterness in mid taste, then a sweet balanced finish. Nothing lingers, very refreshing and a great choice with Japanese or spicy Chines food. Easy going, well balanced, and compliments food nicely.","StevieW","Nov 09, 2002"
3.42,16.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"To the best of my ability, I've only ever been able to find the "Original" draft beer in a 22 oz. can. I've often wondered if it's the same beer that comes in the sharp looking embossed bottle with the shiny black & two-color gold label. The can advertises ceramic filtration, but the bottles only say "cold filtered"... all beer is filtered cold! So I did a side by side tasting. The color and head retention appear to be the same, although the beer from the can is slightly hazy (and may have to do with the age of the sample). The light "beer" aroma appears to be the same with the exception that there may be a little skunkiness in the bottled sample. The flavor also appears to be the same, although the mouthfeel of the canned beer is a little smoother. So, in conclusion, it's my belief that if there is any difference between the two beers it's simply in filtration and packaging. A decent beer, but nothing special.","NeroFiddled","Nov 05, 2002"

I really didn't like this beer but after reading the other reveiws I think that maybe it was a bad can of it.  The flavor was not very good and it certainly wasn't dry.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish the can.  I have to say that I was drinking this while eating chinese food that was not good and it may have effected my opinion of the beer as well as it kind of made the whole ordeal unappetizing (sp?).
