Aroma of sweet malt with light sweet apple juice and a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is light sweet malt with a minerally bitterness that eventually resolves as light grassy hops. An unusual light bland sweetness that may be the rice components. Light bodied. A pleasant light lager that is milder and slightly sweeter than a domestic adjunct lager. Bland and harmless, tasted pretty good on a hot summer day. My one hundredth style on BA.","LiquidAmber","Jul 08, 2014"

3.88,29.3,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Poured a clear pale yellow with a one finger fluffy white head that quickly dissipated to a thin ring of lacing. It's not the best looking beer, but it's very true to the style. Scents of lager yeast, some moderate hop character, and grainy malt. Flavor begins with a moderate level of floral hop bitterness and some grainy malt in the background. This moves into more nice dry grainy malt flavors with a balance of floral hop bitterness. Finish is dry with a nice grainy dryness and floral hop bitterness. Aftertaste is dry with floral hop flavors. A nice flavor profile, quite dry, grainy and with a good level of hop bitterness. Quite pleasant to drink as a result. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a drying feel. Very refreshing, easy to drink and wonderful on a warm day. Overall this is a good Japanese Rice Lager that has a nice dry flavor character, a classic aroma profile for the style and a wonderfully refreshing mouthfeel. It's not the best beer around, but for it's style it is a fantastic drink.","Auraan","May 11, 2014"
3.21,7,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Pours a nice golden with a nice white head. Not much aroma. This is a typical Japanese beer that is light and easy to drink, especially with Japanese food like yakitori.

The flavor is a touch sweet, with a bit of grain and a touch of something resembling hops. This is a super light beer, very light in body and flavor. It's as light or lighter than any macro American light beer. That said, it's about as good as any beer I've had that fits that category. Btw, the cap says "For your happy time."

3,0,3,3,3,3,3,"My pour did not lack for head! I had better than two fingers' worth of dense bone-white head with great retention. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a clean lager-sweetness to its scent. I am beginning to understand why not all adjuncts are bad - just corn. Mouthfeel was tending toward full, kind of light and fluffy on the tongue with a pleasant lager sweetness in the mouth. Finish had a real dryness to it which was both unexpected and enjoyable. I may be jaded after so many AALs in support of The CANQuest (TM), but I found this to be quite enjoyable. Now, do not misconstrue what I am saying - this was nothing to write home about, nor would it be worth seeking out, but as a "find" and at its price point, it was fully worthwhile.

Smell is of grains, rice, and some grass notes. Taste is of sweet grains, minor rice flavors, and some herbal grassy flavors on the finish. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good rice lager coming straight from Japan. I was expecting something mediocre but I actually enjoy this one for what it is. Much better than Saporro for sure.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 19, 2011"
3.23,7.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Served really cold at sushi place in New York City this is a very clear yellow gold with a very healthy bubbly, white head and very little of any lacing. The aroma is simple clean cereal grain, sweet bread perhaps. Subtle. The taste brings sweet rice and light wheat, a crisp cereal beverage that refreshes and goes down mighty easily. The flavor is steady and compliments the Sushi nicely. It’s light-plus bodied with a thinish but lively feel. Still it has a little chewiness for the style. Not bad at all for what it is designed to be.","Durge","Jul 04, 2011"
3.13,4.3,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This beer is pale like a cheap apple juice. At least it has a nice white head. The aroma ever since I poured it is like some type of stanky lemon and wheat. It kinda yeasty. It's smells like a person who's not bathed in awhile and tried to cover it up with some lemons. I over-exaggerate of course, but the point remains the same. Smooth flavor light lemon mixed with some sort of light lager, because the only other flavors around are malt and mostly mineral water. Could be worse I suppose. The mouthfeel is okay, meaning it's as would be expected per the style. This beer has many faults, but as Kyle said "We have had SO much worse".","Vdubb86","May 18, 2011"
3.18,6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of slightly dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, grass, flowers, light cardamom (sorta), and a minor bit o' pepper. The taste holds notes of wheat, light greens, light lime zest, black pepper, flowers, and some very light caramel. The body is a hefty-ish (in the loosest sense) light, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that leans toward the crisper side of life. Overall, a decent brew, really not all that bad for a JPL. Normally these things hurt to drink: This one was just kinda bland and, you know, kinda there...","TMoney2591","May 15, 2011"

Its a sweet smell with only a touch of hops. The taste is also very generic. Its incredibly sweet all the way through with a slightly metallic aftertaste.

3.28,9.3,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Sweet 633 mL bottle with some code on the label; brewed with malt, cornstarch, corn grits, rice, water and hops. It's a crystal-clear, bright, light golden color, with light carbonation and three fingers of fluffy head that leaves a few patches of lacing. Very light aroma that is sweetish with a few notes of corn, and is almost pleasing really. Almost. Grassy and doughy malt flavors up front, backed by lemon, a hint of spicy hops, and a mild bitterness. The body is light and tingly, dry, and has a short finish. Not too bad of a beer really - it's nice and refreshing, and there are no real off-flavors. A decent, Japanese lawnmower beer.","mmmbeer","Feb 25, 2009"

Poured up a very light crystal clear straw colour with a one finger thick snow-white soapy head. Smell was a bit grainy like 100's of others in this style; honestly, there was little to it. Taste was extremely light with a small bit of perceivable rice and a slightly dry finish with a bit of a biscuity profile to it. Mouth feel was about as thin as it comes. Quite drinkable considering the style and when you'd be likely to have this. Would I go out of my way to purchase this for drinking at home? Certainly not. Would I order it at a Japanese place to wash down my sushi? Probably. Decent, considering the style and toward whom it is targeted.

The taste was not offensive, but was not anything to boast about. Basically a crisp, dry, grainy flavor with some malty sweetness thrown in. The hops were very light, but were not totally absent.
