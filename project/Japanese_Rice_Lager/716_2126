3.1,7.6,3,3,3,4,3,"The beer pours a dark yellow color with a nice even cap of foam floating above. The appearance is typical of an adjunct lager. The aroma is mainly bready. The flavor is light and clean save a few hints of husk. The adjunct emerges a little more as it warms. Nothing extraordinary here, but it would do well washing down Japanese fare.","BeardedBoffin","Jun 27, 2012"

2.9,0.7,2,2,3,3,4,"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Should go well with many kinds of food; no flavor to interfere with your appreciation of the food. On the other hand, there's not enough to entice me to drink more than this one. Ordinary, but not objectionable.","dbaker61","Feb 20, 2011"
3.24,12.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"You can use this to "clean your palate" in between sushi rolls and wasabi. Otherwise it is an unremarkable rice lager without any particularly prominent flavor.","BeerNemesis","Jul 15, 2010"
3.1,7.6,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Not to be tried again. Unless maybe it's the only beer at a restaurant in Japan.","TurdFurgison","Jul 27, 2009"
3.58,24.3,3,2.5,4,4,4,"D-Very drinkable, I think this is a type of beer to have a session with. I like it a lot better than say bud, even though it is a rice lager not an american","DT7","Jul 08, 2009"
3.73,29.5,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Definitely a nice one to try, especially if you have doubts about Asahi's brewing ability. I drank this beer exclusively for a couple months until it got old.","jpBeerGuy","Mar 30, 2009"
2.92,1.4,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer had a pale golden piss color with a very frothy head. Plenty of lace left behind on glass. Many Many bubbles. The smell was very faint with a bready yeasty smell. The taste is very light and smooth, mellow if you will. Some what watered down. The mouth feel is smooth and slick in the mouth. It goes down smooth and fast, defiantely a chuggable beer.","FrothyBeverage","Mar 18, 2009"
2.33,-19.1,2.5,2,2.5,2,2.5,"A so-so beer. I prefer a Sapporo over this for taste. Similar to a Kirin but a little drier.","Cylinsier","Mar 11, 2009"
3.13,8.7,3.5,3,3,4,3,"D: Pretty drinkable as it didn't have much flavor at all and was nice and light.","erosier","Dec 22, 2008"
2.95,2.4,3,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"The scent was not all that impressive. Aroma and flavour is simple malt and grains. Not much in the way of hops. Crisp but light on the tongue. Good enough to go with a meal, but nothing special in and of itself. It goes down very easily - so to sit with a meal it works very well.","Jayli","Nov 19, 2008"
3.31,14.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,2,3,"I imagine this going very well with a number of spicy dishes, but it's a tad too sweet on it's own for my taste.","bboven","Sep 30, 2008"
3.17,10.1,3,3.5,2.5,4.5,3.5,"This poured a pale clear yellow with moderate white head. It smelled of lemon and yeast with some hops. It tasted like a pale Belgian ale, slightly lemony and yeasty with no malt. It was smooth and nicely thick with almost no carbonation, and had a light bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall it was interesting, but nothing special.","Pencible","Mar 27, 2008"
2.33,-19.1,2.5,2,2,3,3,"D: Watery so you could put away a few but not all that pleasurable. Could be worse but definitely could be much better.","marcpal","Mar 20, 2008"
3.9,35.4,3,3,4.5,4,4,"Note: This well balance beer is far better if you drink on-tap and this draft thing is better Asahi than the super dry. You can enjoy this beer until you drunk.","Aquavit","Jan 14, 2008"
2.57,-10.8,2,2.5,2,3.5,3.5,"It is well drinkable, something that would go well on a hot summer day. There is an "umph" missing behind the taste as there is no real body to the beer. I would drink this again, but only if someone else was buying.","ekempey","Jul 12, 2007"
3.2,11.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"A nice refreshing crisp Rice Beer that goes nice with food as well.","HoustonTX","Aug 31, 2006"
2.53,-12.2,3.5,3,3,1,1.5,"This one actually produces a thin, spongy head with some lacing. It is light transparent urine in color and has the faintest aroma of peaches. Biting astringincy brings in soapy, yeasty, and slight apple suggestions. OK but funky and the mouthfeel really stings like a bitch. This is way over carbonated.","JudgeRoughneck","Apr 29, 2006"
2.73,-5.2,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"The taste and smell is that of a tried and true amber. Easy to drink and not too obtrusive. Only the hint of hops. But again it was easy to drink. Perhaps a good "session" beer for some.","stevecee2003","Dec 07, 2005"
2.68,-6.9,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Reviewed 04-02-04 and taken from notes. pours a bright yellow, with a full white head. Aroma of grass fill the nose. Very light flavor, slight sweetness, Good body for the style, finishes very dry for style, rice, acidic tinny notes overtake at the finish but leaves this an okay drinkable beer.","jimbotrost","Jun 01, 2005"
2.83,-1.7,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Smooth drinking, assertive carbonation pairs well with sushi or grilled dishes.","beersarang","Apr 19, 2005"
2.31,-19.8,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,3,"A friend brought a bomber over to go with a sushi dinner I did. While certainly not a remarkable beer, it did go well with the sushi. It is very clean smelling, showing slight cereal and bready malts. It has a crisp, ricey dry flavor that for all intents and purposes could be a Michelob or Rolling Rock. It is very thin and watery, especially if your normal choices for brews are barleys, Belgians, and assorted hop bombs. I only had a small glass out of respect, but quickly moved on to a Victory Golden Monkey for the rest of the meal.","AlexJ","Jan 09, 2005"
2.86,-0.7,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"This is a good beer if you are just looking for something light with dinner that you don't want to interfere with your food or to engage your tongue at all. If you're looking for a light palette cleanser other than water, this is not a bad choice.","GuinnessSmurf","Dec 23, 2004"
3.7,28.5,3,3,4,4,4,"I was in need of a mood adjustment and opted for this giant 33oz can over the line up of usual suspects. I did not have high expectations as my only other Japanese beer has been Sapporo, which I hated. Pleasantly, Asahi is a whole new ballgame. The taste is uncommonly smooth. The can describes this brew as "super dry", a claim that I found to be true. For the style, the taste was very enjoyable overall, very crisp and clean with a subtle husky-bitter aftertaste. Great mood adjuster.","thinkbreakfast","Jul 30, 2004"
3.65,26.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A decent moutfeel on this one too. There is a nice amount of carbonation for the style. I would have this again.","Ellbert","May 03, 2004"
1.29,-55.2,3,1.5,1,1.5,1,"This Japanese super dry draft beer has an average pale color to it hardly any aroma to it. Id like to say that there was a nice malt flavor to it but I couldnt find any and the same goes for the hops. It kind of reminds me of Budweiser with its lack of taste andwell everything. I will hand it to them on the carbonation; they did manage to get that right. Over all stick to water or ice tea on this one it taste better.","simmons","Feb 25, 2004"
2.18,-24.3,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Sinkability  I paid 3.99 for a bomber of this stuff. I think asahi is Japanese for gotcha.","RoyalT","Feb 18, 2004"
2.83,-1.7,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Simple and competent.","TerryW","Jan 20, 2004"
2.81,-2.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"The body is thin and bubblly. The taste is clean. No flaws other than a ginger-ale like taste that fades quickly. Sweet lager with no specific charecters and then its gone. Overall its a clean lager that went well with my sushi. Its very drinkable, but there are better versions of the style out there.","UncleFrank","Oct 16, 2003"
2.43,-15.6,2.5,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Poured a yellow reddish color, absolutely no head, There was a slight hop flavor, but otherwise thats it.Very dry aftertaste. Hop flavored seltzer water, nice for quenching your thirst, maybe cleasing your mouth during a hibatchi feast, but I like Sapporo better.","grynder33","Sep 30, 2003"
3.65,26.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The taste is quite crisp, and very clean, and quite full. Its a very pleasant working beer. I'll buy this again.","freed","Jul 21, 2003"
3,4.2,3,3,3,3,3,"The taste was very simple with flavors of malt and grain. There was nothing bad or good and definitely nothing surprising. Not a bad choice to have at a Japanese steak house if there are no micros available.","Loki","May 18, 2003"
3,4.2,3,3,3,3,3,"Color is a clear yellow with a medium foamy head with divets and leaves tiny patches of lace. Smells faintly of sweet malt grain and a hop, just barely. Taste is thinned out malt with a hint of sweetness and a super light hop. Mostly watered down and empty light to medium body with no hold or body. Not so good, not so bad either.","tavernjef","Apr 10, 2003"
2.61,-9.4,3.5,2.5,2,2,4,"Pours a clear bubbly pale yellow with a medium sized white head. A very faint aroma of a light earthy grain and very faint hops is barely evident in this brew. Again, the taste is very faint only revealing a carb bite, light hops, and faint earthy grain is all there is to this beer. It is labeled Super Dryby whose standards??? Not dry and in fact it finishes weak, thin, and watery. It would go good with a spiced food. Perhaps a food that needs cooling down a bit. It is extremely drinkable, but not so desirable if that makes sense. Kampai!","BeerAngel","Jan 27, 2003"
3.2,11.1,3,3,3,4,3.5,"I have this one on occasion, mostly when I am in NYC at a sushi eaterie. Not much to the flavour or aroma, thin and dry but there are virtually no off flavours. Does a good job washing down excess wasbi and cleaning the palate for the next roll.","Jason","May 26, 2002"
2.16,-25,3,2,2,3,2,"I thought this beer had a strange winey flavor and aroma. Not bad mind you, just a bit odd. Mouthfeel is prickly due to high carbonation. Very dry finish. Tastes sort of like mixing a dry white wine with beer.","John","Dec 06, 2001"
2.5,-13.2,2,2,2,3,4,"Lemon peel, grapefruit, rye and wheat.  Dry finish.  Came in a 34oz silver can.  "Japan's No. 1 Beer"  I poored some into a glass but made a mess.  Yellow tint, very carbonated head turned lumpy after a minute.  Very drinkable.","Jordan","Nov 20, 2001"
