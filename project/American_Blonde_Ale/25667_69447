Kind of like a cream ale with a bit more malt flavor and maybe more yeast character. I like this one, the earthiness from the malt and understated hop presence give this one a British feel to it. I still like the Pearl Snap Pils a little better than this as far as ABW offerings are concerned, but the Peacemaker ranks above the IPA for me.
