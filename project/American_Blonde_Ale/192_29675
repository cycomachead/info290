3.68,8.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 11/30/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, lime, orange peel, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops, spice, and bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, lime, orange peel, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, lime, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, and light pepper on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of citrus hops, spice, and bready malt flavors; with a nice crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Flavors are definitely on the light side, but it does not feel watery. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly dry mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice and pleasant blonde ale. Well balanced citrus hop, spice, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 11, 2014"

Smelled of apple, pear, slight menthol, and earthiness. The taste was a little more pronounced; apple/pear dissolving to some woody leaves, and then finishing on a grassy/minty note. A rather odd flavor mix, and rather thin too. Easy texture to drink, but not an easy flavor to appeciate.","donniecuffs","Jul 16, 2010"

Head retention is average with a good amount of lacing. There's a nice unique citrusy aroma in this brew, I guess it's the kaffir lime leaf (as stated on the label) that I smell. There's also some sweet malt and hops noticable, too. For the most part the taste is the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some bready malt flavor in this beer. There's also a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's nice and enjoyable. I liked this brew, it was a pleasant surprise.

Taste is a little watered down...tastes more watery than Fat Tire, but at the same time it is a bit better tasting to me.

It was slightly thick with a fair amount of carbonation, and a mild aftertaste. Overall this was more of a summer amber ale than a blonde ale, with too much in common with Fat Tire.

The pour was great, a bright reddish gold with a fluffy white head that stuck around til the end. There wasn't much aroma from the beer, just a generally malty beeriness, but the kaffir lime made its presence known when I picked up the glass up to my mouth. I couldn't really identify any single element that made me like this beer so much, but I like the balance of the malt, hops, citrus, and the carbonation. The beer had good complexity, with the hop bitterness first, then the fullness of the malt, and finishing with the fruit. I liked it all, in my opinion much better than the rest of the brewer's offerings (i.e. Fat Tire). The beer was smooth and light but also very satisfying.

The beer is very smooth and carbonation goes unnoticed while drinking, unlike lite incarnations of many beers. this is a very drinkable beer, not one that makes you not want to stop, but it is very good and pleasant nonetheless.

This has a very aggressive edge from the malt component that I just don't find appealing; this is an edge I associate with biscuit malt. The flavor starts with an aggressive husky grain and biscuity character with a zesty lime citrus character. I find the flavor to be a bit watered down after the initial kick.

This beer has a slight tartness and a definate spicyness to it, though that could just be the nearly excessive carbonation, and its rounded out with a slight citrusy flavor. It has a bit of a watery mouthfeel, but that seems to add to the character of the beer. This is definatly a refreshing beer, one that you would drink after a long and hot day.

Served over rice and spiced with garam marsala, garlic, red chili, and coriander, the dish packed a not-so-subtle punch. This beer went perfectly with dinner. Apparently, the juxtaposition of countries worked well with my Americanized Indian dish and Belgianized American Blonde ale. Unlike most sweet or spicy dishes that usually compete with beer, especially hoppy beers, the sweet-spicy tomato sauce was brought to life by the juicy orange Skinny Dip which contributed its own aromatic spices. The hops in the beer were low enough profile-wise to allow the taffy malts to emerge without being too sweet. I'd definitely drink this again.","dnrobert24","Aug 07, 2006"

They really used hops well in this too, fresh and a bit floral, but a bit musty and resinous. Nice crisp mouthfeel. Far from the dankest beer, but I feel like this one is put together very well.

The malts are a little crisp and bready, much more of a nut overtone than I would expect from a blonde ale (but entirely to be expected from a New Belgium beer).

The taste is pretty good. Good citrus/malt balance which was expected from this brewer. I think it would be better with a little more carbonation.

The aroma is hoppy and citric, and while the flavor doesn't grab, the finish is admirable. There's some puffy, cratered lace after the pour, and the hops and lime flavors recede after a few sips. But the nose makes the beer. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, doesn't give the tongue much to hang on to, but drinkability is quite high.

3.65,7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this one served to me on tap at Old Chicago in Omaha. Not the best place for reviewing beer but I was bored. It poured with a large billowing head even from the bartender who always seems to pour a flat beer. The smell is light, some easy breathing grains mixed with lemon zest and some other citrus notes. The taste is off of what I had expected for a belgian pale. Very grainy, very smooth. A nice flavor but not what I expected at all. The mouthfeel is a bit watery with adequate carbonation but not matching the ginormous head. Overall a nice offering. Try it if you can.","hoffman","Apr 25, 2006"

2.39,-29.7,4,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"The flavor does not improve as the beers warms. It's probably best consumed at the usual frigid lager temperature. I don't believe this one lives up to NB's standards set with Blue Paddle, Fat Tire, 1554, and their Belgians.","etenbus","Apr 19, 2006"
3.16,-7.1,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,4,"This is an extremely drinkable beer, but mostly because it's so unoffensive. Would be a decent "summer beer after hard labor", but not something I'd drink on a regular basis.","waldowin","Apr 19, 2006"
3.03,-10.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"I think that overall, I was a little disappointed with this beer. But having that said, I think that it is exactly what they were probably shooting for: a light, mildly spicy, summer beer. Good for a change, but I wont come knocking very often.","Mitchel","Apr 19, 2006"
2.42,-28.8,4.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability- Tastes like any other macro. Passing up this if I ever see it again. Damn close to a drain pour.","GClarkage","Apr 18, 2006"
3.62,6.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Golden amber in color with a slight white head. Flowery in smell with a slight peach scent. A hint of hops. Cool and crisp in taste. Very smooth seems to be the summary of taste. Not my favorite style but tastes good for a lighter beer and very drinkable. My wife simply loves this beer. She says she could drink way too many on a nice summer day outside. I much prefer Sunshine Wheat.","johnyeast","Apr 16, 2006"
3.03,-10.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability  Its a tough style to do right and isnt any better than that boring Porch Swing beer that they put out.","RoyalT","Apr 16, 2006"
4.45,30.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Apparently the replacement for Loft, with some slight reworkings of the recipe; this beer has a little nuttier malt character than the Loft, along with a woody, resinous hoppy aroma that I don't recall in Loft, and perhaps slightly different hop flavor. Otherwise, the delightful kaffir character (citrusy yet exotic) is still present. Wheat flavor seems reduced. Very good and refreshing beer. I never get tired of it.","allengarvin","Apr 16, 2006"
3.85,13.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It is very smooth and drinkable with only a 4.2% ABV. I think it is a great summer brew.","zeff80","Apr 15, 2006"

3.87,13.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Color is a pale amber with a moderate level of carbonation. Head is small and off-white. The aroma has a strong citris smell, a combo of hops and the kaffir lime. The initial taste is a combo of floral and citrissy hop flavors. A bready, slightly grainy body has a flavor similar to a lighter version of Fat Tire. A touch of lime is noted towards the finish. Skinny Dip is thrist-quinching and has a nice ease of drinkability. Pretty good entry for the summer craft beer market.","Gagnonsux","Beers"
3.86,13.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Quite drinkable for a New Belgium beer. Dry tasting and not overly malty as most beers they make are. I could see buying this again or ordering while traveling.","Zorro","0"
3.76,10.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Had the first three beers from the tap. It took about 5 minutes for each glass I ordered due to excessive foam which lingered quite a while after the pour. Since the tap was just hooked up, the beer was room temp, which didn't hurt anything; almost seemed like I was drinking a cask ale. Overall a very good and refreshing summer brew, although I don't understand the comparisons to Loft. Loft had a hoppier bite whereas this more subdued and malt-accentuated. Finishes dry and thinner than the initial heavy head would have implied. Very enjoyable; easy to drink and nothing short on flavor.","Gruntlumber","Apr 11, 2006"

3.38,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a new offering from New Belgium replacing Loft Beer, although it is quite similar. Decent head of white foam, fair retention. The color is ultimately clear and a medium gold. Smell is light, with an aroma of piney hops. The taste is very clean, with more hop flavor and a bit of tangy spice in the finish. The bready malt flavor is fairly weak. Hop bitterness is moderate. Fairly light in body, it has a strong zesty carbonation that pierces the front of the tongue. Very crisp and clean overall, unfortunately reminding me more of light macros than any Belgian Pale Ale I've tried. It's drinkable, but nothing too exciting...","bennetj17","Apr 06, 2006"
3.92,15.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Clear amber colored brew with a moderate white head that disipates rather quicklybut still leaves some traces of lace. The aroma is bready with just a suggestion of citrus. The taste is light bready malt with a trace of caramel and citrus. Slightly dry from the start, with a nicely dry citrus finish. Smooth and easy to take in quantity. Should be a good hot weather option.","whynot44","Apr 06, 2006"
4.07,19.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall impression: First of all, I'm not huge on the marketing behind this, but I suppose New Belgium wants a piece of the light beer market. This definitely seems a bit different than I remember Loft, but it has been at least a year since I've tried that one. All in all this is a very drinkable summer session beer, and I'm sure I will enjoy more than my fair share over the coming months.","rowew","Beers"
4.13,21.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Edit: After following up with the folks at New Belgium, they claim it's a totally different beer than FT (different malts, hops, adjuncts). But perhaps it's their yeast that gives it the trademark flavor. I still stand by the FT lite beer.","dreadnatty08","0"
