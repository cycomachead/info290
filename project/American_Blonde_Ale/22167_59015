Nothing really shines. Not a poorly brewed beer, no off-flavors. I just have had much more interesting blondes where you really get a sense of a nice base malt with complimentary hops.","sjccmd","Jan 22, 2015"

4,19,,,,,,"Overall: A good example of the blonde ale style. The flavor is pleasant and interesting, but stays out of the way and doesn't try to make a bold statement. I would have preferred the malts to be a little more toasty or maybe biscuity rather than grainy, but I could be misperceiving that. A solid member of the Fulton lineup, that should not be overlooked just because it doesn't have an overpowering amount of hops or malt.","enjambed","Nov 01, 2014"
