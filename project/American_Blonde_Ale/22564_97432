This ale pours a golden hue with little white head and virtually no lacing. The nose reminds me of hot chocolate. Not a lot of coffee notes just a subtle sweet chocolaty smell. There's a lot of malt here as well and a bit of hops to round it out. This offering sips very light and smooth. The flavor is much more complex than I had ever expected. It is sweet and reminiscent of iced mocha at first but followed by a nice hoppy bitterness all to resolve with a sweet malty chocolate finish. This is a delicious and surprisingly complex beer. Nothing like what I expected but very refreshing and enjoyable. Would gladly buy this one again.","lochef81","Feb 22, 2014"

Taste is much the same with vanilla and coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the coffee aspect doesn't really work all that well with the base beer in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 17, 2014"

It smells and tastes as it's labeled, but it looks completely mismatched and causes a mild mind bending when you make the transfer from sight to smell to taste. I actually enjoyed Bean Flicker more than I had anticipated... It was quite tasty, really, though the optical illusion aspect is something my tickled brain couldn't overcome completely.","tectactoe","Sep 10, 2013"

4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours lightly hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big nutty coffee, vanilla, cream, light bread, floral, and light grass. Awesome aromas with big presence of coffee and malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big nutty coffee, cream, vanilla, bread, floral, and light grass. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of nutty coffee, vanilla, cream, light bread, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Awesome robustness of coffee/cream flavor with a fair amount of malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Hardly any alcohol presence after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is an outstanding coffee blonde ale. Great robustness of authentic coffee/cream flavor; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 04, 2013"

This is my favorite sessionable beer at only 4.5% ABV I could drink this beer all day. If it proves to be available year round I have a new go to beer. I hate blonde ales because they usually lack flavor and complexity but this one has me wanting to revisit the style. Love Odd Side's brews highly recommend this beer!","king75","Aug 17, 2013"

What do you want me to say? The flavor of this is actually a bit more than I thought to expect, but that's fine by me. If that's not enough, there's a solid feel to this as well. The coffee flavor manages to stick to your tongue for awhile after you sip, which I enjoy a lot -- ya don't need a dark beer to get a coffee fix in your beer, and this blonde ale proves that. A 4.5% beer with a nice body? Surprisingly bold flavor? Count me in. Odd Side just doesn't disappoint... worth the slight up-charge.","Alextricity","Aug 11, 2013"

It is an interesting take on a blonde ale, different from anything I have had. I love coffee stouts, but this is the first light style I have had. I recommend this for every one looking for something session able, flavorful and different!","jbck109","Aug 09, 2013"
4.24,10.4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a great example of a coffee infused beer that didn't have a dark beer base, it showed me that while the dark beer base can meld well with the coffee flavors it isn't always a necessary and that coffee has the potential to work with the other styles that I never would have thought would have turned out to be good. This beer has very good drinkability, it's smooth, crisp, not filling, and the flavors did a good job of holding my attention and keeping me coming back for more, it wouldn't be a stretch from me to drink more than a few bottles of this since that taste really doesn't wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was just about everything, all aspects of this beer were right where they needed to be to live up to it's name. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I already went back and got a six pack and I see a few more in my future and it just my be a new regular in my beer fridge, I would recommend this to anyone who likes coffee infused beer. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I have been pretty impressed with Oddsides but I wasn't sure that they could pull of a Coffee Blonde Ale, but they did it in a way that truly impressed me. It really messed with my head at first because it looks exactly like a normal Blonde Ale, but the taste is anything but normal. Great job Oddsides, you guys are making some great beer and I have no problem claiming that their one of my favorite up in coming brewery's. keep up the great work guys.","StoutHunter","Aug 09, 2013"

3.54,-7.8,4,3.75,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. Here we get an instantly curious juxtaposition of a clean blonde ale base, with nicely bittered grain, while atop it we ride alongside stronger coffee flavoring than we’ve experienced in some straight coffee stouts. The case is very much the same through the flavoring, with the first and last thing you’re left thinking about is this bright hazelnut coffee roastiness. It’s quite the odd pair, no pun intended. That said, it seems as if they’ve accomplished what they set out to do with this one, and we are happy to have been a part of the experiment. One downside was the carbonation, which approached the level of champagne, slowing drinkability a bit. This beer will certainly not appeal to everyone, but if you’ve got the interest it is certainly worth your time.","TheBrewo","0"
