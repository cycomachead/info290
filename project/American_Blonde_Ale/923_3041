I don;t know because the beer practically has no aroma other than a beery smell. The taste is an average blonde ale, nothing hoppy about it, the malts are unremarkable, boring.

3.06,-8.4,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a bright yellow with a fluffy white head. The bottles artwork is pretty neat as well. Says it's brewed with honey but I can't really smell or taste anything to indicate that. Not surprising seeing as how you have to really dump in honey to change the final beer. Tastes light and clean. Mainly of pale malt. Slight hop bittering and some noble hop-like flavors. Not bad but not really exciting. There are tastier (and cheaper) blonde ales out there.","drunkboxer1","Jun 22, 2009"

Great clarity though. The aroma was light, slightly sweet and grainy. The flavors were at first a bit of honey sweetness with some grassy undertones and floral hops. As it finished biscuity malts appeared. Good mouthfeel and light to medium bodied. Not much to think about but a good session beer and easy drinking.","thekevlarkid","Sep 16, 2008"

What I didn't get was a lot of cereal-ness, which I usually associate with beers of this style (that's a bad thing). Flavor was extremely light and pleasant.

Only a subtle wiff of honey, and that seemed more sour, than sweet. Old beer taste, like stale beer from your dad's stash in 10th grade taste. Still tastes like beer though, and that's good. Honey taste is nearly lost on me. Comes and goes. Light bodied, highly charged. Easy enough going down, not much lingers. A decent beer, nowhere near the level of their ten pin porter.
