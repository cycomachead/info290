It has a citrusy finish, similar to a pale ale. I give it points for being organic and it seems relatively complex for a lighter beer.","boothw","Mar 13, 2014"

The body is pretty light, with a light carbonation and a nearly crisp finish. Overall, a very ordinary brew, nothing much going on, but very drinkable nonetheless.

The head is not persistent. The beer is uninteresting and boring. I didn't think that beer can live up to its name on the label. The hops are dull in the beer and adds no character.

Either way, this beer tastes good. I'd even like the hoppiness if it were a Golden Ale, so no marks against it. The mouthfeel is juicy and clean, with a crisp & bubbly finish that picks up a touch of bitterness from the hops.

3.82,7.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This bottle foamed over after I popped the cap, not due to anything I could control--it has been sitting upright, unagitated for a week. Styrofoam white head, chunky but not overly consistent. The beer is a fuzzy nectarine colour, and the head leaves rings of thick lacing. The aroma is unexpected, but delightful: citrusy Belgian pale ale aroma here, almost like the metallic tang of Orval. The yeast definitely plays a role in the smell, giving a soapiness and sourish fruitiness. A strange combination of malt, and little to suggest hops at all. The metallic and tart fruitiness really dominates. This is not complex, but I enjoy it quite a bit. Pineapple citrus and grapefruit on the mouth, leaving a bitterness like pomegranate seeds. Light malts mingle with the strong lemon citrus, and again hops are not easy to find in the taste, whilst they do leave the dryness. The taste definitely has some Belgian characteristics. I would say grapefruit and lemon are the two most detectable flavours here, with the light malt in the background. This possesses some similarities to hefeweizens as well, not only in the unfiltered look, but the sour but revitalising wheat-like tastes(and judging by the bottom of the bottle this beer is unfiltered.) The body is medium and refreshing, and the carbonation is average. The strange aftertaste is unique for this style, and actually quite quaffable. This is bit of hybrid in my opinion--pale ale does not quite describe it.","Cwrw","May 17, 2005"
3.63,2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The Naughty Nellie that Naughty Nellie's Ale was named after was a lady of the evening, harlot, tart... take your pick.

Malts are complex, with some nuts, butter and caramel. Hops are noticeable but not at all bitter, just appealing and moreish. Incredibly soft finish. Would probably be awesome on a not-too-hot summer day. Your girlfriend may love it. A very good, and unique beer.
