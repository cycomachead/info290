3.5,1.7,,,,,,"The beer pours a white bubbly head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear pale gold. the beer has a very sweet malt smell The smell also has some light bready yeast notes and a light hop profile. There also appears to be toasty notes as well. The taste is similar to the smell but that the hop profile is mulch stronger and more bitter with a lemony hop flavor, light banana yeast notes, Belgian spices and hints of the rye mash. The beer's mouthfeel is light bodied and very little carbonation but smooth and a bit creamy. Leaves refreshing aftertaste. The beer is a decent blond ale.","HattedClassic","Aug 26, 2014"

3.88,12.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 4/11/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a very nice blonde ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 28, 2014"

Honestly, it is not immensely different from lighter colored lagers (though this is an ale), but does include a good depth of flavor for being 'restricted', in a sense, to the guidelines of a simple style. If this came in cans, it'd be a great, easily drinkable tailgate beer come football season.","Beric","Jul 04, 2013"

Poured a clear yellow color - produced a small white head, average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted wheat, sweet grain- Light in body, there was a base of cereal grain, some hop bitterness. Easy to drink - good summer beer.","GossageBrewery","Jun 11, 2013"

Easy drinking as it should be. Big bitter smack at each sip. I was not expecting that. Bitter, peppery, sweetness is short and fleeting. This was not the refreshing drink I was expecting it to be. This had some harshness to it, that I don't think belongs in this light simple style. When I want some bitterness, I'll reach for a IPA or hoppy PA. With a Blonde, I expect sweet flavors, light crisp feel, and an ease of drinkability. This was not that. Not my cup of tea. Pass.","Onenote81","Aug 21, 2012"

The nose comprises lemon zest, mandarin orange flesh, flowers, and a tiny hint o' funky sour. The taste is similar, though the lemon brings some of its rind along for the ride, creating some extra bitterness toward the end. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a rather smooth feel.

Similar as the far as the taste goes, a quick hit of bitter hops, refreshing, then a slightly stale taste of lager yeast takes over.

3.13,-9,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Thin pure white head, barely lasts a few seconds before dissolving into islands across the surface, no lacing at all. Hazy enough to induce a decent translucency to the orange-yellow color, this haze prevents much hue loss at the rims. Orange and lemon citrus break into your nostrils first, bready in a semi-uncooked manner, somewhat earthy more so than floral, not many fruit scents nor malt sweetness, overall just trails off on you as if in mid-sentence. Medium-bodied, holds its weight consistently throughout and the carbonation plays an able supporting role. There's some sort of pickled or saline bitterness to it, doesn't seem directly attributable to the grass, straw, sourdough bread flavors. No malt rescue unit on the scene. The citrus element is mixed and without a clear character. Comes across as "beer" albeit crafted beer, wish the whole was more than the sum of the parts.","farrago","May 28, 2009"

(Quick edit: the beer is apparently bottle-conditioned and once the yeast settles out, it seems to clear up some, unsurprisingly) The nose doesn't exactly blow me away, but there's nothing offensive about it and I can imagine a bit more hop aroma from a very fresh bottle, not that this one is old. The nose has a bit of spicy, earthy, mineral hops against a backdrop of pale malt. The flavor is similar with a bit of grassiness coming in and touches of lemon and corn. The whole thing seems like a European lager. I recently had a nice German Pilsener, and Third Coast Beer is bringing that back to mind readily. I would love to try this beer on tap at the brewery or within a few weeks of bottling because the flavors on these light, fresh beers can be fickle.

The nose smells of malt, but you really have to strain to smell them. The flavour is mostly maltiness but really smooth. There is a bitterness to the beer, but it's quite subdued. The hops come through at the end, and they are slightly grassy. There is a sweetness in the beer that comes through after the beer warms up, which gives it a pleasant aftertaste.

The first sip is cracking crisp and very dry, with a stiff bitterness. Definitely a hop-oriented taste, but not one you'd expect from a pale ale... an intriguing blend of floral and citrusy. The clean bitterness extends well into the aftertaste, washing each sip away nicely.

The malt and hop flavors work well together with one supporting the other, and it's nicely balanced by a bold bitterness that leaves it refreshingly raspy-dry in the finish. It lingers... spicy, grassy, bitter... similar to a fresh German lager. It's basic, fresh, hoppy beer as I'd imagine beer was prior to the Volstead act of 1919.","NeroFiddled","Feb 18, 2007"

Flavors are initially malty with bread and nutty flavors kicking in. This flavors are quickly overwhelmed by a zesty citrus hop that dominates the finish of this beer. There's also a bit of spice to this beer along with a refreshing carbonation that leaves the mouth tinglin a bit. Overall this beer is fairly light bodied, has some interesting flavors to it, but it just doesn't all come together.","bigbeerdrinka","Jun 09, 2004"
2.82,-18,2,2.5,3,3,3,"I was not very impressed with this particular selection. Although supposedly a pale ale, it did not really look or taste like one to me. First, I was a little frightened by the appearance - a myriad flecks of yeast (I suppose) were floating about in my glass. It pours a pale yellow color, several shades paler than what I am used to seeing from pale ales. The smell was almost acidic and chemical-like. The taste was only slightly better. I hope that perhaps I just got a bad bottle - I was not expecting something of this quality coming from the same brewers that bring us the divine Two-Hearted Ale.","profzoom","May 29, 2004"

Anyway I think that's a Pittsburgh thing that they package especially for Tony Knipling of Vecenie's. Appearance: Cloudy, white cranberry with an orangish yellow haze over it. Forms a nice white fluffy head with the yeast visible in the final pour leaves some evenly strung lacing. Aroma: Candi sweetness sugar tone wrapped in hop bitterness yeast character gives this brew the characteristic ringwood spiced breadiness, yum. Taste: Upfront bitterness not much balance touch of sweetness is there but mainly a dry mix of biscuit malts and spicy hops. Mouthfeel: Medium body loads of yeast suspension easy carbonation.

Maltiness is crisp, body is light, the finish is dry with a big smack of bitterness. A bit of spicy hops in the middle but the very light malty start and bitter finish pretty defines this beer. An excellent light ale for hopheads. This is a simple beer. I wouldn't be shocked if only one malt was used in making this brew. The very dry, bitter finish makes me want more of this stuff.","marcobrau","Mar 16, 2004"

Flavor begins slightly malty, some toasted cracker and yeast, with a large hop presence... earthy and citric hops add a lingering bitterness that is quite nice.

The smell was somewhat citrusy and malty with notes of grain and bread and a faint whiff of sulfur. The taste was dominated by the bitter and somewhat soapy hops, almost lager-like. The malt was there but not enough to balance the hops. The mouthfeel was smooth but hoppy and a bit tangy. The body was medium and the carbonation good. The hoppy taste lingered. This was a decent beer, but a little thin on flavor and low on malt balance.","UncleJimbo","Feb 11, 2004"

There was a wonderful hoppy explosion that got sweeter as it warmed up in my mouth. This beer reminds me so much of SN Pale, but with a huge upgrade.

Aroma is all malts, very biscuity, and bread doughish, with a slight soft touch of apple and citrus. Taste is darn nice, layered and fairly complex malts, soft and appealing, slight breadish quality with subdued yeast and hops that lend a bit earthy, nice mellowing bitterness and dryness follows through and lingers longly into the back of the throat and tongue. Very well balanced. Feel is a lighter medium body, pretty full too, with a bizaar light creamyness in the middle and giving way to a slight tingly dryness into the finish. This was a surprise to say the least, wasn't expecting it to be this good after reading so many mixed reviews. I figured its a Bell's it can't be all bad. And its not. One heck of a easy, well balanced little brew.","tavernjef","May 27, 2003"

Interestingly, the place I had it today called it a summer seasonal. This was a typical cask beer, fairly bright yellow, with not much head, although no less than one should expect. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Actually a wonderful taste, nicely balanced malts and hops, with several layers of complexity. This beer is a great example of the miracles of real cask ale, as it lets the characteristics of the beer really stand out. Buy it, if you can find it on cask.","jackndan","Apr 02, 2003"
3.95,14.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Brilliant clear golden hue until the poured yeast sediment provides a uniform turbidity. Fluffy, well retained pure white head leaves coarse lace. Floral hop nose, with soft doughy malt and hints of butterscotch. Subdued, pleasant green apple. Enticing aroma. Quick snap of bready sweetness on the palate is washed by a surge of sharp hop bitterness that's initially non descript. Hop character becomes herbal mid palate, surfacing along with a grainy dextrin malt pseudosweetness and mellow diacetyl. Moderate in body, and both proteinaceous and amply dextrinous in mouthfeel. Creamy. Finishes with a brief resurgence of maltose, but otherwise dry and pleasantly bitter. Certainly a quirky brew and quite flavorful at that. Not overly lager like. Remincescent of a Paulaner Munich Lager / Anchor Liberty ale hybrid with a drop of diacetyl. Uniquely tasty. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for sending this bottle!","marc77","Mar 26, 2003"

Pale gold mildly cloudy from setiment in the bottom of the bottle. Some lacing. Mix of mild malt with a sour flavor that moves to drynesss that leaves a long after taste (that is sometimes too bitter). Appropriately medium to thin, with just a little too little of body.

Hoppiness dominates the flavor profile and the overall impression -- while there is enough of a brown sugar and cardamon sense to the malt to lend a creamy and balanced mouthfeel, the finish and memory is citrusy hoppy and bitter oily, overall.

Gradually subsided and left a small amount of lacing. Rich malty aroma with caramel, alcohol, and a light floral hoppiness. Flavor dominated at first by a rich, malty sweetness that was balanced by a hop bitterness. Aftertaste dominated by hops but had some caramel flavors. Slightly acidic and astringent. Full mouthfeel and a dry finish. Moderate carbonation. Not bad.","stoutman","Aug 08, 2002"

A couple fingers worth of foamy, cream-colored head that reduces to a nice cake with minimal lacing. Sweet, floral smell complemented by light bready notes. Given the wonderful look and nose of this beer as well as the general strength of Kzoo brews, the taste is something of a downer. Bitterness rules the day from the start to the afternotes. Other flavors (sweetness, citrus, and yeast, most notably) are overtaken but are nonetheless detectable. This beer seems to cling quite a bit, which is probably more noticeable because of the persistent bitterness. It is more than adequately drinkable, but there are better choices both in this style and from Kzoo Brewing.","BitteBier","Beers"
