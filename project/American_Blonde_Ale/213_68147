3.78,3.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a nonic: Gansett Summer presents itself beautifully with a clear, straw gold body and a thick, fluffy white head that hangs out for a while. Aroma is modest, but good, with a distinct citrus component mingling with sweet and grainy notes. Its flavor is modest as well, but well done. It is a 4.2% summer beer after all. There is just a faint hint of the citrus coming thru, but is second to a very crisp, clean, refreshing malt profile, which seems as though there is some wheat in there too, which lightens the whole affair. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy however. I gotta say the lacing on this one is impressive. Overall, a very well done summer blonde: crisp, clean and to the point, although those looking for a more "robust" flavored summer beer (oberon, hop sun) may be dissapointed. But for what it is, a clean, lower alcohol summer ale, I enjoyed it, and would probably get it again.","Finn","Apr 24, 2012"

3.83,4.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to Rubby for passing this on for a try. This summer treat is an anemic gold color with few signs of life but it does produce a voluptuous white crown of foam and gobs of lacing in retreat. The nose picks up a pretty pungent skunky wheat bread with a hint of cider. Hard to say whether this is good or not so good, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt...I'm thirsty. The flavor is light but not at all complacent as I get more skunky bread, wheat and sunny citrus hop. Very crisp with a delicate but deliberate carbonation that peppers the palate pretty aggressively. This is clearly a nice choice for sessioning/partying. Light bodied, near watery but held together by the lively feel. Lots of bread and a tasteful hint of bright hops to make this a very serviceable thirst quencher. Take it out on Narragansett Bay the next time you push off from the docks at the East Greenwich Yacht Club, bring some chips and salsa and a few Ghandi Bots for dessert, and all you need is a good friend or two to make it a great evening.","Durge","Sep 23, 2011"

Well, it is way better than I expected it to be when I first saw this on the shelves earlier this summer, but I had heard what a nice hop profile this has...and I just don't get it. Maybe this has been on the shelves (or actually fridge) of the beer store for a while and the hops have faded some, but it just wasn't as expected. However, this is definitely a better than passable summer thirst quencher. A day of working in the yard, a round of golf, a day on the deck or at the pool - this will work fine.

3.8,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A big shout out to woodychandler for the hook up. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, some grains. Taste is a good hop/malt balance, some citrus flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and enjoyable beer.","tone77","Jun 23, 2011"
3.73,1.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and at only 4.2%, this is pretty light. Overall, I'm really enjoying this and I think the brewers hit the nail on the head with a light refreshing summer beer that has more flavor than your typical summer beer.","Kinsman","Jun 22, 2011"
3.66,0,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A little bit heavier than I would preffer for the style and the carbonation is very soft. Not a bad light summer beer here. Narragansett again makes a pretty kickin' seasonal.","Bendurgin","Jun 22, 2011"
4.09,11.7,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"O- If this was available in my area, it would be my go-to beer throughout the hot weather season. What an impressive beer that absolutely nails what it set out to do!","turfy","Jun 17, 2011"
3.53,-3.6,4.5,4,3,4,3.5,"O: Surprisingly not bad. Old school fifties aura meets modern attempt to appeal to broader, more discerning audiences with mixed results. This is a good beer to get thoughtless with, grab a few, hit the roof deck with friends and just chill with some music. It tries to work in some more complexity than its flagship predecessor, but stumbles as much as it strides, as the light fruitiness and the hops progress, but the discrepancy between that and the sour middle, mediocre aftertaste weigh this beer down.","phantomwyse","Jun 17, 2011"
3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: Best thing I have had from 'Gansett and what I would describe as a perfect lawnmower beer. Enough strength and beer taste to quench the thrist and keep on going. Complex enough to make me want the full six.","tigg924","Jun 15, 2011"
4.1,12,4,4,4,5,4,"Side Note - along with my inexpensive 6-pack of tall-boy cans, I got a free neck tie. It is polyester blue with anchors and the traditional Naragansett "Hi Neighbor" Can't imagine actually wearing it, but found it quite amusing","BigH75","Jun 15, 2011"
4.05,10.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The Crack & Glug produced two dense fingers of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and an abundance of visible CO2 bubbles. Nose had an interesting lemony citrus scent. Mouthfeel was very full thanks to all of the carbonation. There was a light pine hoppiness along with the lemon citrusiness noted on the nose. Finish was quite dry and refreshing and I realized that I should have been outside on this warm afternoon to drink it, rather than inside at the keyboard. This definitely rates a place in the cooler.","woodychandler","Jun 14, 2011"
4.07,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Flavors of cereal grains, caramel malts with a mini hop snap on the finish. Some light fruit flavors like apple or pear too with a hint of lemon zest. I really like the soft mouthfeel of this beer and high drinkability level.","Hibernator","Jun 10, 2011"
4.15,13.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Why couldn't they market this as their "light" beer? Regardless, a decent example!","Brad007","Jun 09, 2011"
4.05,10.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O - a good summer beer that I'll be drinking a lot of this summer.","JoeyBeerBelly","Jun 05, 2011"
3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer reminded me of craft brewery takes on the cream ale. It started off with a light, somewhat cream bread taste and then a spicy citrus hop finish. It's simple, but a tasty session option.","tempest","Jun 05, 2011"
3.97,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Sampled at the B/A Craft Brew Fest on June 3, 2011. The pour is a hazy golden-yellow with a bit of a fizzy white head. Up front on the nose there seems to be a sweetish malt character above anything else with a little hint of citrus zing. The body was a bit better than average in the medium range. The taste was quite sweet at the start but then evolved into a butternut, citrus circus and a slightly dryer finish. Pretty good summer.","puboflyons","Jun 04, 2011"
4.5,23,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is the best new beer I've had in a long time and solid proof that Narragansett's rebirth is on solid footing -- it's a hell of a lot more than "Hi neighbor!" nostalgia. Proof that you can make a refreshing "lawnmower" beer with plenty of character that brings the flavor but, at 4.2 ABV, doesn't knock you on your ass. I'lll be drinking a LOT of this...","SeussMD","Jun 02, 2011"
3.98,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a very easy drinking beer that has a well balanced flavor. Very refreshing and with 4.2% abv you can enjoy a few while camping or at a BBQ.","WanderingFool","May 30, 2011"
3.53,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall one that I am glad to have tried, but don't need to have again. Of 'Gansett's four seasonals this one was my least favorite.","Another6Pack","May 29, 2011"
3.9,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Wow, it seems like every summer ale is lemon this or wheat that, Narraganset does an English mild/IPA with a perfect balance of macro beer and session ale. This beer would be amazing on cask. Such a unique style, this might actually give the Gansett Bock a run for the money.","taez555","May 27, 2011"
4.01,9.6,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This is much better than most summer ales I've had. 'Gansett summer, for example, makes an embarrassment out of Sam Adams's summer offering. I'm so glad this brewery came back from the dead. They should brew a beer called "zombie Gansett."","abriggs1","May 25, 2011"
4.05,10.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The feel of this beer is pretty light. There is a slight push of bitterness but this beer just stays smooth and then is gone down before any real notice.","Duhast500","May 22, 2011"
3.95,7.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Drinkability is high and this is a great beer for just sitting on the beach. i found it to be more enjoyable straight from the can then when poured and I am glad that i have a case to tide me over for memorial day weekend","mikey711","May 22, 2011"
4.35,18.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is an excellent BBQ beer to pound down for a very long time.","TheManiacalOne","May 18, 2011"
4.15,13.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I bought a six pack this year as soon as it appeared on the shelves. In the past year, I have had some remarkably mediocre summer beers and American Blonde Ales. As a result, I am bumping this to a 4.5 overall. It's not a mind-blowing beer, but it is one of the best of this style.","angrybabboon","May 18, 2011"
3.79,3.6,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"O - this is quite a nice summer brew and definitely worth picking up for the price. i thought it was going to be a bit better than it was but again not at all disappointed. it must be noted that its an extremely drinkable brew.","celticfutblclub","May 17, 2011"
3.51,-4.1,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Quaffable summer ale, a solid brew all around.","Jason","May 16, 2011"
4.35,18.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Medium bodied with the carbonation on the light side of medium, I'm digging the mouth feel and if I had this around my neck of the woods regularly, I'd drink a heck of a lot of it. Wonderful brew!!","Bitterbill","May 16, 2011"
4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"16oz. can served in my Sam Smith tulip nonic. Pours a translucent straw gold with a pillowy, 1.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a 1/8th inch cap with delicate strands of lacing encircling the shoulders. Nose is light and pleasant - wheat, citrus, apricot and a kiss of floral hops. Taste consistent with nose with the floral hops character present in the nose revealing itself at the finish. Really quite flavorful for such a low abv beer. Mouthfeel is light in body with a refreshing, palate cleansing carbonation and a semi-dry finish. This is a fantastic session beer and the 16oz. tallboys make it perfect for summer. I see this as becoming a staple in my fridge over the coming months.","Jwale73","May 15, 2011"
4.21,15,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O - Overall, this is a damn good beer from Narragansett and quite possibly my favorite seasonal of theirs. For the price ($7.99/5 tall boys) you cant even come close to value. Hands down my new summer session beer.","rudzud","May 14, 2011"
4.08,11.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass luckily as the three finger cream colored head was barely contained. The head falls slowly to a half inch blanket. Decent lacing. The brew is golden yellow in color. The nose is some hop tartness, fruit, citrus, a little grain and slight malt sweetness. The taste is very clean and crisp. A nice blend of mild hops and light sweetness. Finishes quite dry with a slight bitterness. The body is light with active carbonation..a touch course. Overall a good summer drinker and a great value to boot!","ThirstyBird","May 13, 2011"
3.45,-5.7,4,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Question: Why is this classified as a Blonde ale on this site when the folks at Narragansett clearly labeled it a Pale Ale? It certainly tastes more like a blonde ale, but if they're going to call it a Pale Ale, I'm going to rate it as such.","ryan1788a5","May 13, 2011"
4.35,18.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Would I buy more of it? - I would and I will. The price for a six-pack is hard to pass up and summer has just begun. The hottest days are ahead and this beer at 16 oz. a time is the way to go!","indiapaleale","May 13, 2011"
3.93,7.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"To be honest my first impression wasn't that great, but as time went on I did come to appreciate this one more. Poured into an 8 oz. tester glass, little head that dissipates quickly; nice light yellow/golden color. Smell is of citrus and those notes come through on the taste a bit. At first it tasted a little flat maybe, or lacking in any strong taste at all, but for a summer-y beer it's actually not too bad. The carbonation was certainly there. Nothing here blows me away though. Overall a crisp and refreshing beer that I could certainly drink a lot of, and isn't this the point of a summer brew?","billybrew21","May 13, 2011"
4.5,23,4,4,5,3,5,"O: Overall a very nice Summer Ale. Pretty excited about it, plan to buy lots more over the summer.","benbking","May 12, 2011"
4.02,9.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Finally. Finally a local brew better than Sam Summer! Quite a bit better, by my estimate. This beer is exceptionally refreshing and wouldn't lose character if it warms up on a hot day. Plus...I mean...tallboys!","OldIronLungs","May 11, 2011"
4.12,12.6,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"16oz Tall Boy (of course). Pours a translucent golden color with a half inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is of grains, floral hops, a bit of lemon and some cut grass. Taste is a nice crisp bite of hops upfront. Some breadiness along with a slight hint of lemon. Most summer brews have an abusive amount of lemon flavor but this one has only a bit and it works well in this beer. Somewhat sweet at the end. This is an outstanding summer beer. Great balance of taste and drinkability. 'Gansett's newest offerings have yet to disappoint. Overall, I will be drinking my fair share of these beers over the summer.","PicoPapa","May 11, 2011"
4.35,18.9,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"O/D- In order for a summer beer to score relatively high on my scale it needs to be light-bodied without sacrificing flavor. It obviously needs to be drinkable as well. I believe that this beer is an excellent summer brew. Unique taste combined with light body. Doesn't hurt that it comes in tallboy cans as well. Might be their best seasonal in my opinion. I will be drinking these all summer.","VelvetExtract","May 09, 2011"
