2.95,-13.7,3.5,2.75,3,2.75,3,"Pours a clear medium gold,with bubbles rising long afterwards, producing slightly more than a finger of frothy, shortlived, off-white head that leaves little lace. Aroma is very thin, a little cracker & pale malts, faintly fruity, a little citrus & faint grass. The wheat is detectable as an afterthought. Taste is thin biscuit & bready malts, some light toast & fruit, yeast, some wheat in the background providing a faint hint of banana in the lemon & bitter finish which intensifies in the bitter, mineral, chemical aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not quiet watery, moderate-high carbonation, crisp, prickly & dry. Overall a little disappointing with low drinkability for a Blonde Ale, a brew style with the reputation of being thirst quenching & easy to drink.","mothmanscott","Feb 08, 2015"

4.23,23.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Super fresh sampler pack these babies are best by 3/2012...this one pours a brilliant bright clear golden hue with a full thicket of egg shell white head. Frothing head dwindles down leaving layers of intricate lacing. Layers of cereal grains, light fruit notes, and floral hops come across my nares a very pleasant herbal grassiness as well. A perfect clean drinking gold ale really, nothing else to add other than damn it's refreshing and it's good cold and doesn't hurt to let it warm up. This is like the most solid homebrew gone pro brewer beer ever, simple flavorful and nails the style guidelines. A true session ale at 4.5% abv packs a nice amount of flavor into a poundable format, I've never seen this stuff outside of the sampler packs. Lighter bodied ale with ample sturdy carbonation really packs in the flavor and definitely pulls off an enjoyable beer in a style that most beer geeks don't give much attention to.","WVbeergeek","Nov 30, 2011"

3.62,5.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a golden color (surprise!) with one finger of head. The retention was not very good and the lacing sparse subsequently. The aroma was of light citrus, sweet breads, dry grains and a hint of green apples. The flavors were similar being mostly a compilation of citrus zest, dry grains and some sweetness similar to both caramelized sugars and sweet breads. Sort of like an amber ale, yet it claimed to be an American Blonde? The mouthfeel was a little thin, the body medium/light and the carbonation fine. An ok beer, but it seemed unsure of what it was trying to be.","thekevlarkid","0"

2.51,-26.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,"On-tap at Ale+Witch. The brew pours a translucent gold, capped with a thin wispy white head, and deposits a surprising amount of lace. The nose has very little presence, offering only something faintly metallic. The flavor seems better (initially) as it has a slightly fruity character atop a very basic beery profile. Succeeding quaffs get progressively more unpleasant, as the faint tropical fruity notes start to linger like a cheap Daquiri. I would not have another one of these.","ktrillionaire","Aug 07, 2011"

Pours a nice golden ale mostly clear, shiny topaz with a lasting small ring of cream and drippy lace. Nose is spicy grass and light fruit. Flavor is spiced, slightly tart fresh apple, a hint of toast, and dry grass. Near-medium body is well-balanced, mildly tingly with carbonation. Later on the finish shows some resiny wood and light citrus. Fine example of the style.","CuriousMonk","Jan 07, 2011"
