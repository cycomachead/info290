Not much if any hop aroma. The main difference between this and Canadian is that this being an ale, it does have some "fruity" tastes associated with it, as an ale should. It is a bit heavier than Canadian, as well. It tastes of sweet malt but the fruityness of it quickly takes over, but that too quickly fades into generalized macro aftertaste. Its OK for a macro ale.

I tried pouring it in different ways, and I still had foam. Also, I couldn't find any foods that went well with the Export. I even tried pizza with the Ex and it didn't complement it.
