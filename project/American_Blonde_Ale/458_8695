Aroma is weak & thin: light cracker malt with notes of grass, apples & maybe a little yeast. Taste is more substantial: sourdough bready, grain & biscuit malt, apple sauce & lemon & grass hints in a dry finish that yields a pale malt, hop bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is  light-medium bodied, moderately carbonated, crisp, prickle & dry. Overall a mediocre effort.","mothmanscott","Dec 27, 2014"

From a bottle the Fireman’s #4 doesn’t have the creaminess of the draft version, but is just as tasty. I had this Fireman’s #4 on a late afternoon and it was just what I needed to tame the heat. While some pilsners can be light and bright, I found this blonde to be bigger and bolder. The Fireman’s #4 is surprisingly deep and full on the palate.","brurevu","Sep 22, 2013"

It is in some ways similar to Real Ales Octoberfest when it comes to the nose. I love hopping back and forth between the two in a 22 oz mug, the wofts are euphoric, the warmer they get the better the stank. As the carbonation dies down the better the flavors come through. Real ale is underrated for sure, esp. if your a steady beer drinker. I like it, recommend it, and will drink it again. FYI its better than their rye, pale ale if your staring at the planogram and don't know which one to roll the dice on. Peace lkeys.","Astrosopher","Feb 26, 2012"

This was the first one I tried and it didn't knock my socks off, but it is a well made, easy going ale. Fireman's #4 poured a transparent golden straw color with a good bit of carbonation running through it. The 1 finger white head stuck around for a short while then receded to a film. The smell is of grains and a little bit of hops. Taste is similar, you get the grain in the front and it finishes with the hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin and bubbly for what I prefer in a golden/blonde ale. Drinkability is good. If you want to give something of much greater quality than their usual to your BMC friends, this is a good first step. Also, I think I honestly would have enjoyed this beer more in Texas, because a rainy Oregon winter doesn't bring out the better qualities of this beer.","gkunkle","Oct 30, 2010"

Mouthfeel is thicker and fuller than your average macro swill with a robust body and lingering earthy and grassy finish.

Overall a tasty brew by Real Ale. Not quite up to Southern Star's Blonde Bombshell, but it's a distant second.

The finish is slightly dry - which contributes to the overall drinkability of the beer. I've had this on bottle before and didn't like it as much; on draft you can taste a lot more.

Nothing too complex about the taste. Medium mouthfeel, being a little thicker than expected, but not bad. Light flavor and assumed low abv. makes this a very drinkable summer ale.

Herbal hop flavor, snappy bitterness, and an overall dryness come in the finish.
