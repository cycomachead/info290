Not as thin-bodied as some ales, this beer is creamy and delicious. I tend to like my beers a little more bitter than this sweet ale, but its a great drinkable beer.","MikeyLegend","Feb 17, 2015"

I'm not generally a big fan of blondes (at least not when it comes to beer...), but I really like this brew. I'd love it on a lazy summer afternoon. The fact that it is in cans also makes it that much more accessible to bring camping/hiking or to the beach or to a hayfield somewhere for a midsummer picnic. Grab a sixer if you see one and like the summer months. Well crafted and immensely enjoyable.","kemoarps","Jan 28, 2012"

But let's be honest, who buys a beer for these two charactistics alone? The taste factor dropped off for me because it had a strange lingering aftertaste that I couldn't put my finger on. Not repulsive, just weird. It didn't make me anticipate the next sip though. If you have no hair on your chest and this is a favorite style of yours, then give it a try.

The taste is again nothing too assertive, but is quite delicious: apricot, wheat bread, chewy yeast, some faint piny notes in the finish. It's a little like some Belgian pale ales -- reminds me a little of Taras Boulba. It's highly carbonated, which is perfect for its rather thick body.

Many times, I think that the BA reviewers are blind to the charms of beers with a milder flavor, but apparently this one bridges the gap. Positively delightful, and an incredible bargain to boot.","TuffLuff","Oct 31, 2009"
3.6,-3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D- Pretty easy to drink. Could see this being a great summer time session brew. I'm not normally a fan of the style but this is alot more like a hefe than any blonde I've had.","tatoodkelt","Oct 29, 2009"
4.34,17,3,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Upon cracking open the CAN, head began to foam up, as though it could not wait to escape. Pretty dang full CAN as it turns out. My aggressive pour resulted in a foamy, soapy two fingers of ecru head with good retention. The color was a really cloudy, extra-hazy honey-golden shade. Nose was an interesting mix of grassy hops and biscuity/bready malt. Mouthfeel was somewhat full, almost creamy with that same grassy/bready admixture of flavors on the tongue that I noted on the nose. Wild! The finish gave way to the bready/biscuity flavor which was just fine. Man, I really liked this beer and could definitely see it filling my cooler in the summer.","woodychandler","Oct 27, 2009"
3.47,-6.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"The beer is a bit bigger than the crisper versions of Blondes that appeal to me. The extra sweetness and fruitiness proves to much in the end. Thanks Exiled!","BEERchitect","Oct 21, 2009"
4.05,9.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Not a beer I would have sought out had I not heard the review on Craft Beer Radio; not sure this qualifies as a blonde ale, I think it is a very creative take to define a new style","brentk56","Oct 19, 2009"

4.1,10.5,4,4,4.5,3,4,"Dark cloudy burnished gold. The head is creamy white and leaves very nice lacing. Smells of hops, strawberries, and a subtle pine note. So far WAY up there on the canned beer scale. Taste is freakin awesome. Nice, nice balance of malt and hops, again, delicate hops and a faint strawberry taste. A sharp finish, not too assertive. Very very, very very nice. Mouthfeel is soft and a touch undercarbonated. Drinkability is very good. An afternoon in the making, for sure.","roblowther","Aug 14, 2009"

3.75,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Not bad. The beer has an interesting honey malt sweetness and a good hop flavor and aroma. However, there is a bit of fusel alcohol in this one which is sort of a turn off in a beer this light.","jasonjlewis","Jul 01, 2009"
4.3,15.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Cloudy, darker than a blond but lighter than an amber. It appears golden with a tinge of red. It produces a very small head, but it's dense enough to produce a nice lace. There's no noticeable carbonation. I get faint hints of cherry in the aroma. Nice balance between the malt, hops, and alcohol. A thicker mouthfeel than you would expect, a bit on the chewy side. Finish is also well balanced, with both sweet and bitter notes.","LittleDon","Jun 27, 2009"

4.37,17.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Hazy golden pour. White rocky head that fades into a thin lace. Smells of sweet pale malt. Faintly lemony, some floral smelling hops as well. Very inviting. Tastes of sweet malt tempered by a fair amount of bitter hops. Slightly bready, maybe even a little caramel. Grassy, floral hops make the beer fairly complex for the style. Medium amount of carbonation. The beer packs in a lot of flavor that you wouldn't expect from the style. Drinks very easy.","drunkboxer1","May 31, 2009"

4.41,18.9,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the can a hazy orange color, making the "Clarity is overrated" claim from the can spot-on. More lasting head than I've ever seen from a blond ale, and it even leaves some lacing. Smell is particularly malty and bold for the style, almost like a brown ale; sweet, caramely, and delicious. Taste is loaded with malty, bready goodness, and I taste a bit of apricot and orange fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, also unique in a blond, and leaves my mouth a bit sticky. In comparison to other blonds I've had, Bombshell is imperial-like in appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel, but at 5% ABV, drinkability is excellent. Such a great beer at a very low price... and in cans!","Riccymon","May 27, 2009"

3.57,-3.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4," Tastes exactly like it smells, like a cross between a Vienna and an American blonde with a big, biscuity yeast finish. Hops pervade all throughout, and all around it's a damn good balance between sweet grain and bitter hops.","mynie","May 18, 2009"

It doesn't taste or smell as good as a kickass IPA or RIS, but that shouldn't be what it's held up against. It's a blonde ale, and I can't think of another beer of the same style that I'd rather have. Great job Southern Star.","Reino","Apr 27, 2009"

3.87,4.3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass pale straw yellow with a nice thick white head. Lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is very fruity, suprisingly strong. Taste is very malty, with hints of various fruit flavors. The hop bite at the end leaves a slight dry feel, which is the only downer. This is going to be a great Texas Summer beer.","whoneeds8","Apr 20, 2009"
4.13,11.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Verdict: Perfect for sessioning, Bombshell is just a mild and friendly beer.

4.54,22.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Taste is very unique and tasty. It has plenty of husky, grainy maltiness and a noticeable hop presence. Sweet toffee and caramel flavors are followed up by a mild bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with no lack of flavor power. This blows away all other blonde ales I have had, which to me is a fairly weak style to begin with. I've already gone through 2 sixers and will be buying many more as it will make a fantastic summer beer. Love it.","twiggamortis420","Apr 06, 2009"

3.83,3.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy light copper colour with a minimal head that doesn't subside too much. The first thing I though when I stuck my nose into the glass was 'Dang it, I forgot to make bread today!'. There's an overwhelming smell of bread dough with some floral undertones and a malty sweetness. The taste is... not challenging. By that, I mean it's good but fairly middle of the road. Not too sweet, not too hoppy, not too bitter, and with a medium body. This style of beer (when brewed by a craft brewer) is almost craft beer with training wheels, and is hopefully a stepping stone for the macro beer drinker to develop a more discerning palate. For someone who drinks something like Arrogant Bastard or Sierra Nevada Torpedo, this beer will be as easy to drink as a glass of water, but for someone who wants to try something other than Budmilloors, it's a great first step into beer advocacy.","omnigrits","Mar 10, 2009"
3.85,3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Flavor starts off with some biscuity sweetness from the pale malts that combines with nutty notes along the way. Hops are fairly muted, but distinctively floral and saved for the back of the palate where they add a slight bitterness to the finish. Mouthfeel is solid, with a great carbonation level, medium-thin body, and a smooth (somewhat dry) finish that both refreshes and leaves me wanting another sip. This Blonde Bombshell did her job well; keep up the good work Southern Star!","wagenvolks","Feb 22, 2009"
