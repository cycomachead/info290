I pick up those citrus hops with some slightly bitter orange or grapefruit peel in the back end along with some herbal hop flavors. The malt adds a nice grainy backbone that isn't very heavy. If you told me this was a pale ale, I wouldn't have doubted it. The body is light to medium with strong carbonation. The finish is mostly clean and crisp. The drinkability is high.

Clean, dry malt palate on a dainty, smooth body. Hops are more flavor-forward than bitter; heavy tone of wild herbs compliments the dryness of the malt. Bit of yeast, though still very clean.

Nose of hay, light hops, some lemon, kind of "farmhousey". Lots of rustic in the flavor - definitely modeled after some of the better farmhouse ales out there, just nice and fresh, plenty of dry musty flavors yet nice and grassy, touch of citrus and a nice pale malt profile. Smooth and drinkable, certainly a session beer, uber quenching on this ballsoaker of a summer day.

Should have poured this one a bit less aggressively, the head was a bit too much in this case. Clouds of thick lacing are left behind that make for a good looking beer. Smell has lots of yeast notes, breadiness and some funk even (?). The nose also has some grassy notes from hops, the overall aroma could be stronger and have a bit more to it. Taste is good for a while but seems to degrade. It has a nice malt backbone in the aftertaste and yeasty notes up front. The hops are pretty bitter and lend grassy and floral notes, some citrus too. The flavors up front tend to disappear and the beer ended up tasting soapy to me (not my glassware's fault for sure). The mouthfeel had a light body and medium carbonation. A decent amount of cream helps the watery feel and the beer leaves a coat of bitter hops. Drinkability is decent. The beer has a decent taste and a good price.

The mustiness in the nose is a bit off putting just before the liquid hits your lips. Brightly carbonated, some lemon skin, seltzer-like, bland and im sure a bit past its prime.

Less so a Belgian blonde, this pours a nice hazy & chunky gold with fluffy white full head & nice sticky lace. The aroma is definitely a wheat beer with stale biscuit, lemon citrus & spice in the nose. The flavor is earthy, with a seasoned hay/sour yeast quality.

Taste is of bitter hops up front then moves in to grains, yeast and finishes with a high lemon smack to it.

There is a lemony bite right off the bat, with more bittering and acrid notes coming through at the finish. The beer tilts on the dry side, watery, thin, perhaps with a bit of sharp citrusy lemon zing. It's not that interesting, and I'm not sure what's supposed to be going on with this beer. There are some very subtle but harsh citrusy notes lurking in the background too. The aftertaste is a bit much as well. This is a one and done for me.

However, there was a nice thickness to the mouthfeel, a bit of a malt base to help the bitterness fade. It was quite refreshing, and it had a bit of snap, perhaps the two goals of a an american blonde.

4.16,28.4,2.5,4,4,4.5,5,"OK, I must admit I was skeptical at first of a beer called "beer of the gods" from Massachusetts that bills itself as a "Koelsch/Alt." I first had it on tap at Cambridge Common, but bought this sixer as I was coming back from a recent ski trip. It pours straw yellow and lightly hazy, with a half inch of bright white head that has some decent staying power. The aroma, surprisingly, is actually mostly malt, nice and toasty with a hint of sulfur around the edge maybe. Each sip opens with a bright German hop flavor, followed immediately by a bracing bitterness that somewhat overmatches the light body. As the sip evolves, the hop flavor returns, very strong but still smooth, like those noble hops are famous for. Hints of malt in the aftertaste - and that's it. By far the best part is the drinkability - the strong, smooth bitterness combined with a light body and relatively low alcohol make this a complete winner. I could drink gallons of it in a sitting. Tastes best in big gulps, even if I'm trying to have a sippin' session. I can see myself really getting into this one come springtime...","PeatReek","Feb 16, 2007"
