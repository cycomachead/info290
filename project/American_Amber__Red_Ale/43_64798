"4.02","+12.9%","4.5","4.25","3.75","4.25","4","Using a nonic pint (that's what's suggested by the label), a beautiful shade of red with a tannish head that was with me all the way to the bottom. Nose is fairly dank and spicy. Hop character is very vegetably, like a broth made with carrots, celery, and the like. I'd suggest this was related to the rye, but I've noticed this with Bridgeport's Conviction Pale Ale, Signature IPA, and Hop Czar Imperial IPA as well. In the red and the pale, it's tolerable, good even, but in the others it's overwhelming. Decently carbonated with a relatively high viscosity and a bitter, pepper-like aftertaste, this ale is surprisingly drinkable...in sips, not gulps...with a snack, which works well with the moderately high ABV.","Libeertarian","Mar 10, 2015"
