Deep amber/red with a thin white head that fades into a thin disc of foam. Smell is nice and malty, with a generous helping of hops as well. Taste is bitter and crisp hops, with a clean malt background that has a slightly odd sweet twang to it (horrific memories of Cortland Red Dragon are resurfacing) but it doesn't stay long enough to ruin the beer. Overall I think the hop flavor could be more complex, but it's a fine drinkable beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 07, 2013"

Light sweet pine and a little dank and oak as it warms. Taste is mellow and malt forward with toasty caramel, bread and grain. Toffee sweetness. Hops are oily and bitter with some light sweet pine, citrus and floral. Body is a little on the heavy side with a little butter and prickly carbonation.

He either didn't no his stuff or purposely screwed me. Pours a deep amber with a half inch off white head, that leaves some lace. Smell is carmel, pine, apricot, and grass. Taste is similar, with a kind of stale apricot and carmel finish, not bad for being a little old. Body is medium, enough life, not really dry, and drinkable enough. Will edit my review if I have fresh. I have been burned before when having someone pick it up or online orders. This is why I normally avoid getting IPAs or DIPAs with out someone giving the date.","SawDog505","Jul 03, 2012"

My nose is literally in the head and I can't smell a thing. At least it's clean and not bad smelling. Flavor is very familiar. Solid bitterness, not scorching or lingering. Body supports hoppiness of the beer, thin-medium w/ light sweetness. Sugar is caramelized - dark flavored. Minimal malt character. Hops are as advertised very "cascadie", with a citrus-grapefruit-must flavor. I enjoy this beer much more on the cooler side. Not surprised by the ABV, it does have an overall booziness. Fortunately, I'm a sucker for Big Hopped Red Ales. I would love to have a freshy from closer to the brewery, this one might be a touch old.","mlazzaro","Dec 05, 2011"

The head has good retention, and it leaves a sheet of sticky lace behind on the glass. The nose is of caramel malts and juicy fruits up front. There are some piney hop aromas that come out as well. Also, there are some notes of toffee, citrus, and a bit of earthiness. The taste starts off with some nice toasted malt flavor. There is also some good flavors of caramel, toffee, and there is a nice bit of fruitiness. There is some earthiness and a nice mild hop presence that comes through as well. The finish leaves a bit of lingering sweetness and mild hop bitterness. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a smooth feel to it. There is some good sweetness here that is nicely balanced out by the mild hop bitterness. There is some earthiness as well. There is some good drinkability here. I could easily drink a six pack of this. The flavor is really nice and it never gets boring. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and a good representation of the style.

Flavour finishes again malty, with more caramel notes. Some bitterness lingers. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

Pours a hazy red-brown color with a two to three finger creamy head of off-white to light tan colored bubbles, there is some effervescence in the glass and retains nice lacing throughout the session. There were aromas of citrus, pine and grapefruit hops with lots of caramel and malt, a good amount of caramel & dark honey sweetness as well. Flavors consisted of caramel, piney hops with caramel, light bread and grain malt. Has some good hop bitterness on the palate after the finish and give a good drying on the tongue. Mouthfeel is about medium with a bit of carbonation through out, a nice IPA with generous caramel accents. A nice upgrade over the more popular Flower Power in my opinion.","CuriousMonk","Mar 23, 2011"

From the pint glass this shows a slightly orange-ish brown wth a fair light oatmeal colored head that leaves a nice trail of lace. The aroma offers a pleasing malt vinegar and citrus brightness. The flavor is mellow caramel malt with a nice citrus bite that finishes bright with solid carbonation for a tingly and somewhat chalky feel. There's some grassiness to it, toffee and a vague smoke hidden in there. Just a very drinkable hoppy brew that is refreshing and satisfying. Nice to finally try it on tap.","Durge","Feb 23, 2011"

Medium bodied, with a resinous feel and assertive carbonation. Malty sweetness in the beginning, again with a hint of maple syrup.

I pick up some pretty decent floral and herbal tones from the smell, as well as some sweet and dark syrupy notes. Nice and complex. Taste starts off mellow, but quickly twists into a green, minty hops. Thus the feel is cool and smooth. Is that detritus taste from the yeast, ala Mendocino? The hops stay around at the end, along with some earthy barley backing. The malts are kind of subdued on this one - my only complaint. The beer feels just a bit flat and "round" as a whole, yet because of the interesting hops, it's pretty tasty. A favorite of the ambers that I've tried.","sixerofelixir","Dec 05, 2010"

Drinkability is good, I think it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think it's a good beer, I'd buy this again.","bluejacket74","Nov 16, 2010"

Color is deep orange in the light, enough that it appears brown. Lacing is very good, covering 90% of the glass. I'm assuming that Cascazilla is a portmanteau of cascade (hops) and Godzilla. I'm no expert at hops, but my guess is that cascade hops are important here. Aroma is light in spicy hops, brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of sweet malt with a very basic hop flavor. Bitterness -- not too much, not too little. Carbonation is I'm going into this review a little biased, as I am from Rochester, and LOVE Ithaca Brewing Company. This is one of my favorites from them. It is nothing that deserves to be on center-stage, but certainly a beer that others should check out.

Great earthy, herbal taste with just enough hop bitterness and malty sweetness. A very unique interpretation of the style that truly sets it apart from the standard Red.

The body is light with lively carbonation. The alcohol is masked well, but the watery body and active carbonation don't quite fit.

Poured dark copper into an American pint, with two fingers of white head, fair lacing, and fair carbonation. The smell was somewhat sickly sweet, with pineapple, blood orange, maple syrup, plum, and raisins all apparent. The taste confirmed the smell; very cloyingly sweet from start to finish, with pineapple and maltiness most prominent. The mouthfeel was nicely medium-bodied, with a good mix of carbonation. Given the smell and flavor, I expected the feel to be more syrupy. Anyway, one was enough for me. A little bit of a disappointment after all of the hype.","donniecuffs","Jan 27, 2010"

"4.39","+14.6%","4","5","4.5","3.5","4","12oz bottle in a pint glass. First off the only thing that makes this a red ale in my opinion is the color. It seems Ithaca already had an IPA but the head brewer wanted to make another heavy hop bomb so he created Cascazilla red ale. Color is a copper red like i think it should be. The smell is all hops and citrus, one of the better smelling bears i have had. I exspected the taste to be dominated by hops but you can tell the brewer spent time to balance this beer and not make it to bitter. It has a nice citrus bite to it but nothing to dominating like Torpedo in my opinion. Mothfeel is smooth with not to much carbonation. The alchol is masked very well and i could drink several of these easily. So far my favorite red ale i have had.","beer1018","Jan 25, 2010"

One of the more balanced beers I've had with regards not being well hopped but not numbing to the taste-buds. Mouthfeel tends to get a little aggressive carbonation-wise. Drinkability is good.

Aromas peeking through are nice cascade hop properties, grapefruit, mango and a nice zip of some malt sweetness. This one taste like your traditional red, a nice dose of malt is backed by a huge amount of fruity hops, nicely balanced and presented well to the palete. Nice carbonation on this one, the malt smooths it out a bit but the hops take over on the finish. I liked this brew alot, has great balance and was tasty to the last drop. Will defintley have this again, an awesome brew from the guys at Ithaca.","thespaceman","Mar 02, 2009"
"4.12","+7.6%","4","4.5","4","4","4","Thanks, once again, to Reagan1984 for tossing this in on a recent trade. Pours a nice, deep red color with a dense, foamy white 1 finger head. Decent lacing left as that head slowly recedes. Smells delicious! If you are a hop head like me that is, a strong, sweet citrus hops aroma. Oddly that strong hop punch is a little muted in the flavor, as the sweet malts of the red ale style kick in to balance the bitter out. As stated, this is a amber/red, so I guess I should roll back my hops hopes, but that smell was so strong. Nice complexity to the taste, though, with that sweet and bitter battle in your taste buds. Fair amount of carbonation holds me back from being able to take too many of these, but a nice, somewhat new take on the style.","bhalter8","Feb 25, 2009"

The taste once again in floral hops up front but finishes pretty watery. Its like a big burst of flavor that melts away into nothingness.

The smell was less hoppy than I'd hoped with the Cascazilla name, but actually pretty well put together for a hoppy amber ale. Lots of malt balances out the smell. Both components come through big in the taste, loads of ingredients but not really a mess, just strong flavors of hops with a solid malty backbone. The body could be a little thicker in my opinion, to complement the flavors, but it was OK.

Again, I like the hop presence in an amber ale. The ale has a moderate body with soft carbonation leading to a silky feel; finishes with a hoppy bitterness. One of the more flavorful amber ales.

Dark ruby red body with medium effervescence--uneven off-white brownish head in a pint glass, opaque but intimidating... robust hops intrude immediately, appropriate to the bottle's label...beautiful malt balance with spruce, toasted caramel and occassional peat scents for complexity...heavy, full-bodied, warming rush...actively effervescent and crunchy palate... "monster" hops early, mega malt late hammering like twin pistons on the tongue--rich, pucker-sweet and a bit of smoke(?)...BIG taste but again, balanced beyond the predictable "I ate a Christmas tree" feeling that we sampled from others at the event.

An odd fruity taste through the middle. Mouthfeel is on the viscous side for an amber, but I kind of like it. Drinkability is quite good, despite the viscosity of the brew.

A moderately dry finish. Maybe a bit overcarbonated, but I'm not put off by it. I find it hard sometimes to get really get into red ales, but this one's really good provided you're a fan of the hop.

"4","+4.4%","4","4","4","4","4","Pours clear and a moderately dark amber color with less than a finger light tan head that fades fairly quickly without much lacing. The smell is nice and strong, a rich caramel malty sweetness, almost syrupy, with a less prevalent floral hop character. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a slight bitterness from the hops, far from a hop-bomb that the "-zilla" leads on to be. Full flavored, the mouth and the nose are quite similar. Taste is malty but with less caramel than the nose, with a measured citrus hop character. My tastes have really changed and my memory is slipping; my first experience was draft and i remember thinking it had more of a hoppiness to it. I'm glad that i pulled this one off the shelf.

Flavors upfront with hop bitterness and flavor more pine tree bark earthy floral tones as well and yes the grapefruit appeal seeks through as well, barely any maltiness to balance out the aggressive nature of the hop additions this brew has to offer bitterness comes of somewhat one dimensional in the finish. Mouthfeel is in the light to medium body range pretty thin actually for all of the hop character this brew has to offer I was expecting more oily textures and carbonation packs a spritzy zing as well not as moderate as I would prefer from a brew like this. Drinkability is decent but I would get bored with no interplay between malt and hops the bitterness really lacquers onto the old palate and I could definitely go for some more balance here, decent overall worth a try of course.","WVbeergeek","Jun 01, 2007"

Little breadyness. The beer has malt but its nothing exciting or overly tasty. While some of the aroma hops comes through a little, the malts do nothing do contribute to the flavour.

This brew has a very generous amount of hops which makes it almost like an IPA. Color is a golden red with a foamy off -white head. Smell is hoppy/citrusy. Taste is bitter due to the hops with some sweetness as well due to the caramel malt. Definitely a unique ale, give this one a try.","BeerTruth","Jan 18, 2007"
"3.64","-5%","4.5","3","4","3.5","3.5","Poured chilled from a bottle into a pint glass it pours a copper color with ruby tint. A two-finger high frothy head sits atop of the body. After sustaining itself for a few minutes, the head leaves behind a clingy white surface layer with soem lacing on the glass. Aroma is mostly of hops on my nose first but followed by some slight fruity malts and a hint of toasted almonds. Sweet caramel hits my tastebuds first with a resin-hop flavor following that helps balance out the sweetness of the caramel. Maybe some slight fruit in there, but nothing to really write home about. Although this beer was rather sweet, a constant bitterness "lays in the weeds" and sneaks in throughout helping the balance. Without it, it'd be too sweet really. Mouthfeel is solid for the style. Prickly carbonation, as expected hits my tongue with a medium body. Maybe a bit of alcohol detected as well. Drinkability is solid, and it IS a tasty brew, but it may be just a bit too sweet drink more than a bottle or two. With a little more "Zilla" (hops) this one would balance better and be a ridiculously drinkable brew. Still, try it. I'm glad the beer matched the bottle.","Fish113d","Jan 01, 2007"

The aroma has a very enticing hop smell (citrus, grapefruit) that dominates but I am able to pick up a nice malt (toasted and caramel) scent in the background. The taste is actually quite smooth, for such a hoppy brew; actually the hop is not over the top but is clearly strong and dominant. Picking up a nice malt taste that has a sweet feel and goes well with the hops. With this being a red ale as highlighted on the bottle I guess I would expect to notice the malt a bit more and it is there. Over all this is a fantastic brew, not sure it lives up to its name as CascaZilla but is a great drink. One that I would grab at anytime!","Stimack","Oct 10, 2006"

Extreme grapefruit, sweet malts, maltball candies, extremely floral aroma. Then the sipping began and again a bright smile shone across my face. This is my kind of beer. Sweet maltiness with cascade hops all over the place. Grapefruit, piney, and a touch of brown sugar. Comparable to a DFH 90-Minute IPA "light" would be a good description. Extremely tasty brew. Mouthfeel is a medium, velvety body ending a bit dry. The carbonation is somwhere between light and medium...just enough to be subdued but enough to be noticed as well.

Some sweet malts arise in the finish, but struggle to bust through the stronger hop profile. a bitter citrus peel lingers. Even mouthfeel, but not too full.

There's also some nutty malt aromas underneath the hops. As would be expected, fruity hop notes dominant the taste of Cascazilla; the overall impression is of a slight sweetness at the front of the palate and a huge bitterness at the back. One nice twist this beer has is the caramel malt (being a red ale), which provides a nice undertone to the hops. This beer is medium bodied and very acidic. Not the most acidic beer I've had, but quite acidic nonetheless. This is the main drawback with this beer: its high acidity reduces the drinkability for me, and makes it unlikely that I'd want to order a bunch of these.","geexploitation","Jan 30, 2006"

If you like big hop aroma, this is for you. Hops punch through immediately in the flavor. Moderate toasty caramel malt, smooth on the palate, slathered with bright green hop juice. Big citrus and pine, moving into a boldly bitter, agressive finish. Great hop flavor, a little floral, with pungent citrusy notes. Orange and grapefruit. A high level of carbonation, perhaps a little too much for my tastes. Something a little milder would serve to increase the drinkability. Still pretty nice, though, especially after sitting a while. Lingering hop flavor. Really great stuff for a session, when you're jonesing for some hops. Great balance, weighted heavily towards the hops, but not so much as to be too challenging or overpowering. Not super complex, mostly a cascade hop showcase, but I don't think a beer has to be really crazy to be good. This one's excellent, I'd say.","UnionMade","Dec 31, 2005"

From what I've read this one is brewed with Cascade hops, and having cut my teeth on these western flowers, this beer kinda tastes like home. Very crisp, very hoppy, yet light. Something to drink on a hot summers day, if they're still making this fine brew by then.","Onceeven","Jan 10, 2005"
"4.22","+10.2%","4","4.5","4","4","4.5","The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a mildly malty scent with a boat load of Cascade hops, which were grown in NY. It is quite bitter and floral. The taste is good. It is refreshingly bitter and hoppy all the way through. The malts add a nice buffer and balance. It goes down easy and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great American red ale. I love the hops and the balance. This is a great offering from Ithaca; a good drinker.","WesWes","Jan 05, 2005"
"4.25","+11%","3.5","3.5","4.5","4","5","Nice crystal clear, ruby red body, moderate light tan head. Not much head retention. Lots of citrusy and flowery hop aroma. As the beer warmed, I could smell more of the sweeter malt. For all the hop aroma, the beer isn't nearly as bitter as I expected. It's much less hoppy than an IPA, and the bitterness doesn't stay around long in the mouth. It's actually pretty sweet tasting. There is a definite hop presence, just not as much as I expected from the bottle. For me, this isn't a bad thing, though, it's quite a drinkable and great tasting brew.","JackStraw22","Dec 23, 2004"
"4.2","+9.7%","4","4","4.5","4","4","There is also a nice sweet backbone, which coaxes a sweet orange flavor from the hops, and lends some caramel and toffee flavors. The mouthfeel is very rich, and does feel like a double IPA. Drinkability is high, would be an excellent session IPA. Good job Dan and crew...","bultrey","Nov 28, 2004"

"4.15","+8.4%","4","4","4","4.5","4.5","Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1" beige head above the dark copper brew. Head exhibits reasonable retention, with okay lacing. Aroma is slightly malty, with piney hops effects everywhere. Taste continues where the nose left off, slight initial malts, which quickly fall to the strong hops character. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent. Don't see that many sweet yet hoppy brews that are easily drinkable. This is one.","ppoitras","Nov 16, 2004"
"4.1","+7%","4","4","4","4","4.5","Like so many other very good new brews, I've been too busy enjoying Cascazilla to bother reviewing. It's one of those beers. Generally speaking I've been doing more drinkin and less geekin. But here goes...I am enjoying this crystal clear ruby copper colored beauty as I pen this nonsense. The cascade nose cuts through the senses and gives a clue of what's to come. This is a boldly hopped brew. But one dimensional it is not. Quickly shifting gears, the aroma turns caramel sweet. The first taste is sharp bitterness, smoothed out promptly by malty graham cracker goodness. Lingering, oily bitterness and citrus finish it off. The hop flavor is big too. Drinkability is outstanding. Big ups to Ithaca for this brew.","John","Oct 23, 2004"
"4.1","+7%","4","4","4","4","4.5","I have always enjoyed Ithaca beers, though they don't seem to get much recognition or respect as a great beer. Casczilla is a very easy to drink amber that makes anyone comfortable with it in their hands. A great session beer.","CBFanWish","Oct 18, 2004"

"4.47","+16.7%","4","4.5","4.5","4.5","4.5","Pours a clear mahogany color, with medium brown-white head. Smell is immediately attractive, deep and potent, composed of nutty, earthen flavors. Taste is excellent. First of all, the hops are extremely complimentary; they draw you into this beer, yet they dont have the sharp bite one would often find in highly-hopped beers. Meanwhile the malt is meaty and strong, filling yet still makes for a refreshing beer. A flavor hard to describe, but easy to compliment. Try this beer when given the opportunity  you will find yourself demanding more.","RocketWidget","Oct 18, 2004"

Not something I'd drink more than one of in a night, but hey--that's the point of creative brews. I keep wanting to take another swig to figure out the ever-elusive two or three tastes I can't name, but they don't come to me. This is a solid beer, and an excellent beer for a beer advocate; do you dig the distinction?","cooter","Jul 26, 2004"
"4.05","+5.7%","4","4","4","4.5","4","Bottles should be out mid to late September. They're billing it as a hoppy red ale made with 100% cascade hops. The label looks pretty cool, it's got a lizard breathing firey red hops along the bottom and the lettering (can't remember if it's Ithaca Beer, or Cascazilla) is a cut out of a waterfall picture.","HappyHourHero","Beers"
"4.38","+14.4%","4.5","4","4.5","4.5","4.5","Backwash: Maybe Im way off the mark, but this is now IBs best beer, aside from the super-limited Double IPA. Ithaca Beer has chosen to explore a fairly consistent (and I think very successful) house style rather than making another West Coast IPA clone. If you crave citrusy, grapefruity flavors, you might want to look elswhere; but youll be missing some pretty interesting, flavorful beers. I for one havent had too many American micros that really do finesse as well as Ithaca does, and these latest beers have improved upon the slight lack of flavor concentration apparent in some earlier beers (actually the whole line seems to have improved, especially the reformulated Pale Ale).","Dantes","0"
