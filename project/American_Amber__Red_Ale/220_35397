4.08,-0.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"I've had this sitting around for a while and finally decided to crack it open. This red ale pours a true red copper color with a thick and lasting off white head that leaves beautiful silky lacing. The nose is a delicious blend of sweet malts, west coast hops, and spice. The body is rather full with a pleasant carbonation and just the right amount of sticky sweetness. It finishes rather dry for such a malty ale. The flavor is a little different from the nose with a more pronounced spicy, peppery bite and an increased sweetness. This is a very good red. Knowing lagunitas and their love of hops, I want to try this fresh to see if there is a more pronounced hop character. This is very good none the less, just a tad sweet for what I expect from the brewer.","lochef81","May 07, 2014"

4.54,10.5,4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Easily one of the best concoctions to come from Lagunitas. The bottle caught my eye amongst the ever growing lineup of 24 oz. craft brews showing up around the supermarkets in California, and the uniqueness of the beer reflected the bottle art. Expecting something like an imperial red IPA, I was pleasantly surprised to find something much more mild and easily drinkable. Amber with tonal red accents would be better to describe the Mondo Large Red here. Only slightly sharp and tangy (or maybe zesty) characteristics, which is surprising considering the ABV. Overall I call the taste unique and perhaps complex - hops that will remind you of a well brewed IPA rather than a red. A nicely palatable fall beer that pairs well with a hearty roast pork loin meal.","LABrewjourneyman","Nov 10, 2013"
4.06,-1.2,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Overall, I have to concur that this is a good value. Reminds me of a lighter version of Double Bastard or the Heavy Seas Big DIPA I had a couple days ago. Basically a solid (and cheap) entry into the American light barleywine category.","Mongrel","Nov 10, 2013"

Not really dank, after all, but mildly bitter behind sweet nutty malt grains. Notes of caramel and treacle syrup that never become too pronounced. Tastes fresh with a zippy pep of implied spice. Totals out with some fumage from the almost 9% ABV. Dangerously drinkable in its smoothness. Warms the belly, which can't quite catch up to the tongue's warning. Body has some stickiness, but retains a creamy nature that is a big positive for the feel. Carbonation is mostly soft, with some collective sizzle under the lips. Nice beer.

The nose is basically all malt, but the body of the beer showcases the hops. The malt is all but lost until the finish--I found a malty and hoppy aftertaste with this beer. Somewhat dry finish. Kind of an odd beer, I think, but very good. I don't have a lot of points of comparison with this one. It smells like a pale ale, hits like a scotch ale, and finishes with the bitterness of an IPA. In any event, I'm not complaining.","Wukk","Aug 21, 2013"

The initial taste was signature Lagunitas' grapefruit and citrus hops and I knew I was going to enjoy this beer. The flavor had much more depth than the initial hop love. There were notes of caramel and toasted grain malts underneath the tropical fruit, citrus and apricot hop flavors. The taste profile was deep and varied and took my palate on a ride with each sip.

There's sweetness on the front. On the middle. And almost equally (a bit of bitterness from the 76 IBUs is there) on the back. Hits your tongue with an incredibly creamy mouthfeel, and then your mouth just gets covered in glorious red ale goodness. This may be (or is really close to) the best red ale that I've ever had. It has all those sweet "red" flavors you'd expect, but there's a nice, signature Lagunitas hop-bite on the finish. I've heard some describe this beer as drying, but I don't often find any beer as sweet as I find this one to be drying... I guess I'd only go as far as saying it's semi-dry. There's about 9% ABV on this, and the alcohol basically doesn't come through at all. The aftertaste has a very slight warmth or trace of it, but I don't think the average beer drinking would have any idea that this is clocking in at nearly 9%.","Alextricity","Aug 07, 2013"

Being an IPA drinker, I loved the presence of hops. The taste was excellent. Smooth with a nice bitterness to it. The taste leaves you craving more. As you drink, it leaves a nice lacey finish around the glass. Definitely the best amber ale that I have had. It's actually going down a little too smoothly!

Taste again was hops forward that lingered for a bit on the tongue, the malt stepped up right after that for a nice finish that left the mouth clean and without hop bitter. Mouthfeel was clean and after the hops flair, smooth and well rounded. Overall it's a good brew but the hop smack reminds me of most of the Lagunitas offerings...not a bad thing really but I would've liked a tad more malts and sugars peeking out instead. Great price for a bomber and I try any beer at least once, at $4.50 a Bomber how can you say no?","Bear1964","Jul 17, 2013"

Aromas of big orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange rind, floral, pine, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, floral, orange rind, caramel, toast, pine, grass, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, floral, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance that doesn’t overpower the hoppiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy imperial red ale. All around great balance and complexity of hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering as expected from this brewery.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

Fuller body, creamy, and smooth on the palate while finishing fairly bitter but sweet also. Alcohol is warming and a little hot at times, but overall this is a stellar big red - one of my favorite pseudo-styles.","barnzy78","Jun 01, 2013"

4.18,1.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4," The flavor has a tangy synergy of yeast and hops with tropical taste of grapefruit and mango with some light vegetal elements leading me to believe this was dryhopped. There is an orange rind element in the taste which brings a zesty overall taste with some sweetness in the malt support and alcohol boost. The hops have a nice flavor and slight grassiness but still seems to blend well with the yeast flavor. Overall I think this is a great beer for the value - very juicy hop flavor and the only drawback to have multiples is the elevated alcohol level.","Slatetank","May 21, 2013"

4.15,1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear golden color. There is a discernable peach tint as the beer leaves the mouth of the bottle and waterfalls into the glass. A foamy, off white head appears and lingers, but for no longer than the average ale. There is a wonderful, rich aroma of butterscotch offset by sweet citrus. Creamy mouthfeel that almost seems misplaced. A mild scrubbing appears on the rear of the tongue, likely due more to hop heat than carbonation, as the beer finishes. The flavors are complex. Not necessarily complimentary, but interesting. Sweet, bold malt brings an undeniable, vibrant toffee flavor, followed immediately by some pretty obtrusive hop resin. This is a pretty large effort on the part of Lagunitas for number 13. I like it because it is irreverent and disrespectful, but quite good.","DocJitsu","Jul 27, 2012"
