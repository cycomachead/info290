The aroma starts to develop a bit as it warms, with light sweet malt aspects. Unfortunately, the taste remains pretty lackluster with just some nondescript sweetness and a little earthy quality. The body does have a nice weight and feeling to it on the palate, (lighter and smooth). This was one of the first craft beers I ever tried back in early 2000s and unfortunately, it hasn't held up in comparison.","delta490","Aug 21, 2014"

It's good for those times you want something just a little heavier than your standard pale ale. It does however, have that special "wow factor" that makes a beer noteworthy, and for that I recommend it.","Aaron_Ramson","Jul 12, 2013"

However, the flavor is a *lot* less pronounced than the nose had led me to expect, but contained exactly the same elements.

The aroma was mild... almost nonexistent, with mild hops and a faint citrus smell. The feel is pleasant and the taste is unassuming... somewhat dry with a hops finish. Not my favorite ale, and it's probably just personal preference but I prefer my ales with a bit more hops.

The mouthfeel is light and dry. Mendocino Red Tail Ale is an okay beer, slightly recommended.","B967ierhunter177","Oct 18, 2011"

It's medium bodied with low carbonation and a lingering finish. This is an enjoyable and well balanced brew, drinkable on any occasion.","JMad","Oct 16, 2011"

The nose comprises caramel, mandarin orange skin, light lemon rind, and a few drops of maple syrup. The taste focuses a bit more on the citrus than the sweets, but not by all that much. Other than that, things are pretty much the same. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish.

Some wet grains, floral tones, and honey-like sweetness. The mouth is crisp and carbonated well. Easy-drinker. At the first fews sips this beer carries a worthy amount of bitterness, but as I continue to sip, this fades. Really tame flavors as well. Caramel-like flavors, grassy notes, and a bready finish. The way this presents itself, I'd say this is more characteristic of a Pale Ale or something of the sort. An easy-drinking beer though.

A bit abrasive as a whole, this is not the beer I recall years ago when I tasted Red Tail Ale, things have gone in a bad direction eversince they were bought by the Kingfisher Indian mogul. Mouthfeel is cloying with earthy bitterness, body is medium bodied carbonation doesn't carry things well just an unpleasant experience.

There is some malt, a little bit of hops and none of it is strong or interesting enough. The mouthfeel is fairly watery with too little carbonation and a bitter aftertaste. Despite the beer's faults, it's fairly drinkable. The numbing metallic taste is starting to make an argument for me to further lower the score, so I'll end it there.

When I first had this beer some weeks ago, I wasn't that impressed, but the beer grew on me as I slowly worked my way through the six pack I bought for $7 at the local Trader Joe's. I has a more pronounced malt character than say Sierra Nevada. Also, it has a pine character to the hops, while other pale ales (Sierra Nevada, etc.) have a stronger citrus based bitterness.

Also can notice some hop taste but seems just to be there to balance out the beer and is welcome. Over all I would not classify this as a great brew but is solid.

Chewy caramel malts and floral citrusy hops on the nose, it's somewhat faint but a nice blend. Sweet malt upon first sip, some grains, with citrus making an appearance in the middle, and mild floral/piney hop finish. Sticky, oily hop aftertaste. Yet this red ale has an absolutely amazing full, creamy mouthfeel, wholly unexpected for this style, which leaves me duly impressed, it is a textural pleasure to drink this ale, a damn palatal masterpiece, worth the price alone.

A hoppy aroma with light citrus notes is accompanied by a subdued malt aroma that is just perceptible as well. This beer is nicely hoppy at first, it then leads to a thin body, which I don't remember from prior sampling of this beer. As it warms up the hops start to kick in and bury the thin-bodied sensation. This beer has a definite American hop character in it, there is a bit of citrus character and it is pretty bitter. This one really needs to be had on the warm side of things, otherwise the character is lost and it tastes too thin.

Not a bad beer, but nothing really stands out about it either.","Dogbrick","Mar 04, 2003"
3.27,-5.2,3.5,4,3,3,3,"This beer holds its own but isn't my favorite from Mendocino. The head is thin but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is mostly malt. I enjoy the smell better than the taste. The taste is a little weak and doesn't have a lot of body. At times it seems more like a lager then a pale ale. The basic direction of this beer is lost. If it is a pale ale, then what about the other pale ale they brew? The beer is good but not what I expect from an ale. Lots of malt and a bizarre yeast strain that doesn't seem to fit the style.","Maestro","Feb 20, 2003"
3.98,15.4,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"It is now brewed in Ukiah, CA but the original brewpub is in Hopland, CA. With a home town by that name it has to be good. The brewpub is great, welcoming to tourists but with a hometown following. One of the regulars even has his own chair at the bar, complete with a plaque. If you are ever cruising up the 101, drop by, you will not be disappointed.","Bang34","Feb 06, 2003"
3.18,-7.8,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear light-tea color with a 1-½ finger slightly off-white head. The smell is a light roasted malt aroma with light hops in the background. Again the taste reveals roasted malts and light hops (perhaps too light IMO). It has a light-bodied mouthfeel and finishes barely on the dry-side. A very basic amber that is not very enticing. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jan 31, 2003"
3.7,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Hazy, dirty amber shade; off-white head, moderate size, minimal lace. Orange zest, nuttiness, malt, citrusy-hops construct the nose. Respectable flavor, cameral malts rule, nutty, surprisingly acidic and hoppy nice finish. Medium body; silky smooth because of the mild carbonation. Far from outstanding, it would work well as a session beer. Try one.","bditty187","Jan 30, 2003"
4.02,16.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"This is one auspicious looking beer. With a delicate poor, this nebulous orangish light brown colored beer with a thin white head and mild carbonation is pleasing to the senses. A congenial sweet smell of nector and a gratifying first sip, signify a sencond and third taste are undoubtfully near. Drink up and enjoy, for there are five more tails within your reach.............Make that 4.","Tubesox","Jan 19, 2003"
4.07,18,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a thin white head that immediately fades into a thin lace. Nose is fruity with notes of fresh citrus and some floral hops. Taste is a combination of sweet lightly toasted malts and juicy ripe orange. Oily and bitter hops follow the initial taste and leave an acidic and off-dry finish. Very crisp and refreshing. I really enjoyed this ale and will buy more again soon.","Morris729","Jan 13, 2003"
3,-13,3,3,3,3,3,"On the pour a nice copper color with the head presumptuous in volume, light tan in color and the texture frothy, upon the decomposition of said head the lace forms a thick sheet to secure the glass. Malt dominated nose, malt sweet, light floral tones also present, and the start sweet with nice malt profile, the top middling. Finish has perky acidity with the hops pleasantly spicy, the aftertaste dry, long lasting and a nice Session beer.","Gusler","Dec 21, 2002"
4.17,20.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Red Tail Ale:  Brown long neck bottle.  Reddish hue and creamy white head, with nice Belgian lace.  Aromatic, with strong hints of apples. Initial taste gives way to a prominent hop flavor, with some hoppy oils that last a fairly long time.  This is a damn fine beer.","jackndan","Nov 05, 2002"

3.53,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy copper color with a spectacular off-white cloudtop head with excellent retention, and quite good lace, mild carbonation.  The head lasts to the bottom of the glass.  The aroma consists of malts, hops, and bread.  Taste begins with caramel maltiness, hops then assert themselves towards the middle, finishes with a dry crispness and bitter citrus flavors.  A decent and solid amber ale.","Pegasus","Aug 25, 2002"
3.45,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Decently hopped with a slightly toasty back. Finishes citrus rind and clean but lacks body and has only a whisper of malt for balance. I found myself rather uninterested in the six I bought and it took awhile to finish. A cut-hair above thoroughly average.","inebrius","Aug 20, 2002"
3.01,-12.8,4,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice pour, head is a consistent 1/4 inch of medium bubbles. Murky amber color. A little hoppiness and "wet canvas" to the smell. Not well balanced, hops are tangy and somewhat explosive. Some creaminess to the malts that adds body. If I have a major criticism, its in the lack of complexity of the malt sweetness, and way too much vinegary funk going on, piling on with the hops. Drank a second one directly from the bottle and it was extremely sour in this presentation. I'd like to try it on tap to see if there are a number of bottle runs that are not well-done...","ADR","Aug 15, 2002"

3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Sweet malt nose with some dry hop presence.  hazy red color with a nice lasting 1/4 inch white head.  White lace on the glass.  Initial toasted malt flavor  with a smooth mouth.  The finish has a hint of cardboard (oxidation?).  Overall except for the touch at the finish a solid beer.","frank4sail","Aug 12, 2002"
3.6,4.3,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Overall, a pretty good amber, and distinctive from the rest of the pack.  Flavors were not as well integrated as I would hope, and the alcohol element at the end was heavy handed.","Brent","Jul 01, 2002"
3,-13,3,3,3,3,3,"This beer was easy to rate for me, it's not bad but then again it doesn't really make you want to buy a case of it.  As you can see how I rated it its a very aveerage beer all the way around, not bad not great.................CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 26, 2002"

3.99,15.7,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"After about a minute, the head dissapates almost completely leaving just enough to leave a sparse pattern down the glass.  Slightly hazy light orange hue.  The citrusy but mild hop nose is accompanied by very pleasant caramel and nutty malt notes.  Light to medium in body, with a smooth mouthfeel.  There's a nice balance of flavors all around in this brew.  The hop bitterness sufficiently balances the malt sweetness.  Malt flavor, although certainly not assertive, is comprised of a caramelized sweetness contributed by the crystal malt.  There's nothing offensive about this brew at at all.  It's simple, well balanced and is thus very drinkable.","marc77","Apr 02, 2002"

It costs nearly $9 a 6-pak in Cambridge, MA ... but man is it worth it. Another fine ale from Mendocino Brewing Co. Buy some now.","Todd","Oct 21, 2000"
