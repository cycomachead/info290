"3.44","-10.9%","4","3.75","3.25","3","3.5","Overall: This is not the red ale im accustomed to. The hop and malt varieties dont work together, and are all over the place. It also has a gritty and very dry mouthfeel; Overly carbonated. I love a great red, such as Nugget Nectar and lagunitas, but this is far from those. I thoroughly enjoyed Mongo, but im very dissapointed with this offering. It was actually hard for me to finish","Bone53","Feb 01, 2015"
