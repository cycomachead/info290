The nose comprises toasted caramel, dark greens, pine resin, and celery. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is less toasted, the pine is stronger, and some grapefruit peel has been added. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice impy red, one that's not ashamed to be pleasantly balanced.","TMoney2591","Nov 15, 2012"

The head is big, rocky, and mountainous, with sticky fat globs of lacing moving up the sides of the glass in web-like patterns. The beer smells very bready with a great smattering of piney hops with hints of citrus. Caramel malts are also obviously present and enticing, just as any red ale should be. The beer tastes fantastically balanced. It opens with sweet caramel and malts before opening into big pine and grapefruit bitter notes which transitions into the aftertaste which mingles the hops bitter citrus-pine with the bready malts to make a mellow bitter linger and sweet touch. Mouthfeel is clean and medium bodied, with light effervescence from the carbonation, which helps to cleanse the palate. The mouth is left slightly dry on the tongue and roof, with just a trickle of saliva to leave the mouth calling out for more liquid nourishment. Overall this beer is a lovely sipper. I must admit that I love hoppy imperial reds, and this is very nice hoppy red. Granted, the hops are a little mellower than other reds I have sampled, this ale still holds great grapefruit and other citrus notes, and definitely kisses the mouth with sweet caramel and bread malts in a perfect balancing act with the hoppy bitters. Try this beer! It is most likely my favorite of Beer Camp this year.","Maxwell","Oct 12, 2012"

A hint of rye sourness. I was expecting a more intense hop flavor from the aroma, but instead the malts and hops are very nicely integrated.

Nose expresses citrus, rind and earthy spice with a suggestion of caramel malt in the background. Taste reveals an herbal/resinous character on a malty backbone; however, the hops quality definitely asserts itself more than the malt. There's a slight, rind-like bitterness at the finish that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a brisk carbonation and a slight oiliness.

I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Imperial Red Ale, and I would for sure recommend giving this beer a try. All in all I was quite pleased with this beer and it delivered just about everything that I would want from the style, it's a really solid beer and so far my second beer from the Beer Camp series, so far I am liking this series and I can't wait to see how the other two are.

Sweet dark fruit and caramel up front roll over the tongue into the balancing hop act. Balance is actually impeccable. Strange and unique layers of flavors that somehow meld together into on interesting sip. You also can't detect a whiff of that 8%. Pretty damn good. But i'm a sucker for imperial reds.","jtierney89","Beers"
"3.7","-2.6%","4","4","3.5","4","3.5","Deep red colour, finger of off white head with some lace left behind. Smell is a mix of citrus and malts, big juicy grapefruit and orange, sweet malts and some biscuity caramel. Taste is also a mix of malt and hops, moderately sweet, citrus fruit mid palate, grapefruit and earthy hop, quite bitter throughout with a long malty finish. Light-med carbonation, oily and fairly full bodied. The 8% alcohol goes largely undetected, nice hoppy red ale that may be a touch too sweet, still a smooth drinking beer.","peensteen","0"

The nose has some mild citrus notes, but there is also a malt presence. The flavor is a well balanced mixture of caramel malt and hops. The hops are not overdone, but they are certainly featured on the finish. Considering this offering clocks in at slightly above 8%, the alcohol is well hidden among the solid flavors.","57md","Aug 20, 2012"

The flavor is assertively bitter up front, again with tea like hops and some english malts. Then followed up with some pleasant creamy sweetness (which is fleeting) and then some lasting ESB character. I like. Medium on full bodied with prickly, moderately hi carb and an off-dry finish. Nice beer. Once annually would be nice.","harrymel","Aug 17, 2012"

"4","+5.3%","4","4","4","4","4","12oz bottle from the recent mixed Beer Camp 12 pack. Red, clear, sticky head, Smells super malty. I always expect imperial reds to be super hoppy but this relied more on malts to produce a solid beer. Smells sort of like coffee, yum. Taste has the slightest hint of coffee followed by malts and a touch of hops. This might be the best beer in this mix pack. Solid.","ArrogantB","Aug 17, 2012"

The caramel and roasted malt flavor is stronger than the aroma would let on. The grassy and floral hop mixes with a slightly bitter alcohol taste to ride on top of the sweet roasted malt flavors. Medium-heavy body, a bit of syrupy and oil, low carbonation, and a bitter finish. Another good beer out of this bunch. Maybe a bit on the sweet side for my tastes, but well crafted.","Kromes","Beers"
