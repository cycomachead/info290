Maple...Autumn Red...lebeling all gave way to hops. Enough with everything being hopped up. Spare me.","seedyone","Mar 11, 2015"

Certainly different from the 'usual' American styles (think in terms of heavily hopped IPAs and the like) but ultimately nothing particularly special. Worth tracking down if you fancy something a bit different but I feel that the maple syrup angle is somewhat overdone in that there's not actually enough of it","interzen","Feb 08, 2015"

Aromas of toast & biscuit, caramel, tangerine, a hint of tropical fruit & floral earthiness. Taste is toasted biscuit, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple, pear, pepper, hints of pine resin & floral earthiness. I don't pick up the maple but it may be lost in the toast & caramel. Finishes with toast, pine, orange & floral earthiness which dominate the bitter & lightly drawing aftertaste. Nicely balanced for an amber ale & a very hoppy example of the style. Odd but nice & quite good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, creamy but slightly oily/slick, finishing wet, lightly prickly & astringent in the aftertaste.","mothmanscott","Jan 15, 2015"
