Aromas of toast & biscuit, caramel, tangerine, a hint of tropical fruit & floral earthiness. Taste is toasted biscuit, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple, pear, pepper, hints of pine resin & floral earthiness. I don't pick up the maple but it may be lost in the toast & caramel. Finishes with toast, pine, orange & floral earthiness which dominate the bitter & lightly drawing aftertaste. Nicely balanced for an amber ale & a very hoppy example of the style. Odd but nice & quite good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, creamy but slightly oily/slick, finishing wet, lightly prickly & astringent in the aftertaste.","mothmanscott","Jan 27, 2015",
