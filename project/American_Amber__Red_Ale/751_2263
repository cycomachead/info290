Not very aromatic in general. Tastes of coriander and moderate bitterness accompanied by a malty finish. Smooth mouth feel with some carbonation. Somewhat acidic feel on front of tongue. Leaves a mildly drying sensation, with very slight chewy character. Overall, good winter style ale that is not overwhelming to palate and easy drinking. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable nonetheless.","sporklift87","Feb 15, 2015"

The palate is creamy, fruity, with some bread, citrus and light melon. Light sweetness on entry that dries out by the finish with light traces of astringency. It has a medium body and carbonation. The carbonation is natural and not harsh. Easy to drink.","pat61","Feb 05, 2015"
