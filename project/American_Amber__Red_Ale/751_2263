Not very aromatic in general. Tastes of coriander and moderate bitterness accompanied by a malty finish. Smooth mouth feel with some carbonation. Somewhat acidic feel on front of tongue. Leaves a mildly drying sensation, with very slight chewy character. Overall, good winter style ale that is not overwhelming to palate and easy drinking. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable nonetheless.","sporklift87","Mar 09, 2015",

The palate is creamy, fruity, with some bread, citrus and light melon. Light sweetness on entry that dries out by the finish with light traces of astringency. It has a medium body and carbonation. The carbonation is natural and not harsh. Easy to drink.","pat61","Mar 03, 2015",

It looks weak and I think it is really what's  holding it back in the ratings...it has a nice spicy brown ale profile with a slightly sweet honey punch up front.  Cloves, cinnamon mix with the warmth of the alcohol with a somewhat dry bitter finish.  Could use a little more carbonation but over all not bad...","Boca-X","Feb 15, 2015",
