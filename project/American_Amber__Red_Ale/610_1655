What would have been an extremely high beer fell down under 4 because the bitter was to much, took away from the tasty.  If you are a hop head, this one should be right in your wheel house.","JamieDuncan","Nov 24, 2014"

Multiple layers of flavor play across the palate as you drink this beer. I like the subtle drying finish. This is a beer I would recommend to someone who likes hop flavor but not the bitter bite of an IPA. It is one of the best examples of the style I've had, without a doubt.","slusk","Jul 20, 2014"

Aroma is deep and inviting--malt, caramel, fruity, with mild floral hops. Flavor starts with malt and caramel, some toffee, nicely balanced, with moderate citrus hops finish. Mouthfeel is medium thin. Overall this is a really outstanding red ale, I really like it!","Dsimenson","Jul 11, 2014"

Definitely a malt- forward beer. Though I'm not a major fan of coffee, it was a manageable and balanced coffee flavor. Got a little sweeter as it warmed, which cut the coffee well. I might have scored this a little lower because of that coffee, but I'd also like to think I was more unbiased than that.","ToriBug13","May 14, 2013"

It is very hoppy and very west coast. The hops are sharp and quite piney. There is a bit of citrus in there as well but its very piney and has a nice dry finish. There is little malt flavor that sneaks past the hops but a subtle toffee and caramel flavor if you look for it. This beer has a pretty light feel and is easy drinking. A solid hopped up red.","TwelveOunces","Jan 21, 2013"

A lot of reds in my experience are hazy, this one is not. I don't consider that a plus or a minus; just something to note. The beer looks gorgeous, so whatever. Strong fruitiness on the nose. Smells of burnt cherry, marmalade, and graham cracker. The latter being the toasted malts, I suppose? On the first sip I got sour cherry, cappuccino (which was weird) and lots of hops. Unfortunately I also got some shallow, yet apparent, metallic notes, which were definitely not desirable. On subsequent sips the weird coffee notes disappeared and more of the caramelly malts showed through. The tinny metallic taste persisted but was more of an annoyance and not overpowering. Still there was the strong hops bitterness intruding on the finish; over done a bit I think. Overall the beer is very well crafted, but could be more well balanced with either less hops or more malts. Otherwise what are we brewing here? A Red or an IPA? I can't tell. Anyway I still recommend trying this beer, and will try it again myself. Paired with a sweet food like BBQ sauce (chicken/pork) this beer is probably fantastic.","Kevin73","Jan 20, 2013"

Taste: pine, herbal, minty, caramel with some toasted bread and date-like sweetness getting overpowered with a piney and herbal finish. Creamy, medium bodied feel gives way to a dry, slightly powdery, finish.

This beer actually smells exclusively like any good Scotch ale should, but the difference comes when you get to tasting it. The malts are a bit milder and sweeter than the traditional style, which is where the blending comes in. The hop inclusions are a nice addition, but we wish they had been more robust in the nose, which would have given it the edge we were looking for.","TheBrewo","Apr 19, 2012"

There is a good amount of sediment seen floating in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of caramel malt and herbal hops on the finish. There is a pretty assertive and almost medicinal bitterness that sticks around after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel.

"4.13","+2%","4.5","4","4","4","4.5","Out of a bottle this beer was a gorgeous red color with ruby highlights. The one finger of khaki colored head retained itself well and left consistent lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, bready malts, grassy hops and little brown sugar. The flavors were just as balanced as the aroma with the caramel malt and herbal hops perfectly accentuating each other. I also tasted toffee, a bit of citrus hops and a bit of pine. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation light. Very sessionable and an excellent example of the style.","thekevlarkid","Nov 04, 2011"

I really enjoyed the hoppiness this amber/red ale possesses.","Mahlik","Nov 03, 2011"
"3.7","-8.6%","3.5","3.5","4","3.5","3.5","This brew poured out as a nice looking clear red color with a white fizzy head on top. The lacing doesn't stick too much but it holds a decent retention. The smell of the beer is hoppy, there is a sweet malt backbone to the beer also. The taste of the beer is much like the nose, it's hoppy and sweet all at the same time. The mouthfeel gives off some bitterness and a dry feeling after the swallow. Overall this brew is pretty good, I would drink it again if I was in the mood.","Knapp85","Nov 02, 2011"
"4.18","+3.2%","4.5","4","4.5","3.5","4","Overall I thought that this was a pretty good Red Ale. It was on the hoppy side for a Red Ale, but it had a nice caramel malt backbone to balance out all those hops. I found this beer to have good drinkability, I wouldn't mind drinking another one, but after two the bitterness might wear on me. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it was heavy on the hops but the caramel malts kept them in check nicely and when combined they made for a pretty good flavor. What I liked least about this beer was the body, it wasn't bad but it felt just a little watery and would have been perfect with a medium amount of body to it. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good Red Ale, the hop profile seems like it would make for a good Red Ale to drink during a warm summer afternoon. I would recommend trying this beer if you are a Red Ale fan or if you like hoppy beers, it's a good example of how well a Red Ale can hold up to a bunch of hops. So far I would say that this is one my favorite Red Ales, I like it slightly better then Cow Catcher, it tastes similar but this beer has a heavier and better tasting hop presence. This was another great beer from Bear Republic, so far every beer I have had from them has been pretty top notch and it seems like they got a knack for the hops, I will have to move on to some of their bigger bottles next, I know what they can do with hops but I am interested to see what they got in store when it come to darker beers, looks like I am gonna have to try Big Bear Black Stout next, I have high hopes, good job Bear Republic.","StoutHunter","Oct 31, 2011"

Surprising amount of boozey flavor for the beer that isn't all that high in the ABV department. Somewhat resinous. Dry mouthfeel. This one grew on me. The more I drank the more I liked it.

The finish is balanced with raisinette malt and I am left with a alcohol warming sensation as this sweet juice goes down. The best of both worlds here. The great flavor of a red, with ample hops, and crisp finish. This is, by far, the best amber ale I've ever had. Simply an amazing brew. Bear Republic can do no wrong in my eye.

"4.35","+7.4%","4","4","4.5","4.5","4.5","Overall: Wow! THIS is an amber ale?! According to the Bros, it's hybrid of sorts - although I'm somehow thinking of Flanders reds, and not Scottish reds - and I couldn't agree more. The bottle conditioning really allows this thing to be a flavorful experience like no other. Bear Republic once again shows the beauty and future of American craft brewing in this rather intense beer of their's. Due to its heaviness, it's not something I could sit and have any day, but it's quite recommended!","magictacosinus","Jul 26, 2011"
"4.65","+14.8%","4.5","4.5","5","4","4.5","Close to as perfectly balanced as could be I think. Its rich and flavorful from the dark roasted malt character, but the hops come in and accent them so well that the two tastes combine perfectly into one really great taste. Pine hops rule in the back but the caramel character felt in the malt front is so understated that it becomes a work of art. Some booziness in the taste as well, especially detectable once its warmed up a bit. I think if this were ever so slightly more carbonated, the beer would be a bit more crisp, but this starts with a creamier mouthfeel and ends closer to the crisp side. Really, even the carbonation is nicely balanced. Overall, this goes right alongside Hop Rod Rye and Racer 5 as a few in my top 20 favorite beers.","chodinheaven","Jul 19, 2011"

Medium bodied and a bit on the oily side up front that subdues the carbonation a bit. The carbonation slowly intensifies toward the finish as the oily feel transitions to a light resinous feel. Dark caramel malt is the dominant flavor with a hint of chocolate and dark, ripe, fruit through the middle. Hop character starts slowly but builds from beginning to end, starting with floral flavors and ending with pine hop bitterness. Finishes semi-dry with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Lots of subtle complexity in aroma, flavor and feel.","IronLover","Jul 16, 2011"

I thought csbosox may have not washed my glass very well. Then I read the lable and picked up Scottish red ale and things started to make more sence. The beer was poured into a New Belguim Worthy glass. Dark red with some firey hues near the bottom. Carbonation rose from the bottom to ample beige head that lasted most of the experience. The nose was smokey with a touch of roast. The hops didn’t really come out to play until the beer had warmed quite a bit. The flavor was very rich with chocolate and roast along with some peaty smokey flavor. A touch of toffee. Quite full bodied, and silky over smooth over the tongue. No unpleasant sensatiolns at all. Overall, this isn’t a beer I’d drink very often, but interesting nonetheless.","BlackWednesday","Jul 16, 2011"

Overall this is an average beer. I'm glad I had a chance to try it. Nugget Nectar turned me on to the style and think it may have me biased on my reviews of Amber Ales, but I'm trying to find another Amber Ale to live up to those standards.","brian44556","Jul 03, 2011"

Tons of citric hop flavor and smell ambushes me repeatedly. Sadly, I find that the malt is simply too weak to hold up to the aggressive hopping. Everything seems out of balance to me, both in the nose and in the taste. I've had imperial IPAs that had much better balance between malts and hops than this thing. I can't even smell or taste the malt, this comes across to me as a poorly done IPA, not as a red ale. I can't find any yeasty bready presence at all. I can't find any malt at all. I'm left alone with one trick pony citric hops. Thankfully, there is an excellent and light refreshing mouthfeel, crisply carbonated. The texture is easily the strongest suit of this brew. I'm not impressed.","WastingFreetime","Jun 23, 2011"

There was a nice amount of lace stuck to the glass. The Aroma was full of roasted caramel malt and had hits of pine cones. According to the bottle this beer was bottle conditioned which explains its very active carbonation. The taste comprised of chocolate, roasted malt and caramel. There is also a nice amount of bitter hop flavor and gives this ale some "balls". Overall very good beer, I was not disappointed.","GossageBrewery","Jun 21, 2011"

Nice resinous hops hit the tongue with some sweet but roasty malts. Ahh, kinda reminds me of some other hoppy, yet malty based beers I've been enjoying lately. If i didn't know better I would say there is some spicey rye in there but that could be the interplay of the hops fooling me. The beer has a nice smoothless, light carbonation from the natural fermentation. This is a quality beer throughout. This beer would pair well with a nice summer BBQ, or some sweet and spicey smoked wings.","Star80","May 27, 2011"

It's as sticky as it looks on the glass (and that's pretty sticky) in the mouth, and the carbonation doesn't burn too long or fade too fast. On top of all this I just noticed - is the C just backwards or is it "Red Roжet"? That would be neat. Lord knows we need more Soviet-themed red ales.

"4.3","+6.2%","4","4","4.5","4","4.5","Poured into dimple glass from a 12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown, almost black with frothy head and good lacing. Aroma is dominated by dark fruit, brown sugar, and an overall theme of sweet malt. Some grapefruity hops poke through as well, but only mildly. Flavor is loaded with silky smooth, and somewhat roasty malt with some sweetness. Hoppyness complements the sweetness of the malt. Palate is full and smooth. Full body, big carbonation, smooth finish. This was a fantastic huge malty beer with great balance!","CuriousMonk","Jan 14, 2011"

The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky finish. Overall, I'm not too big a fan o' this brew.

The body is dark and hazy, mostly mahogany with reddish edges. The aromas and taste are amazingly well balanced: a difficult feat considering how aggressively bold both its hops and malts are. On both the nose and the palate, sweet brown sugar is what I initially detect before a powerful citrusiness asserts itself. Layers of caramelly malts and pine resin battle it out on the palate. Orange zest and burnt sugar linger long on the finish. Very full-bodied, hefty as hell, and thoroughly gratifying.","droomyster","Aug 13, 2010"

Deep canidied fruits, brown sugar and grain on the nose. Taste is just a bit of sweet maltiness up front with loads of hops in the middle and on the back end. Definitely much drier and hoppier than an actual Scottish ale. Nice long finish. I remember having this beer for the first time years ago being new to craft beer and it kind of scared me away a little at the time. Just a little too much going on for me then.

Good first impression. This subtle, delightful start is quickly stormed by the deeper sweetness of vanilla frosting & dryer wholegrain muffins. A wide middle here, safe to say that this is a full flavored beer. Hops come rolling back to the battle in the throat. Although there's some age on this bottle (too much age, actually), I am hit by some rolling fresh grassy hopiness. this big earthy berth is all kept moving by a gorgeous helping of the large carbonation bubbling that prevents any filming or cloying. It all comes rolling to an end with a nice harmony of vanilla pudding and earthen hop that lingers on the back of the tongue. Well done from the crew in Healdsburg. Although it's a pretty burly beer, it still reads as clean and suitable even for the hottest of humid days here in Philly. Maybe I've docked a few points unfairly due to this bottle's age (very difficult to discern, plus it's been some time since my last tasting), but overall I am still a big fan. I'll definitely come back to sip on the Red Rocket again soon.","Philabeerphia","Jul 05, 2010"

Don't get me wrong, this is still a decent looking brew. The aroma is a home run, sweet grains and caramel are at the forefront, and hops of an earthy nature are chiming in quite loudly. Fruity with spice, and a spritz of citrus are how the hops make them selves known. A strong malt nose is there to sweeten the deal that allows the alcohol to go by with only the smallest evidence. The taste is what makes this a red ale even more than the color. A strong flavor of unfermented malts and caramel are coating the tongue. Make way for the bitterness to help balance the load. The hops play a key role in the balance of the taste. Not to bitter not too sweet. Hops and grain are playing nicely together. The body is also a nice characteristic in this amber. I really dig the way the carbonation feels in the mouth...light. For such a sweet ale I think the body remains thin.

Huge malty nose - some caramel/toffee notes, as well as chocolate malt and a hint of citrusy hops. Not at all what I expected; aromas are very consistent with an American Barleywine in my opinion. Taste follows nose - the barleywine quality definitely holds up in the mouth - maybe a little more rounded out, but this is supposed to be an American Amber after all. Flavors culminate in a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a lively carbonation. A very tasty brew, but flavors lack the crispness I've come to associate with the style.

The flavors for this brew are very nice, hops clearly come out to play and are prominent but there is a very nice malt flavor of caramel and roasted grains that really provides a balanced mix.

Rich nose of pine infused hops backed with hints of whole wheat bread crusts. Flavorful and bold brew, loaded with rich notes of sweat caramel and toasty malts quite nicely balanced by herbal, piney and biting hops. Rich and regal.

"4.07","+0.5%","4","4.5","4","3.5","4","Heard this one was a good amber, been meaning to try it for a long time. Poured a very dark red, darker than I would have imagined with a one and a half finger head that leaves heavy lacing down the side of my glass. Smells of a lot of hops balanced with some good malt sweetness, it definitely has the aggressive Scotch (malty) character they talk about on the bottle with some alcohol in the nose. Taste is very well characterized by the strong nose. Hops and malts are balanced up front and lead you to that strong scotch taste that is hard to describe. Some alcohol kicks in later in the beer, but is not overwhelming. Hop character is pretty big in the initial and after tastes. I kind of like the scotch (malty) taste in this beer also, its not too strong but gets the job done, adds an interesting element. The taste seems to stay true for the whole bottle. Mouthfeel is a bit more light/watery than I would like it, good carbonation and a decent amount of warmth from the alcohol. Leaves a hop coating on the tongue that compliments the alcohol and malts well. Would like it a bit less watery and thicker. Drinkability is good, tastes good, not a bad price from BR, alcohol and hops seem like they would take this one over after a few, probably will buy this one again if I wanna try and session it.","cbutova","Oct 15, 2009"

Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and goes down easy.

Not like the thick, foamy, sticky rings of an IPA. Very nice lacing. The smell was good, hops are there and so is the malt but nothing that made me say, "can't wait to try this beer." That thought entered my head after upon gazing at the finished pour. Pale malt and red cream soda in the smell and taste. A little honey to back it up. Not getting any caramel as other reviewers noted. Very malty like sweet red candy, half cinnamon, half cherry. Mouthfeel is thick, carbonation perfect, silky and creamy.

The hops scent was also fairly present, but not as strong as previous reviews I've read indicate. The taste also lacked the strong hops I was hoping for. I saw no freshness date on the bottle, so it may be that my bottle was not exactly fresh. The store I purchased from has some good beers, but is more tuned for macros and cheap wine. Taste was pretty balanced, but tilted more toward the malts. Has a somewhat creamy smoothness to it. This was decent, but I was hoping for more. I'll have to revisit with a bottle in which I'm sure of the freshness to see if that is an issue, or if my palate just doesn't appreciate this beer.","alkemy","Sep 30, 2009"

As soon as I got home I poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This brew poured a very dark brownish color with a thick tan head. Hold it up to the light and the glass reflects a brilliant dark red color. This beer has a very malty scent with hints of piney hops. The taste is similar to an IPA but much more dark and with a much drier finish. The beer finishes with a dry, grapefruit bitter taste. This is not my favorite Bear Republic brew, but is definitely worthy of a try. I will buy this again, however it not on the top of my list. As far as drinkability, don't bank on having this as a session beer. My session beer preference has to include somewhat of a refreshing aftertaste and this doesn't exactly fit that criteria. This would be great with dinner, especially with red meat; perhaps a fat steak. Since it's 6.8% ABV, a couple with dinner would be perfect.","Brewnami","Apr 23, 2009"

In the nose the malt scents of cocoa and brown sugar have trouble finding their footing, just about the same for the raisin, cherry, apricot fruit, the big blast of bitter hops, white pepper, straw, cut grass and tea leaves, doesn't integrate into a whole. Medium-bodied, similar experience in the mouth with kind of flat-footed carbonation not helping organize the gang in one direction. The hoppy bite creates rye, raw grains, pine cone, grapefruit and orange citrus flavors while likely at the same time contributing to its arch dryness and diminishing the enjoyment of the former. Caramel, cocoa and brown sugar can't sweeten things up much. At times it seems ego-driven, showing off for no real reason.

My favorite beer style is Altbier, so it's not that I can't appreciate a good, bracingly bitter beer. It's just that a good, bracingly bitter beer needs something else to balance it out, and I'm not finding it here. I have a feeling I'd love Double Red Rocket, but as it is this beer simply seems unfinished.","Windigstadt","Jan 30, 2009"

Red Rocket was definitely a hoppier beer than I expected but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it as much as I did...being that I'm not a huge hophead. The beer had a nice crispness with a decent amount of carbonation. It is a beer that definitely can knock you on your butt if you don't pay attention to it's smooth 6.80% abv.

Aromas show, as does the flavors a great balance with crisp hoppy citrus, spice and floral notes from the hops also filling the nose. Mouthfeel is full, round and smooth with a bit of oiliness. Flavors start sweet much like the aromas with caramel malt, toffee and brown sugar quickly followed up with a firm but moderate hop bitterness with citrus and pine coming through.

It finishes sweet and the sweet battles the bitter and wins out. The mouthfeel is nice, a smooth beer with a medium body that has a nice flavor balance. The sweet isn't overpowering, and the higher ABV isn't noticeable. This one is an easy drinker, could see it getting annoying after a few, but the flavor is distinct and delicious.

I also pick up a touch of coffee, unexpected. Nice malt body with good carbonation, good balance between the sweet and bitter. This is a very good amber ale.

Upon first taste, the bold hop profile was the first thing that I noticed, with buttery and caramel malt flavors in the background, and a slight warming alcohol presence at the finish. This one is a bit heavy and sticky on the palate, but finishes easier then one might think. Not something you'd want to pound a 6'er of in one sitting, but a damn fine brew in it's own right.

Aroma is of sweet hops balanced with a nutty malt flavor. There's a very strong "deep" nutty malt aroma here that I'd expect from a Belgian or a complex sweet stout, which I really enjoy. Taste predominantly comes from the bittering hops- at first a bit overwhelming (I'm not a hophead..) but it goes well with the light rum and bready tones of the malt. Also a very strong hop aftertaste, both from the bittering and flavoring hops, with a slight dried prune taste. I'd say that the mouthfeel is dead on- smooth up front and in the back with a nice peak in acidity from the carbonation and hops in the middle. I'd say this might be a little more drinkable on draft and it gets more malty and bready as it gets warmer. Overall very nice.","wiseguy142","Sep 18, 2008"

"4.08","+0.7%","4.5","4","4","4.5","4","Its a very nice dark copper body with lots of red hues. The head is a large dirty tan rocky lace monster that does a great job leaving loads of art work on the glass. Smell is piney and citrus hops in a carmal malt bomb. Also get some light floral and grassy notes. The taste is a good bitter hop hit up front riding a very forward carmal/toasted malt flavor with some nice pine and rind flavors coming through. This one is more full bodied than medium and realy has a luxurious feel to its slightly chuncky body. Its a big beer but drinkable, however 22oz in one sitting is plenty for me at least. Overall another very very good beer from Bear Republic.","jordoo","Aug 27, 2008"

Plenty of sweet, roasty malt in the taste, juxtaposed by quite a bit of resinous hop bitterness. The sweet/bitter thing works better here than in many other west coast brews, but they still don't really 'balance' each other as intended--it's just quite sweet and quite bitter at the same time. Very slight warming alcohol. Medium body with good carbonation. Not a bad beer, though it's not exactly refined.","philipquarles","Aug 21, 2008"

First of all this may be the best looking beer I've ever seen. The color is a rich, dark hazy amber. Thick, rocky mocha colored head that settles into this amazing creamy head with great retention and awesome lacing. After it settles it practically looks like its been on nitro-tap I swear. Smell is rich of malt, caramel, and hops. Taste is great. A nice strong malty backbone but not to be outdone by the hops. Nice, bitter west coast hops. In a way it almost reminds me of an English IPA (like Drake's IPA) but thats a good thing. Mouthfeel is perfect. It is light and easy drinking yet there is a creamy texture to it that feels so smooth going down. Overall a great beer.

Aromas off this beer are dominated by hops, lots of piney Chinook and citrusy Cascades. Following are notes of caramel, toasted bread, and some diacetyl. On the palate, this is a substantial amber with lots of hop flavor (not exceptionally fresh), malt depth and plenty of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is medium, body medium high. Alcohol is quite noticeable, almost a bit hot as it's a very dry beer. Overall, it's a solid beer, but it leaves me wanting in the malt department.","dreadnatty08","Jul 02, 2008"

"4.28","+5.7%","4.5","4","4.5","4.5","4","One of the few Amber Ales done right. The approach is that of a serious IPA, but with the malt profile found in Irish Reds. It turns out beautiful. A dark mohogany look with a shy, creamy, tan head formation, retention, and lacing. Aromas are a blend of sorgum / barley with a sharp blend of pine, citrus, and herbs. Very clean from the apprearance, through the flavors and aromas, and on into the textures. Bready as if done via decoction mash, but softly sweetened by barley, syrups, and candied fruits. Equally soft in the texture. Though not a Cask Ale, the beer exhibits the constant soft carbonation and creamy mouthfeel better than most from the bottle. A light mint joins the frey in the finish, along with a long, lingering pine / confectionate blend. Very nice Amber Pale, even if a little bite-ey in the end.","BEERchitect","May 21, 2008"

A big malt odor lurks behind the floral hoppiness with a slight metallic tinge the only negative. Oily hoppiness rolls onto the tongue with an orange peel flavor and medium bitterness. The thin malt flavor is overwhelmed by the hops but still detectable during the middle of a mouthful. But when the brew heads for the back of the mouth, a moderate astringency and stronger hop bitterness quickly drown out the malt. The metallic note in the nose becomes apparent to the palate on the aftertaste. I really didn't much care for this one.","charlzm","Feb 29, 2008"

Mouthfeel was lightly carbonated and incredibly smooth going down. Alcohol is well hidden but pokes out ever so slightly. Nice lacing on the glass too, after the girlfriend and I downed the bomber.

The nose is the sweetest citrusy oranges blended with sweet, toasted, caramel malts. These carry straight through to the taste where an INCREDIBLE balance of sweet citrus and caramel, light toasted biscuits, and earthy-pine hop bitterness spark the taste buds. Mouthfeel is medium with just a touch of alcohol heaviness pulling it towards full. Big billowing carbonation keeps Red Rocket creamy and fresh. Dare I say out of this world? Okay, enough already.

A sweet malt yet hoppy and fruity aroma permeated from the glass. Taste was just as good but richer. Thick hoppy notes hit the tongue first with a bit of citrus fruit.

The head holds up well and this beer leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. The taste is really great. Bitter hops up front, followed by a caramel tasting malt flavor. Finishes with suggestions of both hops and malts. Mouthfeel is very good.The hops are strong, piney, resinous up front, but civilized enough for the full strength and just-right sweetness of the malts. This is a thick, rich, luxurious mothfeel.

On the palate, Red Rocket starts off smooth and sweet, but following a wall of carbonation things get nutty and bitter, with some pronounced tea-leaf flavors. Things taper off toward the finish, with one more blip of juicy hop bitterness, and then the beer kind of lingers on the palate for a while. Overall, this is an interesting beer.

There are some fruity esters that are much in line with the Bear Republic house yeast character. Hops bring a lot of grapefruit and a touch of aspirin in the finish.

The smell was almost all grapefruit and pine resin with a tiny bit of sweet malt hiding in the back. The taste, too, was nearly all big hops. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style, I thought. Overall, it isn't a bad beer, it just strays way outside of what this style should be. This is like handing someone a beer blindfolded and telling them you gave them a pint of smoked porter and really there's gueuze in the glass. That guy is about to be in for a shock, eh?

Taste is more of the same caramel, with some dark fruit as well. There is a nice slightly roasty flavor with hints of chocolate malt. The finish is dry, and there is no hint of a alcohol. This beer has held up very well and I wouldn't hesitate to age it for a year or so.","ericj551","Jul 18, 2007"

Smells of tropical hops at first, with Simcoe-esque passionfruit, mango, and grapefruit, along with woody (cedar?), piney, perhaps floral notes and a caramelly, almost smoky malt backing. The taste follows through almost exactly, with smooth carbonation (due to conditioning) on top of a medium body that provides coating, lingering hop oils.

The beer holds a thick head which lasts several minutes after pouring. The smells are slightly sweet with hop covering the aroma. Hops continue upon tasting the beer, stronger than most Scottish ales, but then again aggressive hops were the brewmasters goal. The malts are neither lacking nor overbearing and compliment the overall feel of the beer. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with only the slightest linger of flavor that makes you crave more.

The smell is an overpowering malty sweetness with a distinct hop aroma that I can't place for the life of me. Taste is just odd, it's not at all displeasing, but this beer is so sweet, so over the top with malt sugars and malt roastiness. The hop bitterness is greatly subdued by the sugary sweetness of the heavey malt - definitely a red ale, no doubts there in the flavor, just BIG. I usually find big red's like this (Saint Rogue, Santa's Private, CascaZilla) to be more approachable and this beer is definitely something that requires thought before drinking a bomber of. I had never tried it before, so I didn't know what to expect and what I got was a big malty red super sweet, slightly bitter red. I'm kind of tempted to suggest that if the bitterness were more pronounced that this beer would be much more balanced and more enjoyable. I mean it's certainly not a bad beer, and if I were to see it on tap somewhere I might grab a pint, but I think this will not grace my fridge again any time soon, I just can't imagine being in the mood for this when I'm at home relaxing.","miskatonic","Dec 16, 2006"

The taste is well malted and well hopped; the balance of both are properly combined to elicit a moderately full bodied mouthfeel; a tad sticky and well rounded. The flavors last several minutes in the mouth. The alcohol is well disguised beneath the generous weight and flavors of this fine brew, which remind me of a "mini" Alpha King, with both beers having similar flavors and characteristics.

This is followed closely by citrus and a hint of pine that's strongest at the mid-point. Toffee kicks in at the end. The hop bitterness comes forward in the finish, which is balanced very nicely. Creamy texture aided by superb carbonation, this is a silky smooth beer with a dry finish. There's also just a bit of alcohol warmth that creeps in after a while, but it's very subdued.

Slightly smoother than the draft or bottled version, but then that's the signature of real cask ale. Full bodied yet totally drinkable, perfect for the rainy day I had it on.

The viscosity of the beer seems slightly higher than is typical for this style, making it engaging. Aromas of hard candy and grass dominate. There are other scents, but they are difficult to place. The combination of aromas is not very appealing, hence the lower score. The taste is as would be expected for this style; a well balanced hop profile with a malt backbone that seems to linger. The alcohol is well masked and does not hinder the texture or the blending of flavors in this beer.

I must say even though I knew it was going to be hoppy, the hop scent still blew me away after the deep red pour. It is a very deep amber-orange unless held against direct yellow light where it turns a marvolous red. It had a thick tan head which complemented the carbonation bubbles slowly running up the side. The red color is enduced by a vienne malt. It produces a pleasurable but fleeting sweet as the hops are the primary flavor in this brew. Heavily hopped. I could taste the typical cascades of the west coast, however I wasn't expecting the heavy kick it gave. It was a welcome suprise given that I am a huge hop fan. I did not sense any sour notes on the side of the tongue which is a huge plus. The bitterness tones out the sweetness a little too much. I normally would like that, but it is a kick in the face seeing that the color is more reminiscent of an irish red with little hop character. I found the mouthfeel very pleasant and give it a thumbs up because it does work the majority of the tongue, except the sour outside of course. This beer is a true joy for hop-lovers. If you are expecting a Scotch Ale (as they were originally aiming for- but then made it a hybrid later) steer clear, this one has way too much hops to even be associated with that style. A true joy for hops lovers.","poluti","Oct 27, 2005"

Taste is slightly less appealing than the aroma, but that's not saying anything tremendously deprecating because the aroma was, as I said, tremendous.

The taste is nicely hopped right at the start and the carmel malt shows midway through. The bittering hops slap you in the face after the sweetness resides. I love a hop bite, but this may have been a little too much for this beer. It seems a bit unbalanced. Those who fear hops and love typical ambers will be easily turned away from this one.

One of the better amber red's out there. This reminded me a little of Newport Storm's Maelstorm IPA. Hoppy but a big malt backbone. Good stuff.","necoadam","May 17, 2005"

Smell and taste are full of flavor and character. Nice piney hops up front but with a really strong backing of nutty malts. Sometimes I think these amber/red ales really are the epitomy of a well balanced beer. Has that Bear Republic signature hoppy kick but it's a little more mellow and subdued than say an IPA.

"3.95","-2.5%","4","4","4","3.5","4","Fairly dark red in hue, if not brown in spots, around the edges there are some ruby highlights (no lit backdrop is needed). The head was beige in color; at the maximum it reached about one finger in height. Then I quickly faded to a chucky, soapy cap, lacing was spotty and unorganized. The nose is powerfully hoppy, very assertive. There is a great jolt of pine and citrus (grapefruit flesh and rinds). Even though the malt doesnt really penetrate the hops I get the vibe there will be a good malt backbone. Maybe the color is playing tricks on me. There are obvious ripe fruity aromas. This adds some needed depth. Im very intrigued by the smells, thus it is inviting. Excellent potency. The palate is very charming. The malt isnt quite as big as I was expecting but it does play a very important role and it does it well. The label says Scottish Red, I can see that in the malt as it shows flashes of depth, rich and sweet with a bit of toasty caramel. Dont get me wrong the malt isnt very aggressive but it does provide support. The hops are the go-getters and this is why the label states Bastardized before it says Scottish Red. On the palate the hops are aggressive, the bitterness is solid but not devastating. They start off piney and remain so for a long while and then briefly they turn citrusy. There seems to be a disconnect between the malt and hops. They dont fit each other nor do they work in harmony (there is no conflict either). If they did this would be a great beer. As is, it is tasty and very good. The aftertaste is candied malt and piney hops. Nice. Medium in body, too thin for this beer, it is a little watery but not flawed. It is plenty drinkable and just as likeable. This is another dandy from Bear Republic, to bad the only place I see them is in Wisconsin. I bought this bomber in Milwaukee. Worth a try.","bditty187","Sep 21, 2004"

Despite tons of hops, I can detect beefy malt flavors of caramel and roasted malts with hints of chocolate. Not a light beer by any strech of imagination and needs to be handled with some respect. My wife commented that it tasted almost like a light version of Three Floyds Dreadnaught. I thought it reminded me of Panama Red Ale from the Flossmoor Station brewpub south suburbs of Chicago.

Smell was of pungent hops, sliding into a peaty smokiness and a slight bready note, probably from bottle conditioning. Taste was a whole lot of grapefruit hops delicately balanced with a slight, sticky sweetness and caramel, which comprised the strong malty backbone. There was more of the smokey flavor that rounded the taste out nicely. Mouthfeel was crisp and full of hops yet generally smooth and easy drinking. It is always nice to find red ales that have a little bit of oomph and a unique flavor.","GreatPondBrewer","Jan 21, 2004"

Aroma is pleasant of a nice leafy hop bringing a smooth woody earthy dryness over the top of some dulled fruityness and toasted, nearly burnt malts. Taste has a very nice balance of toasted malts and grassy/woody dry hops, starts smooth and lightly sweet of malts as it turns toasted with a substantial building over the palate of the toastyness with the wood dryness sneaking in just past midway and making a home through to the finish where it mixes nicely with notes of dulled dried fruit of apricot, peach, and raisin, and finishes with an overall super nice earthy dryness and texture. Feel detains a smoother start then raises to a thick fullness from there and follows into the drying finish, a slim toastyness lingers. This is a very good amber, one of the better ones I've had with a nice dry hop profile that was hardly bitter in any form, just some tiny glimmers of bite that made this very nice with a certain complexity that was favorable to my palate. Good stuff - thanks goes to Drewbage1847 for the bomber.","tavernjef","Dec 09, 2003"

Sweet malt, a hint of pears and a touch of warming alcohol add to the overall excellence of the aroma. Toasty malt, light toffee, hint of chocolate and light sweetness is revealed in graduating degrees as it warms. Sharp grapefruit, orange peel, lemon grass and hint of metallic bite make up a wonderful and lively hoppy flavor.

The smell was a good hoppy and malty aroma with notes of oak and caramel. The taste was dominated by the hops which gave an astringency to the beer, but flavors of caramel, floral hops, and even a slight sweetness were also present. The mouthfeel was very dry with medium body and carbonation. The dry astringency was balanced somewhat by a slight sweet and tangy feel on the tongue. This was a very nice and very hoppy brew. Very enjoyable.","UncleJimbo","Sep 28, 2003"

Aroma: Beautifully balanced with spurts of hops exploding in the air piney and floral just oh so good, hints of some peated malt a very mild smokiness toasted nuts are just some of the tones I am picking up from malt profile. Taste: Not nearly as hoppy as the aroma wonderful balance but distinct in your face flavors making a wonderfully melded brew from Healdsburg, CA. Piney hops with a perfect balance of mildly sweet toasted and slightly musty yeast tones awesome flavor here so good and balanced making this another 22oz that goes down way to effortlessly. Mouthfeel: Fuller medium bodied beer with a perfect carbonation level for imbibing and enjoying, this beer is succulent and I could just picture pairing it with a medium cooked filet mignon. The flavors seem to be able to coexist in perfect harmony. Drinkability: As I said earlier in the review effortless, but it's much more than that when you edge with each sip toward an empty glass you start to lessen the size of your sips and yearn for another bottle to appear that's what should happen with every great drinkable beer this one hold's true all so well.","WVbeergeek","Sep 25, 2003"

It's full of so much - toffee and malt and honey and sweet pear, hits the back of the tongue with butterscotch, and stings the back of the throat with alcohol. Very warm and rich and ever changing flavor. This is very complex and makes you want more to keep looking for more nuances. Pretty drinkable for a big beer.","far333","Sep 24, 2003"

It pours a dark reddish brown with a light tan head that leaves nice lace rings throughout consumption. The nose is quite complex; fruity, light english toffee (which personally I distinguish from caramel when it seems just slightly buttery) and citrus...all nicely integrated, nothing dominates. The aromas don't quite translate to the tastebuds. PNW hops are evident along with some caramel and just enough bitter roasted barley. I don't get the smokiness that others have mentioned. The mouthfeel seems to be on the thin side for a 6.8% abv beer. All in all, a very tasty brew.","johnrobe","Jun 26, 2003"

In fact, I was really impessed by the thickness of the lacing and the beautiful almost mountain-like head. Tasted real nice with a great balance of hops (just enough to provide some fragrance and bitterness) and malt which was of a toasty smoky Stout like roast.

How to put this in a category? First, some malt, then a smoky, smoky burn. The malt tries but is overcome by hops and charcoal. Bitter aftertaste. Starts sweet, but just cannot end there. On the bottle, BR says, "this unfiltered, bottle-conditioned, amber-colored ale breaks all style molds." True. I do not know what to call this thing. It is like a scotch ale, but it also has Belgian spiciness, a Marzen snap, and a stout-like sourness. Who cares what category it lands in? They admit that it does not fit, and that is resplendent honesty. This is a fun beer. I will keep one in the back of my fridge.","Darkale","Mar 23, 2003"

"4.35","+7.4%","4","4","4.5","4.5","4.5","Carefully poured it's fairly clear with just a few specks of yeast sediment. I personally prefer it with the yeast - and give it a swirl - but it still remains just hazy (not cloudy). The body is a very deep copper and it's topped by a frothy ivory head that holds exceptionally well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma offers some sweet, lightly smoky and caramel-tinged malt as well as some grassy and spicy hops (although it doesn't really become apparent until it warms). The full body is accentuated by a natural carbonation from bottle conditioning - restrained (@ 2.2 vol CO2) with very tiny bubbles - and it's quite creamy and smooth across the palate. Very nice! The rich grassy hops are the first thing that's noticed in the flavor, followed by some soft sweet malt and a touch of smokiness as it crosses the palate before finishing with a rousingly dry and bitter finish. Long lingering hop flavors and some residual smokiness keep it interesting and remind you that you have a beer in front of you! Very well done and quite enjoyable. Also very unique as well. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Jan 02, 2003"
"4.57","+12.8%","4","4.5","4.5","4.5","5","Citric hop aroma hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Pours medium-brown in color, well-carbonated, with a half-finger head. Aroma remains quite hoppy as the beer sits, though caramel-like malt notes eventually begin to shine through. Big cascade hop flavor up front. So big, in fact, that I begin to wonder about the appropriateness of calling this a Scotch Ale. Good grainy malt body with some real depth -- caramel sweetness and some very light toasted notes. You need to enjoy it quick, though, because the hops don't let themselves be overpowered for long. Finish is very bitter and remains present in the aftertaste which is citric and fruity. Great beer -- reminds me more of a notched-up Sam Adams lager than a Scotch Ale, but if you're looking for a good bitter amber, this is a good way to go.","mzwolinski","Dec 24, 2002"
