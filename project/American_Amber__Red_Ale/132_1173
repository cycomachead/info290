Maybe it's a year old? Maybe it went bad. I expected better from Rogue. And from Santa.","Trombone69","Mar 16, 2015"

This holiday ale pours a bright ruby red with a tenacious off white head that lingers long till dissipating to a thin layer and thick ring of foam with moderate lacing.  Nose of spicy hops, sweet raisins and caramel, and an underlying earthy tone.  Flavors follow the nose with a rich caramel and juicy hop notes that vies for dominance.  Sweet raisins are noted in the background but are overtaken by the bittering hops.  Light carbonation to moderate carbonation and a smooth mouth feel finishes wet and bitter.  Remember past years being a bit sweeter, but then again only have this once a year.  Reminiscent of a red Mogul ale which is  an awesome brew.  Improves a lot with warmth.  Nice.","Brutaltruth","Feb 27, 2015"

Pours a wonderful copper color with 2 finger long lasting off white head.  Scent of pine bark and hops. Very hoppy taste and a slight hint of cinnamon. reminds me more of an IPA than an amber. Overall a beer I would recommend for the hopheads out there.","Burgz","Feb 11, 2015"
