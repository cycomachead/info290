"3.9","-3.9%","4","4","4","4","3.5","Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/4/2014. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange zest, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of citrus/tropical hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice red ale. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 19, 2015"

This is followed by a blend of caramel, a little buckwheat honey and burnt sugar before a long and brilliantly bitter finish dominated by the most gorgeously oily and resiny feel. This is by no means the oiliest beer there ever was, nor does it come close, but instead exudes great depth. This is further enhanced by a soft and supple carbonation. Fantastic stuff, Maine Beer has always impressed with the mouthfeel on their beers but this one is remarkable. Recommended for fans of Nugget Nectar.","DefenCorps","Dec 05, 2014"

Aroma starts with a floral citrus nose, slowly the tangy notes of grapefruit find there way thru followed by a sweet caramel flavor, some orange comes in as well on the back end. A medium to full body smooth on the palate, good carbonation and a sticky mouth feel. The finish is a combination of sweet caramel malt tones, citrus, orange and a tangy grapefruit hops bitterness flavor are left lingering on the palate and taste buds.

"4.02","-1%","4.25","4","4","4","4","Thanks, jlindros. Pours a nice bright, reddish, copper-ish amber color. It seems to be fairly hazy, though it is a bit hard to tell. The head is cream colored and puffs up quite nicely. Easy to swirl back up, as well. Lots of little bubbles. Good lacing and retention. Lots of hops in the aroma. I’m getting earthy and fruity flavors: berries, citrus, grass, pine, spice. The hops dominate, but there’s a solid malt character underneath. Toasty caramel and brown sugar. Mild bready sweetness. Good dose of nutty flavor. Mild vanilla. The taste is dry, particularly for the style, and medium bitter. Dried out crystal malt caramel backbone with that spicy, earthy, fruity hoppiness on top. Starts off with honey and caramel before the grapefruit rind and pine resin bitterness takes over, bringing with it all of the more delicate hop notes, as well. Lots of hop flavor in finish, which hits with a nice shot of bitterness and lingering fruit. Prickly carbonation. Seems a touch higher than most Ambers. Light feel for a 7% abv beer, not really surprising since it’s rather dry. I don’t love the style, but this is an excellent example and a very well made beer. It’s dry and bitter with good flavor. Easy to drink. Seems like it would go great with pizza.","popery","Jul 26, 2014"

Although I prefer a greater hop presence in a red ale, this beer is perfect for what it is intended to be. For that reason, taste gets a five. Bravo MBC for achieving such a scrumptious beer that showcases the hop and malt profile in such a fresh and crisp manner. This is my first time trying anything from Maine Beer Company, and I look very forward to trying others if this beer is any reflection of the quality coming from this brewery.","antott0523","May 08, 2014"

Filmy amber red in color with a healthy glow, you have to get really close to see the active bubbles within, overall the color may be closer to brown than orange, on the dark side. The nose mixes cocoa. floral water, orange peels, baking spice and a stiffening amount of bright hops and hard crust baguette, while there’s little that is bitter it never feels too sweet, the peach, apricot, red cherry, pear fruit scents are much more complementary than the star of the show. Medium-bodied, creamy mouth feel with close to zero softness, has an understated muscularity. Not a lot of roast, dryness comes from the grassiness, dark chocolate powder, bread grains and bare touch of black pepper. Caramel, spiced oranges, chamomile, basil and oregano, the breadiness is not sweet but is a steadying cornerstone. Peach, apricot, nectarine fruit with a touch of pineapple. It has a slimmed down fluidity which you don’t find often these days in this beer category. Goes on and on at the end, entirely unforced.","farrago","Apr 06, 2014"

Leaves some lacing behind but not a lot and in clumps. The smell has a strong hop presence with an even stronger roasted and caramel malt nose. The caramel malts seem to dominate the smell and the hops compliment it rather than dominate. The taste is different from the smell. While the caramel and roast malt notes are still there, the hops tend to dominate the pallate. The mouthfeel is smooth and bubbly with a slightly dry finish. Overall, a fantastic beer and worth getting.","HattedClassic","Jan 24, 2014"

Pours a medium to dark red amber with a fine light two-finger, walnut colored head that kept growing for quite a while after pouring. Looks like a sundae. Aroma of piney and citrus hops, light malt. Flavor is dense, biscuit malt, resiny pine and citrus hops, grapefruit rind, hints of lots of odd flavors, like holiday spicing and chocolate. Finishes with a pleasant citrus hop and fruit bitterness. Medium bodied with good creaminess, nice mouth feel. This is a beer that seems to have a lot going on, but the flavors are so well integrated that it is difficult to identify them. Very pleasing and balanced. Great dry malt and nice hops. Excellent.

In body, the beer is clear and clean, but with a pronounced haze, perhaps from the heavy use of hops in the beer. On the nose, the beer smells richly of citrus grapefruit and prickly pine. The caramel malt is also nicely present, giving the nose caramel bread notes. Sweet citrus pith is dominant on the nose, however, and provides a nice aroma. The yeast character is clean and faint on the nose, and as the beer warms you do get a touch of hot alcohol on the nose, unfortunately. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter and softly roasty, with a nice bready sweetness balancing out the sip. Mild citric acidity plays into the finish, where the beer dries out and gives the tongue a nice bitter click. In flavor, the beer begins as caramel roast, almost like a light ice coffee with toffee syrup. Citrus quickly swims onto the tongue, providing strong grapefruit flavors. The finish is like grapefruit juice with a touch of medicinal bitters and caramel bread, and the aftertaste is citric bitters and sweet toffee and bread. As the beer warms, the rich malt does appear more pronounced in the aftertaste, giving off warm oat bread flavors with a touch of caramel and toffee. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, almost light, but with a creamy carbonation and crisp mouthfeel that provide for a very interesting sip. There is a slight, resiny stickiness left in the mouth after the swallow. Overall, this is a more hop-forward amber ale, but it gives beautiful malt character as well. As the beer warms, more and more of the caramel bread can be sensed in the beer. The balance ends slightly on the bitter side, which will appease any hop heads, but the malt balance is also delicious. This beer is another success from the MBC, and honestly might give Zoe a run for her money. A side by side test will need to be administered.","Maxwell","Nov 25, 2013"

Sticky with resinous hop oils, subtle spiciness, grassy pine and earthy, soil-like flavor. Good hop flavor but not as complex as the nose suggests. A bit one dimensional and lacking the citrus/tropical fruit sweetness found in the aroma. Fortunately, there is plenty of flavorful malt sweetness filling this need and balancing things out nicely. Strong caramel malt presence with hints of toffee, biscuit, toast and subtle dark fruit sweetness. Really well balanced and easy to drink with no heat whatsoever. The malt backbone perfectly counters the dry bitterness of the earthy, floral hops. Similar to Zoe but more flavorful and better balanced in my opinion.

MBC's Zoe is a fine beer, too, and by memory I couldn't figure out the difference, so I put them side by side. The Zoe was from 10/8/13 and the RW was 10/22/13. The nose upfront was softer and more floral on the RW, while the Zoe was richer and deeper with gobs of pine. Mouthfeel and head were lush and fairly similar, but the carbonation on the RW felt lighter. The palate of RW was loaded with mango and citrus with malts that were light and sweet, kind of like vanilla and butterscotch. Swear it was like smelling the bark of a ponderosa pine out West. And Zoe was deeper in character with flavors more toward biscuit and toffee. Finish on both was smooth and lingering. Wouldn't kick either out of bed for eatin' crackers.

"4.09","+0.7%","4.5","4.25","4","4","4","Bitter resiny hops and a toasted grainy malt character, slightly medicinal hop character. Aftertaste is clean and toasty. Medium bodied and clean, moderate bitterness, vaguely sweet and bitter marmalade flavors. Dry and bitter aftertaste, lots of residual malt sweetness. In the vein of super fresh Alpha King on a good day.","emerge077","Nov 01, 2013"

While I'm not generally a big fan of red ales, this one is very good. So easy drinking, the only thing that stops this from being a regular of mine (which with its drinkability and flavor certainly could be) is it's availability and price point.","Resuin","Nov 01, 2013"

Maybe over the pond, but not here in America and certainly not compared to something like Lunch or Zoe. Time to go back to brewing good beer and not just being out to make money. Or at least make it less obvious the latter is your goal...","Brez07","Oct 30, 2013"
