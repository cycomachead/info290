My bottle was pretty fresh and had bite so I'm not sure how much has faded out, but I can imagine this being better super fresh. For now it's just ok.","RyanK252","Friday at 06:35 PM"

This is a nice, complex beer that I enjoyed and any aficionado of red's should as well.","Pourharddrinkslow","Mar 26, 2015"

I could hardly even taste the hops and malts anymore. More boozy than any barleywine, quad, or imperial stout I've had. No balance at all. This beer pretty much turned me off on anything Ballast Point.","sa93","Mar 24, 2015"
