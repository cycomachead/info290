Aroma has caramel malts and some vanilla, burnt sugar, pine, and pineapple. The caramel is the strongest part of the smell and reminds me a little of a barley wine. Taste is a nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops with a slight alcohol kick which is nice. I was expecting more of a pale ale, but this is a nice change of pace.","danh53","Mar 29, 2015"

Mouthfeel: Big, juicy, wet on the tongue with a lingering bitter. Overall: An excellent brew. I love the nice balance between the big hops and the Amber body. They play very well and it's evident that this beer has been fine tuned to let both shine. A very well crafted brew that is fun to find but not a pain the in ass to get. Will definitely be on the search for it next year and should not be looked over.","BergBeer","Mar 09, 2015"

The aromas was of soft hops and citrus and pine.  The taste was almost identical.  It was a beautiful combo of hops, citrus, pine and something sweet like honey.  It worked beautifully.  I like this beer because it was refreshing and tasted of liquid happiness!","JPowell712","Mar 07, 2015"

Perfectly clear, bright copper-orange liquid with a finger of orange tinged white head that settles to a thin layer of foam that stays around but doesn’t lay down any lacing.

The bitterness grows with each sip and features citrus, herbal, and pine hops. Medium body, resinous, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a dry finish from hops and alcohol.","SierraFlight","Mar 03, 2015"

Smells very nice when you really get a good whiff, but that's about it. Can't say how disappointed I was with this one. The first few sips left a sort of... gas-like, almost sulfur like after taste. Had to really force it down. I've had water problems before at my house, and our water tank had to be cleaned with chlorine to get the gasious sulfur like smell out of our water. The after taste of this beer reminded me of that smell. Terrible. I'm sure it is possible I simply got a bad batch but it really wasn't very good.

Poured from a 16oz can, crystal clear Amber body and a tightly frothed bone colored head about one inch thick. Lacing is reasonable, leaving surface lines with each sip. Smell is awesome citrus and evergreen goodness. Taste is a 50/50 balance of bitter hops and malty backbone. Feel is smooth and resiny.  Overall just an awesome beer. You could easily session or pound this ale, whichever method suits your fancy.","datalager","Feb 22, 2015"

While the malts remain in a supportive role, they develop a decent sweetness adding to juicy orange and tangerine. Grass and zingy lemon get introduced to the tastebuds by a lively carbonation, completing the sublime, surprisingly bitter hop character. Finishes with toffeeish malts, which get overpowered by a bitter, tropical hop onslaught in which pricky lime stands out among grass, pine and blood orange, leading to a long lasting bitterness. Drinks shockingly easy, while establishing a great depth in flavours with a beautiful smooth mouthfeel to it.","aleigator","Feb 19, 2015"

Sweet hoppy flavor: still very floral with oily citrus, berries, grapefruit, tangerines, and mangoes over some light grain.  Definitely a little too sticky sweet for me to want more than one.

It begins with a burst of tropical and grapefruit hop flavor that somewhat separates into the aroma flavors.  As these fade in the middle, a subtle caramel sweetness emerges that is quickly surpassed by a mild grapefruit rind bitterness.  As the bitterness subsides, a spicy character emerges over a light sweetness that is biscuit in character.  The finish is a slow fade of grapefruit rind, with a touch of tropical, over a biscuit/caramel sweetness.  The 7.5% alcohol is almost totally covered, appearing only in the lingering finish and a slight burn at the back of the throat.  Put simply, World Class.","tillmac62","Feb 05, 2015"

Caramel malt sweetness, citrus rind hops + light tropical fruit and resin.  Pretty big flavor, but I think this bottle may be not be the freshest...  Everything seems a bit subdued.  Great beer, though - glad I got to try it.","jpro","Aug 21, 2014"

Flavor is really good, with plenty of malt backed against high bitterness that tastes of citrus, fresh-mown grass hoppiness. Nice big body, but not overly heavy. Light esters finish out the dry end.","allengarvin","Jul 31, 2014"

Taste is more bitter than the nose, moderate to heavily bitter. The caramel sweetness and biscuits make a nice backbone to the pine, resin hoppy bitterness. Crisp mouthfeel. A solid effort for a hoppy IPA.","stoutman","Jul 27, 2014"

It is a dank beer, but does not have the herbal or onion flavors other such brews have. This beer comes with a lot of hype, which it mostly lives up to. Nice to see nugget hops get some love, though!","hail_seitan","Apr 24, 2014"
3.44,-20.6,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"I'll start by saying that I'm not really an IPA guy. Perhaps this is a controversial opinion, but I think that putting too many hops in a beer can totally ruin it by taking over all other flavors. That being said, I quite enjoy Nugget Nectar. When I first had it, the bitterness really struck me as I was not expecting this many hops in an amber or red ale. The rest of that bottle was nearly undrinkable but by the end of the second (which I drank along with food for what that's worth) I was very eager to go out and buy two more six packs. My only regret is that I didn't manage to get any more before the season for it stopped. I have two left now which I am holding onto like treasures for when I eat anything nicer than typical college student nonsense. Overall not my absolute favorite beer ever, but one which hugely grew on me from one of my favorite breweries.","MaddestHatter","Apr 24, 2014"

4.22,-2.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured straight down into a large tulip. Deep amber (15-16) with a two-finger head that settles down to a frothy one-finger heard after about two and a half minutes with solid lacing clinging to the sides. Nose is very sweet and floral with big notes of tropical fruit, pineapple, sweet orange, and more subdued floral hops. Compared to last year, I think this is a sweeter version, with far less pungent ganja hop aroma. Sip is sweet malt and fruit notes up front with a far greater hop presence expanding on the midpalate than the nose suggests. The hops bring a floral and resin-y funk to the party. The bitterness is somewhat tempered however, and while certainly a strong presence, the brew still hews closer to its sweeter amber ale roots. The back of the tongue however sees the bitterness become dominant, and the swallow and finish continue this trend, with subtle floral notes and light hints of grapefruit. As the beer warms a bit, the swallow is a bit more balanced, with more of the sweet malty notes, but the finish is still decidedly bitter. Despite the bitterness overtaking the whole affair and largely controlling the finish, there is never a feeling of oppressively drying tannins, which is actually something of an accomplishment and one of the reasons why, despite being a 7.3% abv beer with 93 ibus, this is a surprisingly easy drinking beer. Aiding to that ease of drinking is a soft, silky, smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation and moderate body. I would have liked to see more of the nice resin-y hop flavors of the midpalate continue a bit longer in the finish, but it’s a slight quibble for an overall terrific beer. Though I only have my notes from last year by which to judge, I think this year’s Nugget Nectar, or perhaps just my sixer, is a bit less hoppy and resin-y, so maybe they went lighter on the Tomahawk hops. Again, maybe it’s just my dim recollections, but I think I preferred the 2013 batch. That said, this is still fantastic stuff and it remains one of my favorite limited releases of the year.","8stringfan","Apr 09, 2014"

I thought the appearance was a reddish amber, clearly appropriate for the style. If I were to have smelled this beer without looking at it first, I would have sworn it was an imperial IPA. The upfront nose is all hops. On the sweet side. Best part of the beer in my opinion. On taste, it's certainly a well done amber. The initial hit to the palate is an IPA but it mellows in the end to malty amber, slightly fruity. The mouthfeel was the weakest part of this beer. It's a little milky. I left some lingering slipperiness on the tongue. Not super appealing. Overall it's nice take on an amber beer. Glad I tried it but it didn't convert me. Still not an amber fan.","SweetChicken","Apr 05, 2014"

Looks like HopBack (kidding)... deep, orange-amber hue with 2 1/2 fingers of slightly off-white head. Lots of lacing. Big pine, dank resinous goodness, and juicy citrus on the nose. I got a bigger dose of pine at first, which evolved to more grapefruit/lemony end of the spectrum as it warmed up. Seems to run the hop aroma gamut. Some transient grapefruit on the front of the palate, again, really prominent pine in the middle along with an excellent, balanced bitterness. More flavor than straight bittering presence. Balance is really the strong suit here. Crisp and clean with minimal aftertaste, mostly the pine lightly fading out. Took a classy, clean beer like HopBack and hopped the hell out of it. Makes sense. Get it fresh, of course. This was a solid A effort on my watch.","Mikus","Mar 30, 2014"

The hops are very forward and impart an amazing aroma and killer taste to this red ale. Fresh would be a word that describes the beer. Great crisp feel with a sharp hop bite. Malty, but not over the top. At 7.5% the alcohol sneaks up on you, but in no way is detected in the taste. It's a delicious brew! A late Winter tradition I look forward to yearly---highly recommended.","DJED69","Mar 13, 2014"

4.53,4.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"This isn't the most complex beer in the world, but it delivers on all accounts on exactly what a hoppy imperial amber is supposed to be - highly fruity and oily, with a underlying hop dankness, as well as a sweet caramel profile that melds with it and softens the initial astringency. This is so easy to drink, I could pound so many of these in one evening perhaps only to my detriment. Amber beers probably don't get any better than this, and I really wish we got six packs of this distributed in California. My favorite new amber, and one of my favorite new single hop beers for sure.","magictacosinus","Mar 13, 2014"

This is one of the better IPAs I've had. The nose is great and all, but the taste is the best part. Nugget Nectar promises and delivers some massive hops, but it has plenty of sweetness from malts with the tropical notes on the nose and palate. Really a delight to drink. It's got an incredible balance. It has that IPA bitterness, but the juiciness cuts through it almost just as quickly. Pine, tropical fruits, and definitely citrus come through a lot on this one. This is most definitely more of a midwest tasting IPA with its super enjoyable bittersweet combo. Truly excellent, and one of the best beers I've ever had.","Alextricity","Mar 08, 2014"

The nose is spectacularly hoppy with notes of pine and lots of citrus. Very very fresh smelling. The flavor follows suit and is super hoppy and fresh. Lots of bitter Grapefruit, mango and pine notes. There is a little underlying malt that balances this beer wonderfully but lets all the gorgeous hops shine through. This is an outstanding beer that I cant wait to enjoy more of.

Medium plus mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. Very much has a resinous imperial IPA feel to it which I was not expected. Really nice hoppy red ale that can be a real go-to. Nice beer, but not as mind blowing as expected.

It wasn't as hoppy as I expected it to be, (which is good), did have a very citrusy taste (not so good), but it would be something I would consider drinking if it was around.

With most breweries seeking to be the king of the IPA realm, Troegs knocks it out of the park with something thats slightly off the beaten path. Drinks with the bite of an IPA, but has other qualities that make this beer stand out amongst the rest. Props Troegs!","Omnium","Jan 24, 2014"

Beautiful amber color, with very thick white head which dissipated slowly, leaving nice even lacing all the way through the experience. Incredibly powerful nose, with unique scent of orange peel and pine dominating on the front end. On the palate, soft citrus fruit sets the pace, and the bite of the hops is subtle yet clear/crisp. The alcohol is virtually undetectable, which is understandable in this relatively low OG amber. Tremendous mouthfeel -- soft and chewy. Overall, this one lives up to the hype IMHO. A very nice, crisp, smooth, and imminently quaffable pour. I look forward to drinking many more.","JohnParadee","Jan 22, 2014"

The scent was a dark rich sweet malt with piny citrus overtones. The taste starts slightly bitter then the sweet malt begins to take over and provide a decent finish. Toward the end one will pick up the higher abv. The mouthfeel was full body with decent carbonation. Overall a good beer....sessioning might be difficult but it might be worth a try.","WoodBrew","Sep 10, 2013"

Aroma is pine sap, bright herbs, cut grass and fresh morning dew. Maybe a hint of citrus, but big grassy pine woods in your face. Moderately full mouthfeel with spicy hops over a backdrop of malt. The hops takes center stage though and the astringent bitterness is IPA-esque despite this being an "amber ale."

4.25,-1.8,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"This beer poured a beautiful burnt orange with perfect clarity and dancing champagne bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. It yielded an ample head of billowy foam that receded lazily to a sturdy cap and some sticky, clinging lace. Nose is fresh, floral and orange with a malt character that smells more like a lager. The malt is full and round on the nose, toasty then giving way to a toffee sweetness. Taste is piney, resin, bitter and delightful with breaddy malt. The malty sweetness keeps increasing on the palate and the strong malt base is inexhaustible next to the thundering hops. Finishes dry, slick, crisp and both the hops bitter and the malt sweetness dance on the tongue long after the swallow. This beer takes you to the edge of it’s mammoth malt profile and then lets all the endless hops leap to their happy go lucky limit. Nugget Nectar is a jubilee of taste sensation. Wonderful!","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The flavor just explodes in amber perfection. At 7.5%, it has enough malt to give perfect balance to the really fresh hop flavor. The flavors swish around, blend marvelously, and don't leave an overly-sticky aftertaste. It is crisp, clean, and screams out "this is what the perfect amber should be."","yankeepride","May 09, 2013"

A nice play off of one of their flagship beers. The hop back puts this beer over the top. It pours a nice orangish color and lacing head. The best part is it tastes like it smells, fruity, hoppy and citrusy. Hops and malt are very well balanced for this beer. Coming in at 7.5 ABV. it drinks easy. If you are hop head like me (93 IBU's) you need to get this brew when it's available. I am on my second 1/6 this year!","JAlvy","Apr 14, 2013"

Highly drinkable with a certain panache to it, next to no alcohol detected, and complex in character. One of those six packs that tends to be not as well stocked as the surrounding ones in the cooler, and the store owner mentioned that they limit him on how many he can be allotted. Nugget Nectar is a great beer that is not available locally for me, but worth the effort to stock up on as it is worthy of the "beer archive" status in my garage fridge. Fans of IIPA would do well to try Troegs Perpetual IPA, which is of a different character","Hendry","Apr 04, 2013"

Drank a few down before I noticed that the ABV was a nice 7.5%...well balanced and simple pine and citrus favors do an excellent job of masking the alcohol content with little to no warming effect. I found these really easy to drink even though I'm just starting to warm up to hop heavy brews. I'm more of a porter / stout fan, but even a hop noob like me can see why they call this "nugget nectar"! Awesome label too!!","HarryPotHead","Mar 30, 2013"

When I smell this beer, I don't know why but It reminds me of Christmas. Taste is unlike any other beer I have had, I can't place it, it starts out like an APA, but bites on the finish like a west coast IPA, the best of both worlds I guess.

Smell isn't very strong, but is very sweet. It smells almost like peach (or nectarine to be more appropriate). The bitterness and sweetness are very well balanced here with just a hint of pine aftertaste. Mouth quite smooth and tastes very crisp and refreshing. Not very heavy either. After hearing so much about this ale, I have to agree, this is a great tasting beer. Incredibly different. I would recommend this to not only hopheads, but any beer advocate out there.","MisSigsFan","Mar 01, 2013"

Both the strong bitterness from the hops and acidity from the citrus flavor is a bit too complex. At 93 IBUs it doesn't really need as much citrus that is in it. I'm not sure if it's from the hops or if they added orange peel or coriander. It's complex enough where it won't pair well with too many foods because all the different flavors will clash. It's a pretty good beer, but I won't be buying it again.","mttfrog13","Feb 18, 2013"

This is both quite hoppy and yet very well balanced, and while that's a pretty contradictory statement, Nugget Nectar seems to defy logic. Regardless of what you call it, it's one of the tastiest hoppy beers out there and must be tried. Extra points for not being priced in the stratosphere: under $12 for a sixer.","gr0g","Feb 12, 2013"

4.17,-3.7,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"The beer pours a super clean candied light amber, even bordering on orange a little. The head sits at a nice fingers’ width with creamy tight bubbles, which help to make this beer appear quite beautiful in the glass. The beer’s body is practically lager clean, letting almost all of the light through the beer and showing a nice lazy stream of bubbles streaming up the beer. The beer’s lacing is thin and slippery, leaving very little to look at, and really not helping the beer’s appearance. On the nose, this beer smells sweet and resiny. Pine dipped in light caramel bursts onto the nose, reminiscent of big IPA’s smells. The malts do get a little too sweet at times, but overall this smell is enticing. On the tongue the beer tastes crisply bitter and sweet. The beer begins with sweet caramel, melding into sweet piney grapefruit, which blossoms over the tongue, briefly hinting at medicinal flavors before pulling it solidly into resiny pine hops. The finish rings with bready sweet caramel malts, which levels out the beer and brings some balance to the palate, allowing this beer to give a nice big bitter hop bite while still kissing the sweet malts of a traditional amber/red ale. On the mouth, this beer feels thin to medium in body, but clean and crisp, almost like a lager. The mouth is left dry and resiny with a little bit of sweet lingering with saliva in the cheeks of the mouth. Overall, this is a tremendous India Red Ale or whatever you feel fit to call it. I feel like a new style in amber/red ales is coming soon, and this is a beautiful early example of the style. Hoppy like an IPA, yet still sweet and bready on the finish, this beer does some lovely balancing. The bitters do unfortunately hit a place where medicinal aspirin flavors hit the palate, but that fades quickly and doesn’t really downsize the drinkability of this beer. In terms of other India Red Ales, I would note Nugget Nectar as being highly drinkable, and oddly sessionable for its 7.5% ABV. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Feb 08, 2013"

Each whiff and each sip brings out different flavors. Citrus zest, tropical fruits, pine/resin, caramel sweetness, malts. Medium body, pleasant carbonation, smooth and sticky. This brew will also be close to my heart as it put me deep into the craft beer world.","ChrisL24481","Feb 06, 2013"

Anyway, NN is a good beer, one of the best offered by Troegs. If you can get it, you should, it's worth a try, but not what I remember from last year.

Insane retention and sticky lace. Aroma is fresh starfruit, coconut, oily tropical nuts, vanilla, ruby red grapefruit. Taste is fruity, fresh, juicy, oily, lightly sweaty, lots of melon and mango peel. Softly bitter. No dry bitterness and no astringency. Simple, fresh, fruity. Probably the best east coast IPA aside form batch 1 super fresh Humidor Jai Alai, which I will never have again. 2/27/2011","tarheels86","Nov 13, 2012"

Tastes are full and bold, malty and hoppy, bready, caramel, toasted grain, alcohol is a bit hot, spicy hop, pungent, earthy hops, juicy, some tropical notes also - great complexity! Mouth-feel is creamy and resiny, while the alcohol leaves a prickle on the tongue. Overall, exquisite balance and complexity here. Definitely a treat, don't pass it up!","barnzy78","Sep 15, 2012"

Taste is full of orange and tropical fruit, pineapple, sweet malt comes in mid palate-finish, zesty peel in the aftertaste.

With what I know now, it's even more impressive- every element in balance, it's the Zen of the amber ale. Fresh, half a year old, on tap, growler, whatever- it stands a cut above.

Smell is up front with pine and citrus. The flavor is certain hop forward. The trio of hops used certainly is potent. But it's not overwhelming, which I enjoyed. There was a sweetness from the malt that gave a nice counterbalance to the tartness of the hops. Pretty smooth on the palate for such a hoppy beer, over 7% no less. You could tell that this beer was brewed with a degree of finesse to be able to achieve this level of retrained assertiveness.","morebeergood","Jun 02, 2012"

It really reminded me of a more well-rounded version of Stoudt's Double IPA, which I had similar feelings about. That being said, this was a really well-done brew that has quite a bit going for it. Really glad I got to try it, and very well-crafted, but this was not for me.","travMI13","Apr 23, 2012"

Scent is quite hoppy with some lovely citrus aroma...a bit of pineapple as well. The aroma somewhat remind me of Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale. A slight malt profile...but not much...possibly caramel. Love the mixture of tropical and citrus hops in this one. Taste is outstanding! Such a complex "hoppy amber ale"...just call it an IPA for crying out loud. Very clean and well balanced. Some nice caramel and bread-like malt flavors with intense hoppiness that has everything you would love in a hoppy IPA, but without the lingering bitterness. Not one flavor dominates, as they all pull their own weight nicely. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a refreshing finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I absolutely love this beer.

4.33,0,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The head and the color were both pleasant, the microfoam-like white head contrasting nicely with the amber hued beer. The nose is a little spicy and citrusy, with a nice caramel malt presence. But, the nose is misleading–this thing is packed with complexity (though it's still balanced). Bread and sweet malt mix with pine, spices, and orange-and-grapefruit citrus bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice, though I feel like it could be a little less carbonated (but that's my bias for ambers). Still, almost perfect, and definitely amazing. I wish I could brew something like this: so balanced and so complex.","ThePortlander","Apr 08, 2012"

The smell does nothing to prepare you for the taste when it hits your tongue--amazingly powerful! I was really glad to find that this was a heavily hopped beer with real malt balance, unlike so many other extremely hoppy beers. The balance and mouthfeel are where this one really shines: a perfect amount of malt to back up all those piney hops, and a decently heavy mouthfeel, but not one that makes the beer heavy overall. Honestly, I had trouble putting this down and before I knew it had downed most of it. Definitely worth picking up as much of it as your fridge/wallet will allow!","coombuyah26","Apr 02, 2012"

The first one I had I thought I was in a heavenly place. I felt like I was in the scene of Beerfest when they try the secret recipe for the very first time. It was the first time I tried a beer that hit on almost every aspect of a beer. I would recommend this to anyone to try along with any of Troegs Brewing Company's brews.","sidewinder1315","Mar 29, 2012"

4.17,-3.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a bright mahogany with only a wisp of white head. The aroma is not quite what I was expecting. The hops are potent but not in the sweet citrus arena. Instead I get deep sticky resin pine that was mixed with thick dark caramel and two cranks of a pepper mill. I really like that this displays a different end of the hop spectrum than is usually used. The taste is really nice. The thick dark caramel malts really create a solid thick base for the strongly herbal spicy hops to jump off from. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, not quite imperial stout thick, but definitely thicker than anIPA. Overall I really like this unique beer. It feels like a hybrid combining the best elements of a strong amber ale, with the hop forwardness of an IPA. Definitely worth seeking out.","quirkzoo","Mar 21, 2012"

I must say I may have been right about that 6 pack I based my review on because this tastes really different. Not over the top, but more on Q of how it is usually described on taste. I must say it was much more worthy of some praise beyond this initial review. I found the carbonation and hop forwardness more prevalent here and it makes an impression worth noting.","beercat11","Mar 10, 2012"

Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of lots of citrus zest, herbal hops, and some tropical fruit aromas. Taste is super hoppy with citrus zest and tropical fruit flavors up front with a herbal hop quality on the finish. There is a pretty assertive bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a wonderful hop presence in the aroma and taste.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 09, 2012"

The aroma is a fabulous combination of fresh pine, orange and grapefruit hops with an underlying thick caramel maltiness. Smooth, oily feel with lazy carbonation. Pine and citrus hop flavors bounce back and forth from beginning to end with a solid caramel malt backbone. Although characterized as an amber ale, this to me is the perfect IPA.

Aromas of rich, resiny, wet, green hops on a subtle caramel backbone, with some subtle grapefruit highlights. Flavors are extremely complex and layered, with a hop forward blast of peppery and resiny hops, with grassy and cedar characteristics as well. Caramel malt backbone remains subtle, serving as a canvas for the diverse hops profiles more than anything. This is a tasty beer. The aftertaste is rich and bitter, with a resiny, oily, and peppered hop profile that helps to dry the tongue, transitioning to a clean, slightly slick finish. You get a bit of a cut grass and cedar linger on the roof of the mouth, which is very pleasant. Very solid, tasty brew!","GarthDanielson","Mar 06, 2012"

This is a well-balanced beer that will satisfy anyone looking for a hoppy beer, a malt beer (once you let it warm a bit), and a distinctly American beer. Great job over at Tröegs in making this beer. I’m not sure how it could be improved in many ways, to be honest . . . maybe 16oz cans? :-) Keep up the good work, Tröegs. But please do put Perpetual in sixers.","fmccormi","Mar 03, 2012"

The first thing to hit your nose from the aroma is a juicy sweet fruit scent, like strawberry and mango, with a foundation of 'resinous' hops. There a pronounced freshness here, reminding me of clean linen or talc. The flavor is overwhelmingly the earthy hops with only a subtle bit of malt in the background. Wow, this easily could pass for an IPA. The hop bitterness in the finish is great - it really has a great bite!

4.34,0.2,4,5,4,4,4.5,"I guess this is supposed to be the imperial version of Hop Back. That it is! Crack 'er open very fresh bottle, bought 6 days after it was officially realeased for the year. Pours into my pint glass with a half a finger's head. Smells very hoppy, enough to burn your eyebrows if you get to close! First sip, definitely an intense hop bite, enough to almost make you cross your eyes. Bitterness comes more towards the end of the glug, not really up front, I think that what makes the experience very memorable. Bitterness is lingering between sips. Slightly thicker than a hop back. Almost comparable to a 120 minute without the unpleasantly high alcohol or syrupy taste. A very enjoyable strong hoppy beer, too bad its very hard to get a lot of it!","dashmartino","Feb 26, 2012"

Pours, true to the style, a brilliant amber hue with a very creamly, lush, two finger head that sticks around for a LONG time, and leaves some of the most lovely lacing ever to grace the wall of a pint glass. The nose is lightly hoppy and pleasant, although a bit muted. There's nothing offensive about this at all despite what I already know to be the overall hoppiness of the beer. No pine here, and a very mild citrus at best. The taste on this is absolutely killer. This is about as drinkable a beer as I've had across all styles. The hops are simply perfect. This puts most IPA's to shame in such a manner that were it to be classified as an IPA, it would absolutely lay waste to a good chunk of the big boys out there. The mouthfeel is marvelous too. A perfect mix of sweet and bitterness that leaves the palate cleanly. This is an insanely good beer...and one I'm thrilled to have two cases of.","Retail1LO","Feb 19, 2012"

So not ideally fresh but I can imagine how wonderful this beer is newly bottled. There is a nice caramel dimension with the age on it. I will have to snag a fresh bottle some time in order to truly enjoy this beer as it is meant to be. Really glad I got an opportunity to try it though.

4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear amber, with slightly off-white head. Aroma of sweet floral hops, resiny, with some fruit like apricot and mandarin orange. This beer has a great smell, just sweet dank hops. Taste is sweet but bitter hops, mellowed by sweet malts, with very subtle caramel notes. Mostly hops on the finish, leaving you with hoppy breathe. Though this beer is sweet, it’s not sickly sweet, molasses / sugar-cane like or anything. Not like a barley-wine. Rather, it has a remarkable bittersweet character that really distinguishes this one from other beers. Full bodied but not heavy in the sense of a stout or imp. ipa, soft but bitter mouth feel. "Nugget nectar" really does accurately describe this brew. Cheers.","AllHatDavidson","Sep 06, 2011"

4,-7.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, this is an over-the-top malty and bitter hopped beer that lays a solid claim on the amber/red world, while giving chase to many west coast style IPAs.

4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and though it's listed on the bottle as an "Imperial Amber," it seems to me that it more resembles an IPA, though with a distinctive and wonderful fruitiness. The bitterness may be too strong for anyone who doesn't like IPAs in the first place, but for hop lovers, this is a great beverage.","jondeelee","Aug 09, 2011"
4.92,13.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"This was one of my favorite beers of the year. I had it back in the fall, and it was on tap for a good two weeks at Cambridge Commons, so naturally I was there 4+ times over the course of those two weeks--just for nugget nectar. Gave some to my girlfriend at the time (who ordered a Flower Power) at one point, and she took it from me, and I ended up with the flower power. The drinkability is incomparable, and it has an amazing light grapefruit, herbal type flavor to it that is indescribable. I would drink this all day if I could just get my hands on some more.","beerman999999","Aug 08, 2011"
4.33,0,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D/O- Loved it. Even for a style that is beginning(?) to be quite watered down, this stands out. Have had this since Dark Lord Day...time to pop it, overdue actually. Wouldn't mind getting a fresher bomber next year. Troegs!","Duff27","Aug 07, 2011"
4.5,3.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O/D- This is one bomber that I'm glad I'm sharing, because it's boozy. An excellent, wonderful beer but not one that I could or should drink more than a glass of. Way tasty and I will savor every sip.","fdkayti","Aug 06, 2011"
4.5,3.9,4,4,5,5,4,"The Rest: A nice creamy body and just an absolute blast of piney hops makes this one of my top three seasonals. One of its only flaws is a slightly muted aroma compared to the taste. Never the less, I look forward to this beer every year.","curasowa","Jul 29, 2011"
4.83,11.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I tried this beer for the first time last February and has become one of my favorite beers. Its got everything I love about an amber ale. When opened, it hits you in the face with a very pungent citrus aroma It pours a rich dark amber color with a thick caramel head. Not only is the amount of mouthwatering nugget hops present, but also holds well as an overall balanced beer. Overall this is an exceptional beer and I cannot wait until it comes out again this winter.","BlackMath","Jul 26, 2011"
4.4,1.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"O: Well-rounded is an understatement with this beer; it hits the spot in so many ways. My favorite Amber Ale to date, and it will be hard to beat. I can’t see it getting any better than this; that is, of course, unless I can get it fresh.","BarryMFBurton","Jul 24, 2011"
4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Amber red colored beer that wasn't opaque and had a nice ince of white foam on it. It disappeared to some nice spots and other lace on the side. Smell of some caramel backbone with good hopps. This is a really great smelling hoppy red. It tastes about like it smells, which is just a really good hoppy amber/red ale. Fantastic for the style, I really enjoyed this one and am glad I have a few bottles left. Goes well with pizza.","RodneyX","Jul 24, 2011"

3.9,-9.9,4,4,4,3,4,"O: All in all I have to revisit this with a fresher offering. The flavors are really so spot on, and the only things that are slightly off with it could be improved with freshness. There's nothing wrong with this beer even with some age on it, it's just that the volume is a bit too low on things that certainly are much brighter in their youth.","Cavery","Jul 11, 2011"
4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"According to Chambic this bottle was near 2 years old, so I've tried to be very lenient in my rating of this. To keep it short, I really enjoyed this beer. I typically don't like hop-bombs but this just delivered such a flavorful heavy hop-centric smell and flavor that mellowed out a bit in the taste and allowed the other flavors to bloom out a bit. I would love to have this fresh and would love even more to have this fresh and on-tap. To think that this is an imperial amber just leaves me stunned. High marks to this original and delicious beer.","Klym","Jul 11, 2011"
4.5,3.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I’m convinced after having 10+ bottles of this that it is infinitely better in bomber format. Pours a clear orange amber with a dense, sticky lacing, yellow, creme head. Insane retention and sticky lace. Aroma is fresh starfruit, coconut, oily tropical nuts, vanilla, ruby red grapefruit. Taste is fruity, fresh, juicy, oily, lightly sweaty, lots of melon and mango peel. Softly bitter. No dry bitterness and no astringency. Simple, fresh, fruity. Probably the best east coast IPA aside form batch 1 super fresh Humidor Jai Alai, which I will never have again.","DustinPowers74","Jul 09, 2011"
4.25,-1.8,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours a orangey golden-amber, often with a slight haze. A nice rocky, white head retains well, and leaves a nice layer of lacing on the glass and your lips. Aroma of fresh citrus and pine, hops of all varieties...it's so juicy and tantalizing. Explosion of hops on the tongue, yet mellow enough to just ride under the border of being an IPA, even with a 90+ IBU count. Orange zest, orange blossom, sweet pale malts, grapefruit, tangerines, pine, resin, grass...it's all here in perfect quantities. Medium body, full flavor, finishes smooth and dry and leaves you wanting more.","Rifugium","Jul 06, 2011"

This brew is significantly more spicy on tap and warming than both the bottle and cask offerings I recently consumed. It is medium to full bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. This brew is good, nay it is fantastic. However, this brew falls victim to the fresher the better. If you can get this beer fresh it is absolutely world class, an A+ offering. I never thought I would be saying this but bottles of this beer I have enjoyed for the past 4 months have been significantly more enjoyable than each and every one of my draft experiences, this one included.","stakem","Jun 15, 2011"

The aroma on this beer is wonderful. It smells like a citrusy floral IPA. It's makes my mouth water just smelling it. The taste is piney and citrusy. It's very bitter and pretty much a kick in the mouth. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy, not heavy enough to keep you from having multiple over the course of some time. Overall this beer is quite good.

Great summer/porch beer, I would recommend everyone to have at least a few on hand. It's a great beer too because non-craft beer drinkers can really enjoy it as it's lighter from some of the malty stouts.","mgoblue5743","May 16, 2011"

4.35,0.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"One of my favorite amber ales that has some serious hop bite. Color is a deep copper tone with two fingers of head and nice lacing left on the glass. Grapefruit and lemon peel aromas with not much malt presence on the nose. Flavors of citrus peel and spice are accentuated with the slightly malty undertones giving it a nice complex flavor. More of an IPA than an amber but definitely worth seeking out when its in season.","wino47","May 07, 2011"

Excellent balance in the nose: grapefruit, other tamer citrus notes like tangerine, quite floral, sweet toffee/malt. Taste is a bit tilted to the malt upfront: caramel sweetness, fruits, but in the mid-palate and finish the hops shine through in Grapefruit and Pine, and a subtle lasting bitter aftertaste.

The bitterness at first threatens to overpower the beer but with a little patience the true character begins to shine through.

The nose is some hoppy pine tones, sweet bready malts and really not much else, very muted and what im guessing is passed its time. Taste is a one dimensional hoppy bitterness with a touch of coffee and malt on the back end. With faded hop esters the malt really comes to the forefront.

Light amber in color, a long lasting sexy foamy head. Some sweet malt, some toasty malt, some caramel, a bunch of juicy hops, citrus galore with a little floral.

I have respect for a beer that is as strong as this one, as most similar IPAs tend to be 7 pushing 9%abv, but sometimes I do prefer to have a beer I can drink a few of before being unable to operate heavy machinery...thankfully I'm sitting at home writing a review only using light machinery so I can continue to drink more beer.","ThePorterSorter","Mar 11, 2011"

Flavor starts off with those tropical fruit hops, some grapefruit as well. Also some more spicy and piny hops shine through to a much lesser extent. Great amber malt background.

It was basically all hop flavor more of the citrusy strains, I actually got a little bit of green apples. The mouthfeel was nice I found it to be very bubbly for a few seconds then dissipates.

There is no alcohol burn / feel to this brew at all which makes drinkability great but also scary . Drinkability also may take a hit due to price point from store to store . Gouge maybe ?

3.8,-12.2,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer pours a golden copper color with a big white head that leaves beautiful lacing all over the glass. Not quite amber in color, but still a nice looking beer. The smell is fantastic with tons of pine and citrus in the nose. Probably the most aggressive aroma of both pine and citrus that I have smelled in one beer. There is a non-descript sweetness that balances the hops...it's almost sugary in nature. The taste is nice and bitter up front, but comes up a little too sweet in the back. Brown sugar and simple syrup that leave it a little cloying even with all the hops in there. Even with the sweetness and the hops, the taste is very empty to me and doesn't provide a lot of the nice complexity of some of the best hop bombs. Drinkability is decent but an oily mouthfeel and an oversweet finish leave me wanting a little more from this brew.","dgfair","Mar 05, 2011"
4.3,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Large, close to three finger head, mostly tan to eggshell white froth and medium-sized bubbles, above average retention, the lacing breaks into thin streaks and splotches but stays put thereafter. Spotless metallic zinc to copper color, as orange as red, multiple beads of active bubbles stream upwards. Sweet honey, pine, rose petals and then pineapple, nectarine, peach fruit blossom into the nose, the more bitter herbaceousness does not swing the pendulum too far in the other direction, the tangerine and grapefruit notes stick in the middle ground, slight cocoa to mocha powder maltiness before it all dissolves, does an excellent job of expressing hoppiness without any burn. Medium-bodied, semi-creamy texture with gently massaging carbonation, freshening lift too. Here the more tart tangelo, pink grapefruit fully equal to the pineapple, apricot, peach, apple fruit. At the same time the dusty cocoa, chocolate adds to its general dryness and erect posture. This not to ignore the quiet presence of cane sugar, molasses and caramel. Pine and tea leaves come through at the end, not especially spicy. Has the I.B.U.'s to satisfy the hophead while staying accessible to the layperson.","farrago","Mar 05, 2011"

4.33,0,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Finally found this at a beer festival outside of Philadelphia, after searching for a few months. Poured this into a Pint Glass (recommended by their website). Has an orangey/amber look to it. Head was a little off white, dissipated quickly. When you smell it, the hops punch you in the face reminds you of an IPA. Very smooth for a beer with a higher IBU. Can definitely feel the strong alcohol content. Has a dry malty taste to it, which is expected when dealing with a higher IBU. Not for your typical non-beer drinker. Overall, not quite what I was expecting but it's still a great beer. I would highly recommend this beer for anyone who enjoys IPAs. Just another reason why Troegs is becoming my favorite Brewery.","Phillysportswhiz","Mar 04, 2011"
4.18,-3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Nugget Nectar pours a crystal clear amber. The khaki colored head tops out at over three fingers in height, before displaying above average retention and coating the glass with sticky rings of lace. The nose is almost entirely a hop bomb, much more pine and resinous notes than anything citrus. I'm actually a little bit disappointed that there's no more than a faint whiff of caramel, I was expecting a little more of a malt presence for an amber. The malt really steps it up on my palate though, as there is a fairly solid dose of caramel up front. That's quickly run over by hops though, as a fairly powerful bitterness punch clears the way for lots of sticky, resiny, piny hop goodness. As with the aroma, there's a lack of maltiness in the body, the beer is a little dry. Carbonation is fine though, cuts through what sweetness there is and elevates the hops without becoming fizzy. I do love me some Nugget Nectar, it's right there with Hopslam as my one-two punch of winter hoppy releases.","axeman9182","Mar 03, 2011"

There was a decent light caramel flavor to match the grapefruit and pine. The mouthfeel was a little on the dry side, which I'm not particularly used to when it comes to this style, but then again many offering in this style don't tend to be very hoppy.

Granted it's an Amber and not an IPA, i love the balanced hop presence of citrus fruits, pineapple, lemon, ect. Just as the name describes it pours a very clear amber with a thin white head, and all the hop aroma and sweet caramel malts pour through the nose.

Not bad, just different. First off, the smell of this beer never disapoints. Apricots and the smell of hops enough that my mouth waters just thinking about it. The taste is exceptional, although I do have to say that it may take two to get the full appreciation of the flavor. This is where this years is a little different. Previous years seemed to have a slightly sweeter mouth-coating feel to them where this years doesn't have that. Not sweet, but just enough to ensure the hops bite stays with you for a few extra seconds.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium/light carbonation. A decent amber ale, but I dont see what all the fuss is about.

Two fingers worth of fluffy white head quickly dropped to a solid ring of foam. I smell an intense pine aroma along with lime and citrus notes. The smell of nugget hops plumed out of this beer upon opening. Taste is important with this brew, and I feel that I fail to describe the complexity of it. I detect at the front of the mouth intense bitter/ sweet hopness that opens into a pine grapefruit peel like flavor that moves and changes into an awesome hoppy afterflavor and burps!

Floral, medium bitterness, and a long resiny finish. Been wanting to try this for some time now since alot of people make it seem like an IPA and hoppy as hell.

The nose is all up in your face (...as are most noses, now that I think about it...) with pine backed by what seems like some creamy caramel. Yes, I can smell creamy. Deal with it. The taste follows almost exactly, heavy on the pine, a decent backbone of smooth and creamy caramel. (Told ya.) A hint of flowers is in there as well, but not in much abundance.

Certainly it was sweeter and maybe slightly less in-your-face hops, but delicious nevertheless. It still pours a beautiful golden orange. Head was almost 2-fingers with an aggressive pour which settled into a coating. Lacing was there all the way. And that heavenly smell.... Oranges, floral and piney hops. Taste - still pretty frickin' delicious. Creamy and smooth, this seems to go back and forth from the sweet fruit to hop dry and bitter with the almost honey backbone ultimately winning out. Finish is dry and refreshing. I challenge all those justifiably proud of their west coast offerings to try this beer. It is just simply great.","regspeir","May 25, 2010"

4.05,-6.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a nice deep copper, moving to amber, good clarity, a little chill haze on this one, with a decent 1-2 cm head. The head kind of falls down leaving a ring around the ed and a little pillow in the middle. Moderate lacing, but not too sticky. The smell is slightly floral and pungent hops, almost musty in there. With some raw graininess. You also get some melon smells, like honeydew, but a little bitter and resinous, with just some notes of tangerine in the end. The taste is nice. Starts out with tangerine, lime, and a bit of bitterness. Then a bit of a grainy sweetness comes in, moving to a kind of melon taste that I think is somewhat common in Nugget Hops. There's also a little pine and a tiny bit of grass and leaves, but the fleshy, bitter fruit taste seems to win here. Finishes nice and dry with a little crisp bite of bitterness. I think the body is a little thinner than I'd like, definitely on the thin side of medium, and when I drink an imperial amber, I like that sticky, bready malt body to really almost battle with the hops, letting the hops win out, but really balancing them so their fruitiness wins. The carbonation is nice, not a lot of bite, but just lively enough to let you know it's there. Overall, a pretty nice amber ale, one of the better and more enjoyable ones, it stands out in the top 3-5 of the imperial reds I've had (though this isn't the most bountiful style), but I don't think it does enough to set itself apart. I would definitely go back, maybe drink a few in a night, and I would definitely be happy.","taylorhamrick","Apr 13, 2010"

The taste is fruity, hoppy in a good way, but not bitter, caramel malts for balance. Mouthfeel is firm but not sticky. Very drinkable, though a bit boozy, IBUs are well hidden. I expected a more over the top hoppy beer given the hop bill, I thought this was exceptionally balanced and quite tasty.

4.2,-3,4,4,4,4,5,"Reviewed from my notes, based on a bottle provided by sigma23 and also split with deltatauhobbit. The beer is golden orange in color. It has a soapy white head with a few foamier patches. There is one meager stream of bubbles rising in my glass. I can smell piney, musty hops as well as a hint of sweet citrus. The flavor can be described as hoptastic. It's piney up front and bitter in the finish. The bitter aftertaste doesn't linger too long. Nugget Nectar has enough of a malt backbone to justify the imperial amber classification on the label. It has a heavy body and medium carbonation. There is some mouthcoating, but a bit less than I'd expect for 7.5% ABV. This is very drinkable. I like it a lot. Nothing about this beer would get overwhelming. I'd buy it a lot if it were distributed here.","ToasterChef","Mar 29, 2010"

Huge pine aroma, that makes me think I just shoved my head into a christmas tree. I really don't get much else besides that. Nice malty sweetness, then really a nice bitterness. From the aroma, I expected more of a bitter hop bomb, but they really got the hop flavor right, and not just the bitterness. This drinks sickeningly well for a 7.5% and seems insanely dangerous. Great carb and light mouthfeel as well. Definitely a solid beer overall and I can't think of a better beer described as an "imperial amber."","ChrisPro","Mar 28, 2010"

At the same time, because she is focusing so much on trying to be French, the rest of her performance suffers.

As I get closer, more fruity, citrusy hops aromas start come out with a just a hint of bready malts to back things up. Taste is alittle muted on the malt end, but the hops are citrusy, with hints of grapefruit and the lightest touch of pine needles. Bitterness is there, but not in large amounts. It's well balanced, and the alcohol doesn't come into play too much, but overall it's slightly muted. I understand that this bottle is a few months old and not at it's optimum flavor capacity, but it still tastes very good and can see how this could be a great beer fresh. Very drinkable for the high ABV and the large hop additions. This seems like just a good ol' drinkable IPA, rather than an amber ale.

Lots of hop bite and a touch of alcohol. There feel is pure perfection. It coats the mouth and leaves a satin residue in the finish.

There are no lingering out aftertastes, only something telling you to drink more. Nectar is a perfect description of this beer.

4.52,4.4,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Pours a clear amber color with one inch of white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Surprising lack of lacing considering the abundance of hops. Still has a little sticky lacing though. Big blast of hops in the aroma. Mostly pine scents but also a touch of citrus and grass. The malt adds some toasted qualities. No surprises with the hop flavor. Pungent and resinous. Pine and citrus battle it out for supremacy. The malt actually adds its own qualities to this beer so it is more than a lot of the hop bombs populating the shelves. Bitterness is high but not out of control considering the 93 IBUs. Medium body but hard to consider this an Imperial beer. Just enough carbonation to give some life, nice texture. Questionable drinkability at 7.5% ABV but with such nice hop flavor, I would give it my best effort. I do not think this would wear out a palate like other hop bombs.","morimech","Jan 24, 2010"

Nice and crystal clear, this is a pretty attractive beer. The nose is nice, some malt in there but mostly hops, oily hoppy resin. The taste is pretty similar to the nose, there's some malt in there but mainly it all nugget. Not a lot of complexity, not an overwhelming hop bite or kick, just a nice solid flavor. Mouthfeel is good, light to medium body, the beer just kind of rolls over your tongue with a little bit of a piney aftertaste.

The dark yet translucent amber color is simply gorgeous. Aroma is strong with scents of apricot, citrus and hops. I recently reviewed Troegs Hop Back amber ale and this to me truly does seem to be an Imperial version of that beer. For the most part I'm getting the same flavors (caramel malt, citrusy hops) but much stronger and definitely a lot more hops. This stuff is great.

Taste is where this puppy shines... the cask version i had recently was way too green with overpowering flavors on each sip. This bottle is a wonderful blend of smooth, light carmely, buttery and nutty malts backed by a wonderful citrus, earthy and floral hop taste.

4.37,0.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,"A very solid beer that I have had a few times before this. Appearance is good. Standard clear amber color is nice here and the head goes up to about two fingers with decent retention. It was very creamy looking while it lasted and leaves pretty thick lacing behind. During the drinking a white cloud stays on top of the beer. Smell, to me, is the best part about this beer. A blast of hops hits the nasal passage with lots of citrus, pine and grapefruit notes. I can get some malt in the background, which is nice in this very strong aroma. It basically smells like a very good IPA/DIPA. Taste is a bit too bitter to me and throws the balance off. The huge citrus, pine and grapefruit notes stick around very well. The bitterness from the hops basically demolishes my palate, even after having a huge amount of hop bombs. I get some pale malt taste behind the hops, which helps to balance this beer out. Without some of the bitterness, this beer would be much better IMO. This beer actually reminds me a LOT of Celebration Ale, now that I think of it. Mouthfeel is right on for the taste. Medium bodied, medium carbonation feel good, some creaminess. Huge bitterness and hop flavors stay on the tongue, crazy coat of bitters, damn. No alcohol taste or feel really in this beer. This beer is actually so bitter, it reminds me of the time I ate a hop pellet, bad memories. Drinkability is decent. The one reason is that the super bitterness makes htis one hard to drink a whole bomber. The price is good for such a big beer, maybe in a month or so some of the bitterness will die down and it will remind me of last year's Nugget Nectar. I have never had it this so fresh, maybe my taste has just changed since last year. I still enjoy this beer through the bitterness, nice job by Troegs and very affordable for once (wish more breweries followed the example).","cbutova","Jan 18, 2010"

Yes it has high IBU's but the balance and taste of this beer makes the bitterness very mild IMO. Damn it I wish this was easier to get. I would buy a ton of this if it was available.

The taste initially hits you with all of the aforementioned citrus, then blends beautifully mid-palate with the malt and caramel flavor, and then finally climaxes at a bitter dry finish that leaves you thirsting for your next sip. Decently carbonated and a thicker body (almost syrupy) than expected, but it blends surprisingly well with the flavor profile so you don't even notice.

Very strong "C" hop aroma, with light citrus, pine, and some otherwise tea-like notes. Biscuity malt in the taste, backed up by loads of fruity, bittering hops. Actually, the bittering is a bit too strong. No real yeast character, unfortunately. Full bodied, but slightly syrupy.

Citrus hops hit the nose first, followed by some sweet malts and spice and oddly enough, a very subtle butterscotch. Smells like and IPA obviously. Tastes of more citrusy and oily hops which are wrapped with lemon, some banana and other fruits, and some malts. Goes down silky, despite the overall bitter nature it has.

Some nodes are more traditional--grapefruit, generic citrus, pine, but there's something to this blend. Warrior hops produce the exact same aftertaste as Alpha King, Simcoe gives it the same explosive start as 60 min... but still, there's something else, something fantastic that I can't put my finger on. Maybe it's that the malt is so subdued, that the beer lets the yeast do the balancing so the hops can frolic freely. I dunno. It's damned amazing, though.","mynie","May 27, 2009"
4.57,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The beer is a clear amber liquid with a frothy head. If it wasn't labeled as an "Imperial Amber," I'd probably just guess it was a DIPA, as I have seen DIPAs darker than this. The aroma is a lovely blend of hops. I suspect that Simcoe found its way into the mix. Every hoppy beer brewer should consider Simcoe in their recipes. Anyway, the aroma is floral/citric hops, like honeysuckle and grapefruit rind. The flavor is similar but adds in a nice sweet malt that keeps the beer away from over-bitterness. The feel is clean with a good bitter bite in the aftertaste. For my money, this is an exceptionally drinkable beer. It tastes great, there's complexity in the hops to make you want more and it doesn't overwhelm in any capacity. One of the best hoppy East coast beers that I've tried so far (Double Simcoe being the other that comes to mind). Also, it paired excellently with a DiGiornio Mushroom and Spinach pizza, so yeah, my beer was significantly better than my dinner.","popery","May 27, 2009"

Not too sure I like the feel here, a little too heavy, more carbonation would help to lighten it. This is another one of those beers thats reputation is huge, you hear that its completely awesome and blows everything away....then you taste it and find that the only thing that is blown away is this specific beer's reputation. Too much street cred. This is a good beer, don't get me wrong, but I think that now, its riding its own coattails. Not that I won't buy it agian, but when I do I'll know that its not worth $12.99-13.99. Glad I tried it, but really not worth the dollars.

One inch bright white head sizzled and popped as it slowly receded into a quarter inch consistent cap; thick bands of lacing coated the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose suggests grapefruit with piney hops hidden in the back. Taste is not as sweet as the nose suggested. Flavors are piny, floral and slightly resinous on a malty backbone with the citrus quality coming across as citric acid astringency. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background carbonation; a little oily on the tongue, but also a little bit of citric acid burn as the brew hits your mouth and tongue that slowly dissipates as it's swallowed.

I'd drink it often enough if easier to obtain (it should be in the future - Troegs is distributed here now). I wonder... How it compares to Cascazilla. Probably not all that well.

Well made but the texture of the water doesn't remind me of beer. I like that the beer retains a sweet and clean amber flavor on top of the crazy hops.

Hazy copper with basically no head. Smelled fantastic. Amazing hop freshness, as with the HopSlam, but this had a little more malt balance. Tasted wonderful. I might enjoy this beer more every time I have it, and drinking it from a cask was definitely an experience. So amazingly fresh, so pure hops, so sweet malt, so well balanced. Not sure if there was a fault in this one. Thick but not too thick, very silky with no carbonation, strong but no noticeable alcohol. This is a perfectly tamed beast. It's the porridge that's just right. Some people might prefer HopSlam for it's more extreme bitterness.

Citrussy minty pithy grassy hops dominate at first, with plenty of caramel toffee malt, with hints of chocolate and caramel malt to balance this beer and make it not a complete hop bomb, though it's definitely hop-forward.

There are some slight caramel malts underneath, and they are sweet, so the whole just wonderfully complements each of the constituent components. This is a medium bodied beer with a 7.5% ABV that is well hidden. You won't know the strength of the beer otherwise. The finish is sweet, the aftertaste quite mild and refreshing, more than biting and lasting. There is a touch of drying nuttiness in the finish.

Big hop nose on this one, maybe there's some malt in there, I can't really pick it out. Taste is nothing like the nose, and in a very good way. Very refreshing smooth sweet malty brew with a beautiful bitter finish. I think I like this because even with the floral grassiness it lacks that pine tree bitterness that would lead to this being a little out of reach for most people. Very well balanced smooth creamy beer. The hops are very nicely balanced with smooth carmamel malt backbone that makes this an extremely drinkable brew. Pleases the hopheads with the bitterness and pleases everyone with it's drinkability. This would be an amazing everyday brew if I could get it everyday.

The flowery, citrusy hops dominate, which goes right with the bitterness experiences upon swallowing. I was expecting the alcohol to show its head but it never did.

If I tasted this blind I'd call it an DIPA, because the citric hops are just oh so prominent, but there is definitely a nice light, sweet, malt backdrop that compliments the hops perfectly.

A sweet hop smell right out of the gate. Smells of mango and cat urine come together and make a very unique boutique. Gulp. Crazy hop on the palate, the sticky nature of the beer along with the sweetness make for some beer. The gulp factor is extremely high which is seldom in most imperials that I've drank in the past. If you like hops and hoppy red ales this should be your beer of choice.

The swirls of pastel colors (no it's not soap residue). the smell is amazing, just like raw hop pellets. soft hops, no pine or grapefruit. The flavor is all hops, even though they are soft, there is just a dominating flavor. This beer is a good example that a lot of hops does not always mean bitter (60/90/120 min IPA as well). These are floral, herby, aroma hops with low acidity or else this would be an extreme-double-imperial-hophead-hopzilla-American-west coast IPA (any other hoppy beer sland terms?). But it's just not my style. I like more balance to my beers, the malt front on this beer just doesn't hold up. I have noticed over the years my pallet has tolerated more and more hops and appreciated them; this beer is about where I draw the line of enjoyable hops to pointless overdone hops. So for the style I have to say it's pretty good. Mouthfeel is oily from all the hops, slick. it leaves your lips sticky. Drinkability, I probably could only handle 2 of these per night. It's just too heavy and assaulting on my pallet.","danadeny","Feb 06, 2009"

The flavor is extreme hop, that flavor seems a little more citrus like than was noticed in the nose. The three hop varieties here, Tomahawk, Nugget and Warrior have a nice mix that, though in your face and extreme, play nice with a fairly recognizable malt back ground. Though the hop presence is big and lingers through out at the back of the mouth it is not to the point that I get sick of it, does not have that slick sticky feeling I notice in some. I am saying this because I am not a hop head and don't care for many hop bombs, but this one is nice.

It's plenty of hoppy goodness, with lots of citrusy, tropical fruit and grassy hops, along with a sweet and biscuity malt backbone. Excellent mix of hops and malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy hops (grapefruit, orange zest, mango), grassy/pine hops and sweet/biscuity malt. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, a bit creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and goes down very easy.

This slowly receded into a slick of bubbles that remained with some considerable lacing sticking to the side of my glass. The nose on this beer was outstanding with deep rolling notes of pine hops mixed with just the slightest bit of caramel maltiness and a slightly boozy effect with a deep pull of air. The first blush revealed an immensely full bodied flavor mixing a sharp alcohol with grapefruit and pine hop flavoring and just the hint of malty backbone that any "imperial" should possess. The carbonation was nice and gentle leaving a creamy and altogether pleasing effect on my mouth. It was slightly warming in the finish and the perfect beer to drink in the humid monsoon of the Korean summer. After consideration I would say that this beer reminds me of a slightly higher octane version of Victory's Hop Devil. Simply delightful.

4.75,9.7,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Pours a lovely crystal clear deep amber with a nice two finger creamy off white head that never completely goes away and leaves nice lacing. Hops are very much at the forefront. Lots of citrus and a fair amount of floral notes. No perceivable alcohol but some of the sweet malt comes through (but just a bit). Taste follows the aroma with plenty of hops, but this really is an imperial amber, not an IPA, and the malts come through bold and slightly sweet. Finish is just bitter enough and stays right on the tongue. Mouth is medium creamy and has very pleasant carbonation. I love this beer. I'm glad they don't make it year 'round because I might not buy much else. I can't wait until next year!","Med","Jun 23, 2008"

Tastes pretty much like what the picture on the bottle shows - like someone managed to squeeze all of the oily essence out of some hops and bottle it up. Somehow not overpowering while maintaining its intensity, a hint of citrus from the hops used and a creamy texture add up to a brew I cant wait to have more of in the future!","punkindrublic50","Jun 18, 2008"

This is my second bottle of this...I've got one left, and I'll be actively searching out more. If this was available locally, I'd have it in my fridge all the time.

Taste is right on cue with a hoppy fluffy bitterness, sweet honey like taste with a mouth watering finish, the resin stayed for a while on my tongue.

Little bits of caramel sweetness, but not much. Fairly one sided but pulls it off extremely well. In lew of an aftertaste there is a vibrant tingling sensation. But after that passes the caramel malts start to shine through, there they are. A parade of high aplha acid West Coast hops. A hop heads wet dream of an Amber.

If you like the Hopback Amber this is basically a juiced up version, so for hopheads like me the taste is right on. A nice balance of heavy hoppyness. Going down it's crisp and bitter, with a very clean aftertaste. The amped up hop action might be too much for some, but for those that enjoy it you could definitely swill more than one.

Knowing nothing of brewing I have no idea what they used but it was sweet and not too bitter which you find in many overly hopped beers. Something balanced it out perfectly. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy with medium carbonation. Overall I REALLY enjoyed this beer a lot. I see why people buy this by the case.

Leans very strongly toward the citrus end of things like the smell, but also a weaker piney taste. My favorite part is probably how soft and smooth this feels in the mouth.

It's very good, don't get me wrong, but I tend to like a bit more balance & complexity, especially with an amber ale. The mouthfeel is upper echelon: medium body, perfect carbonation level, and a sticky bitter hop finish. Alcohol makes a quick appearance, hitting the sides and back of the palate. Not only is Nugget Nectar a hoppy ride for the senses, but it's actually quite easy to drink. I could see myself getting carried away with a six pack.

The aroma was so strong that you could smell this beer being poured. It was that powerful! This strong aroma consisted of pine, citrus fruits, citrus hops, and a light touch of toasted malts. It the beer is swirled around, a tiny juicy fruit aroma will emerge from the background. It had strong bitter taste of citrus hops, citrus fruits, and quite a few pine needles. I couldn't detect any malts or anything thing else in the taste because all the citrus bitterness this beer offered covered everything else up, except for the pine of course. It was more of a full bodied beer than medium bodied beer. That's because it had a strong long lasting aftertaste of pine, citrus hops, and citrus fruits. This aftertaste won't leave your tastebuds alone until you drink a few cups of water to wash it all away. This is another winner from the Tröegs brothers!

Balanced smells of citrusy hops and some sweet malt, somewhat spicy with hop oils. Flavor is where its at. Huge fresh flavors of oily hops with lots and lots of delicious pine, a decent malt base to support the hops, and a long moderate piney bitterness. Delicious, and most impressive to squuze all that piney goodness into a 7.5% abv beer. Mouthfeel is ample- good full body without being over the top. Firm, and almost oily from all the hops.

Creamy white head that leaves decent lacing and lasts all the way down the pint glass. Smells of hops, with some hops, and other hops, not to mention the floral and citrusy smells, too. Tastes of sweet hops, bitter hops, and some caramel/apricot, maybe some peach in there, too?-- amazing blend of the flavors.

The taste makes me shocked to see that this is classified as an amber, or imperial amber as troegs calls it. To me this beer is most defenitely an IPA. Granted, imperial ambers can be somewhat hoppy, it is way too similar to an IPA. Hops dominate right up front with a strong presence. some spice through the middle but mostly just a bunch of hopalicious hoppiness with a nice bitter finish, but not too astringent. Certainly a great beer, but I dont know why this isnt just called an IPA. Mouthfeel is that of an IPA. Drinkability is quite high, as the hop flavors are very thick, but the finish is not too terribly bitter. Certainly a great beer.

There is also some candy sweetness rounding it out giving a nod to the toasty malts. On the palate, the hops open up even further. The "trifecta" of hops as they call it do some pretty good assulting, the bitterness is ever present. The finish is just slightly sweet, but man, those hops keep coming.

Definitely gets you excited to try it. The taste was outstanding. You get that great hops bite without the bitter end that you find in some IPA/DIPA's. This one goes down smooth from start to finish.

Flavour is surprisingly balanced after the hop blast, with a solid backbone of caramel/vanilla malt supporting the grapefruit-and-pine hops. Some definite yeasty and roasted notes in there as well.

Fairly nice balance of hops and malt, actually. Son enough, though, the fairly strong hops hit you. Nice floral esters. Light fruity flavors as well, that apricot is sitting in the background.

4.02,-7.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Sampled in a pint glass. Nice clear orange color; light head that lingers to the end. Muted hops smell; not the overwelming nose of a hopbomb. The first sip is nice on the tongue and has a malty feel rather than the over the top pine resin notes of a overhopped beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and goes down real nice. A lite hop tingle remains on the tongue afterwards. The ABV of this beer around 7.5, but you would not know it from the sample and it could get you if you are not on your game.. Better to slowdown and enjoy this treat. This beer does a fine job of combinding heavy hops with a nice malt foundation.","mobud","Mar 07, 2007"

I waited a dew minutes for the head too settle and took a whiff. The smell was of nice dank, grassy hops and a little floral. The taste did not disappoint and also had a floral and grassy taste. It was very herbal, dank, and completely delicious. Nugget Nectar is very easy to drink given the smooth mouth-feel and the fact that the alcohol doesnt seem to be present to the taste. I would buy several cases when it is released every year but alas I live in Colorado and not Pennsylvania. The other two bottles I have left will be thoroughly enjoyed.

No visible carbonation in the glass, which was crystal clear, no hint of any hazy or cloudiness. Smell was strong bitter hops, pine resin grapefruit, pineapple were the big players here. A very slight tinge of alcohol as it warmed tingled the nose a bit. The taste was a little thin, watery, but not too bad, just would have envisioned a bit fuller based on the smell. Biggest taste here was the grapefruit, big dry piney finish left this very nice. Good well rounded IPA. Overall this is a very good call.

4.67,7.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Found the six-pack in June and almost shit myself as I knew that up until then it was a draft-only release. Naturally, I had to buy it because not only is Tröegs one of my favorite breweries, but I am also a hophead, so this was a real find. Four bottles later I've finally done a full review: 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date and a declaration of "93ish IBUs." It pours an unfiltered red/copper with a half-inch ecru head and low carbonation. The aroma consists of fairly strong piney/citric (orange) hops that have a minty or herbal element. On the palate it is almost syrupy, drying, and lightly numbing, with low to medium carbonation, starting with strong pine/citric hops, notes of orange, apricot?, and pear, well balanced by sugary, biscuity, caramelly, and toasty malts that tame the hops, seemingly reclaiming some of their IBUs. As it warms I find notes of coffee and the bouquet becomes more pronounced. The finish is nice and lingering, making me not want to eat or drink anything that would erase any last traces of this wonderful brew. I wonder if anyone else will try an "imperial amber ale," or, for that matter, if they could make it as tasty. I doubt it.","mmmbeer","Oct 20, 2006"

Magnificent citrus aromas: Satsuma pith and grapefruit rind scents predominate. A sweet smell lurks beneath, caramelly I think, but for the most part inscrutable. Fantastic bitterness with the hop profile: the main flavors I pick up are citrus (grapefruit and bergamot), but there is also a killer earthy mineral flavor which emerges after the initial citric flavors burst forth -- this is unlike any other bitter flavor I've experienced. Medium-light body, juicy and refreshingly dry mouthfeel -- just what I was wanting tonight. I've been growing pretty tired of thick syrupy IPAs lately -- Nugget Nectar is not at all of that ilk and truly hits the spot.

Hops are assertive throughout, and the sweet malt character keeps it balanced. The relatively high ABV is very well masked. Delicious. Mouthfeel is medium and very creamy. Good hoppy bitterness keeps it honest. This is a user-friendly beer that doesn't shrink back from using strong hop flavors. This beer is both biting and smooth.

At first with this beer, I didn't detect much in the smell, other then the fact that it was very clean. As i let it warm up though, I noticed that the aroma was chocked full of hoppy resins and oils, giving it a zesty, spicy character. My anticipation that this would be a damn hoppy beer was fulfilled the second the glass tocuhed my lips...this is one hoppy red ale. At first I thought that it was much more IPA like then anything else, but in the end I see the red ale traits. Mouthfeel was medium bodied.

Tasted great. Not too hoppy (although I'm not sure what an "Imperial Amber," as the label suggests, is supposed to taste like), but defintely fresh and clean. Hits the front like a nice amber ale, and finishes strong like an IPA. This is a highly drinkable beer from Troegs and I would try it again (and again?) should I stumble upon it here in the District.

Light citrus hops dominate the taste at first, then allowing some degree of bready malt flavor to peek through. A small dose of bitterness lingers, as well as a nutty flavor in the finish. Some character is reminiscent of an Amber Ale, but it more like an American IPA. Medium-thick, with a minor creamy mouthfeel, the carbonation lightly pierces the front of the tongue.

Reminds me of my favorite IPAs. This is an Amber? Could have fooled me. About the IPA classification, my mouth agrees with my nose. At first, citris hops dominate, but then it moves to a sweet, toasted malty flavor that I couldn't pick up on the scent. Finishes exceptionally balanced between the hops and malts. Mouthfeel is so smooth that I'm going to give it a 5.0. I'd give it an 11 if they let me. Great, smooth, medium mouth that doesn't allow me to put the bottle down for more than a few seconds.

They combine to form a somewhat mild (using the term loosely) hop aroma. Taking a sip and letting it roll around the tougue allows the sticky hops to coat my mouth while suck-gurgling releases the hop citrus and flower burn. The finish is nicely honey and caramel malty very reminicent of the Amber style - one of my favorites. I'm slurping this down so fast I'd better be careful (I have an empty stomach).

The was a noticable amount of fruit as well such as cantelope and what i thought was pear. Taste was hops hops hops, but well balanced.

One great BA and friend he is, especially for all the beer he has helped me consume, this one included. 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep copper, almost light mahogony color with two huge fingers of foam. There's a generous portion of lacing left clining to life on the sides of the glass. The smell is something of awe. This just doesn't smell good for beer, it smells better than almost anything that's ever crossed my nose. It's that awesome. Lots of juicy hop aroma, sticky and sweet. It's perfect, really no other way to describe it. I won't even bother going on. The taste isn't fair behind. A slight sweetness moves over the tongue just long enough to make its presence known. Then's it's all hops from here. Floral and piney, all coming together. Not overly bitter, just a great hop flavor that lasts on the palate, creating a breathtaking finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and chewy. Yum yum. The drinkability is phenominal for a 7.5% brew. What a great way to spend my 600th review. A great beer from a great friend.

Malts however are never fully overcome, and pepper wins the day through the finish. Ends drying, and beautiful. Great interplay throughout. Mouthfeel is just past medium with medium low fluffy carbonation, creating a chewy texture. Scarily drinkable, in fact, I'm headed for another.

Some sweet caramel blends in to support the hops. Very clean smell as well. Plenty of bitter grapefruit notes mixed with caramel and biscuit malts get the flavor going. Piney hops are in full affect as well. Ends with some nice bitter piney hops with a touch of sweetness. Pretty well balanced while still being juicy with hops.

Sharp hop tang aftertaste and no hint of the over 7% alcohol abv. This is a very pleasant beer, but not the outstanding IPA that most people are espousing.

Burnished buttery hops, together with a biscuity type malt make this a treat for the palate. The hops were even more vibrant, but not at all a bitter beer. The lacing just cascades down the glass, and it retains a good dusting on the beer to keep things interesting. I can only imagine what this is like cask-conditioned, but for coming from a keg is it one helluva beer. Seek it out and you will definitely not be disappointed.","stingo","Feb 05, 2005"

4.79,10.6,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I was anxiously awaiting the rerelease of this beer for quite some time now, and am glad to see that I did not build it up too much in anticipation. Just as good as I remember it, which would speak volumes to anyone who has heard me rave about it in the past. Seek this out!","Erix","Jan 30, 2005"
4.13,-4.6,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Becomes low-carbonation syrupy floral mix that happened to cross my path twice at the Drafting Room...and on cask!!! Sweet!!!","blitheringidiot","Jan 06, 2005"
4.12,-4.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an amber-garnet color with a fluffy beige whipped head though the hand pump. Big flowery hop aroma with some sweet malt notes, too. Smooth and luxurious at 55 degrees. Good, balanced malty flavor, with a lesser amount of hops noticable in the taste than in the nose. Good live beer, with an impressive yeast quality throughout, but hurts in the drinkability because I feel it's a bit too sweet overall to session with. Props for a fine IPA.","crookedhalo","Apr 16, 2004"

4.77,10.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Trying this cask beer, I was expecting yet another extreme IPA that seems to be cranked out of every brewery these days. I was surprised to say the least at the Nugget Nectar. It came out with a nice creamy head and a beautiful dark yellow color. The smell was like smelling a bunch of flowers. Very fruity smelling. When it came time to finally taste this brew, it nearly blew my socks off. Although it was saturated in hop taste, it was not the type of hop taste that leaves you all puckered up. Surprisingly, this beer went down incredibly smooth. The malt to it gave the prefect balance so one could actually "taste" the hops and not be overpowered by them.","DrunkenPanther","Apr 07, 2004"
5,15.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Well I already awarded this beer a five does anybody know of a way to kick up the 5 to at least a 6 or so. Amazing on cask I enjoyed three pints without thinking about it so damn good. Appearance seemed a bit darker amber copper mix than the tap version that had a golden tone to it poured slightly hazy thick lucious cream colored creamy textured head locking in the hop aroma. Aroma contains more hops a burst of flowery earthy hops incredible smell the sugary malt backbone shines beautifully, amazing brew my friends. Taste, gets an A+ liquid crack so tasty the creamy texture of the cask conditioning is amazing the sweet malts and caramel buttery sweet flavors are orgasmic man the hop flavor bitter and hoppy as hell but completely uniform and balanced as a whole, get down on the knees I'm not worthy beer gods. Mouthfeel: Medium body fluffy texture hop resins glide across the palate. Drinkability: Wow, incredible I just traded a growler of this for a Dark Lord bomber believe me we are both making out.","WVbeergeek","Apr 06, 2004"
4.88,12.7,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is a beer that I was afraid to try (i have a mental thing against bitterness or hops) but ended up not wanting the growler to end! It poured a pretty deep red-golden colour, with a little bit of a head. It smelled like buttery hops, also malty and a bit sweet. It tasted sooo good! I thought it was very well-balanced, not too bitter but it was hoppy and also very malty and buttery and bready, I guess like nectar a bit too. Mouthfeel was rich and smooth and perfect and each sip left me wanting another! It was one of the few beers of late that actually made me smile. And if a beer makes me smile, it's definitely a good one!","erica","Apr 06, 2004"
4.25,-1.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A nice single-batch offering from Troegs. A nice strong hop presence makes this a beer that hopheads would die for, and though I'm in a bit of a malt phase, I still enjoyed this one and would gladly have it again.","beergeek279","Mar 15, 2004"
4.71,8.8,5,4,5,4.5,5,"I had about the tenth pint from the firkin and the glass lasted almost an hour(it was my third and final beer of the evening). I really wanted another but having to drive home I resorted to stealing a few sips off my buddy's glass. Among the best cask ales I've ever had.","farHillsBrewer","Mar 11, 2004"

4.03,-6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4," It is hoppy and it has some bite, but the hops are a bit more mellow than I had expected. It has good balance with some nice sweet flavors coming from the malts. The overall floral hop flavor is very pleasant, and although I could have used a little more punch, it was just fine. The mouthfeel was great from the cask, so smooth. The drinkability was also excellent, and I could see a few of these going down in a night.","ElGuapo","Mar 08, 2004"
4.07,-6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"I've gotten to try this tasty brew on cask twice now, Grey Lodge and Andy's Corner Bar. Murky brownish color with a beautiful hop aroma billowing forth from the glass. From the nose, I'd thought this would be a hop bomb in the flavor as well, but surprisingly it isn't. The hoppiness is very noticeable, but does not wreak havoc on the tongue. Note: hops which wreak havoc on the tongue are never a problem with me. Seriously though, this is very well balanced for the style. A biscuity maltiness shines through very nicely to keep this in check. Lightly citrusy and bready. Mouthfeel feels a tad thin. All in all another nice beer from a brewery that needs much more recognition.","IrishRedRock","Mar 05, 2004"

4.54,4.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer was poured an amber gold color that was crystal clear, and decently carbonated. The head that was created was beige in color and was thick, creamy, rich, full and sticky in consistency, and very long lasting. The lace that was formed was creamy in texture, sheety at first then spotty delicate in other areas, but really sticky. The aromas that came from the glass were ooh so complex, first pine needles/Christmas trees hit you, then a light citrus hop (grapefruit like) aroma comes forth, then a surprising aroma of flowers - either tulips or a dogwood tree comes forth, all kind of earthy/springy smells are always present, then as it warms spices (allspice) becomes noticeable, then grapes. The aroma is really fresh and clean. The tastes were not as complex as the aromas, but really nice. Tastes of pine needles, fresh hops, a citrus bite in the front and middle, earth tones throughout, some roasted malts (light), crunchy fall leafs, and allspice as it finishes. A dry finish to each swallow. The aftertaste was mostly dominated by piney hops. The body was medium. This is a creamy, smooth beer that is not overly hopped, and is well blended. As this beer warms and mellows, all aromas and flavors blend like a perfect dance. A well-done job from the Troegs brewery. I would like to see this as a permanent stallion in your stable.","Jarod","Feb 14, 2004"
4.47,3.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - A+!! If anyone in the area an get their hands on this, DRINK IT. If you are a hop head, you'll love it. Even if you are not, it has such a grat character. True Dat!","Edwin","Feb 12, 2004"
