It is NOT a malt bomb (like many ambers) or festooned with massively citrusy hops, (like so many brewers are using these days). While it’s abv kinda rules it out as a session beer, the combination of unique but enjoyable flavor and lower impact on the palate makes it way more refreshing than I expected.

Maybe there is some rye used as well which adds some spice and some delayed heat on the back of he throat. It fakes you out like it is going to finish clean, then there is tons of sticky resin. They've created a monster that puts you in the holiday spirit!","blindtiger24","Dec 18, 2014"

Other amber ales that I enjoyed had a toasted malt quality that was sweet but well balanced against the hops. In this beer, I feel that the hops bitterness overpowers the other tastes I associate with amber ales. Although I would not rule out buying this one again, I'm not so enthusiastic. I love six point brewery's products, however, this one is my least favorite so far.","Gajo74","Nov 15, 2014"

Flavor reveals more muddled, fruity hop flavoring, which rests on a dank bed of hops that becomes substantially bitter at the finish. I'm not a bitter fan, so too much for my liking.","barczar","Nov 14, 2014"

Aroma grounded with biscuit and toffee, maybe even a little chocolate, paired with some floral, citrus, and pine from the hops. Flavor follows suit. Overall, love this beer. Second only to Odell's Runoff Red when it comes to favorite hoppy reds. Now I just got to try some Nugget Nectar.","denver10","Nov 14, 2014"

"4.02","+2.6%","1.75","4","4.25","4","4.25","Poured straight down the middle of a large tulip style glass it resulted in a massive three finger head. After a couple of minutes the appearance had died down to a thick fluffy cap with heavy lacing on the side of the glass. Appearance is a deep hazy amber orange with more suspended particulate floating around in there than in just about any beer I’ve ever seen - I actually poured a second to see if it was just one can, but the same held true in this case as well. Looking at other Beeradvocate reviews, this seems the norm for this beer. Am I expecting too much for a beer that costs over $10 for 4-pack to actually pour clear? Oh well. Nose is a wonderful balance of sweet malt and candied nuts with strong hop notes of potent ganja and hints of spruce and pine needles. Sip is hop forward at first, with a hint of caramel followed by big piney and grass flavors on top of the bitter notes on the middle of the tongue. Mid-palate also sees candied orange and ripe apricot, orange zest, mango, a hint of cocoa and very, very light bready notes. Back of the tongue and swallow see more uniform and one-dimensional dry tannins. The finish has hints of peach jam, mandarin oranges, and piney grapefruit hop bitters with notes of lavender. One of the defining things about this beer, for me, is the mouthfeel which has a wonderfully effervescent quality - it’s not so much that it is overly carbonated so much as it is the way the carbonation feels on the tongue. In some ways it reminds me of the feeling of a Lambrusco. All in all, this is yet another exceptional beer from Sixpoint. Yes, I’m a bit irked by the particulate, but in the end, if the flavor, mouthfeel, and aroma are all terrific, and I don’t get sick from whatever is floating in the beer, then I’m a very forgiving soul. Marketed, somewhat, as a winter warmer, this is also another example of Sixpoint refusing to play by expected stylistic rules, in this case because it’s not really a winter warmer in the traditional sense. Instead, think of this as a wonderfully hoppy amber ale, somewhat akin to Nugget Nectar, albeit less sweet, more bitter, and not quite as good, which is not so much a knock against Global Warmer so much as it is a testament to how much I love Nugget Nectar :)","8stringfan","Feb 28, 2014"

I think the taste follows the aroma, but there's also some light piney hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation.

They are stylish, they allow more shelf placement and for hatas, it does not look like I am drinking beer, but Red Bull or somesuch, instead. The Crack was anything but slim, emitting a loud noise and revealing yet another brimful CAN. An inverted Glug was easy to accomplish and I quickly had to back off, lest I have overflow. The three-plus fingers of dense, rocky, light-tan head with great retention looked like a freshly-served milkshake. Color was a slightly-hazy orangish-amber and the CAN specified SRM = 17. Cool! Once more, i had some great lacing forming as the head fell. Nose was full of piney hops and I could imagine myself in a snowy pine forest by closing my eyes. Warm? Ha! The 70 IBUs had a warming impact on my tongue, however. This was one hoppy Winter Warmer, I'll tell you! That said, I am NOT complaining. "I have partaken of a number of beers in the style which were too sweet for my refined taste," he said, shaking his golden locks. This was probably Papa Bear's Winter Warmer, right before he began his hibernation. I was thoroughly enjoying the hops' presence, even through the relatively dry finish that resulted. This was my third of these beers and I CAN imagine that I will Crack open a few more before the end of winter (which has not even begun at the time of this review).","woodychandler","Dec 11, 2013"

Ripe orange pungent grapefruit aromas with caramel malt and a sour dough bready aroma beneath. Medium bodied with a smooth oily feel and tight tangy carbonation at the finish. Citrus orange and grapefruit flavors with a spicy tangy hop bite underneath. Intense hop flavors are supported by caramel malt and sour dough bread flavors throughout. Finishes semi-crisply with a pleasant pine hop bitterness. A very good imperil red with intriguing aromas and flavors.   ","IronLover","Nov 27, 2013"

The amazing thing about this beer, and what I think makes it a 'winter warmer' is that it has a rather smooth and sweet mouthfeel with a taste that is not as strong on the (nice and rounded) hops as the aroma. That balance makes it a delight. I recommend you pick this one up before I buy the rest of them.","trentbent","Nov 23, 2013"

Taste all of that, sweat caramel upfront, gives way to a tropical finish. Would like a little more carbonation, maybe a medium body, not really dry, and goes down easily.

Completely different take on a winter ale than what most of the brewers are doing right now. Aroma dank hops, herbal, pine, citrus notes but most notably some type of vegetable be it garlic/onion combo this would make sense. Flavor bready, caramelized sugars, hints of dark roasts but nothing like a real porter or stout just a hint of roasted malt. Big layers of hop bitterness, fresh hop flavors, and dank oily resinous hop oils combine on the palate for one fantastic drinking experience. Mouthfeel has slick hop oils medium bodied with even carbonation a joy on the palate with lingering spicy hop bitterness between each sip. Overall I can't wait to buy another four pack, don't think one 12 ounce "Red Bull" style can will hold you over, great drinking beer perfect for the holidays and Global Warming.","WVbeergeek","Nov 16, 2013"

Very very hoppy throughout, bitter citric rind, lots pine , big bitterness on the back end with a touch of alcohol heat. Bitterness isn't overwhelming but rather refreshing lingering on the mid-palate rather than the back end. Toasty malt character pops it's head up here and there to let you know this is a different beer from bengali and resin. Basically it has that super classic hopped up sicpoint profile with more malt for balance and a touch of complex flavor. I like it but if bengali can be offered in 16oz cans than i think this should come in the same format.","jtierney89","Nov 14, 2013"
