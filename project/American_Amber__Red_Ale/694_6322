Nice light nose of blended hops, mostly pine with herbal notes, over a somewhat dominate caramel base.  As it warms, light spicy hop notes are present.  Light medium bodied with a nice slightly oily texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  Very well balanced flavor profile with a bit of complexity and quite good intensity for an amber ale.  It begins with a blend of hop flavor that transitions to mostly pine as the bitterness begins to creep in.  Beneath all of this, is a good caramel backbone that takes center stage as the mild bitterness releases into the finish. The finish is slightly sweet over a mild pine oriented bitterness with a touch of pepper like spice.","tillmac62","Oct 06, 2014"

Nose is mild and cheerful with gentle citrus, floral hops and a generous, forward malt presence. The malt profile kept expanding as the beer warmed. Hearty bready biscuit, round and toasted, then honey toffee sweetness. It’s slightly whimsical how all that strong malt character gently kisses the bright grassy hops. Taste is perfection. Smooth, light, lively; moderate for all it’s malt backbone. Deeply flavorful. Succulent hops finish dry but not really too bitter with a slick mouth coating and a little pine. This is an enticing amber with plenty of character that you could happily drink all day.","utopiajane","Jun 09, 2013"

Smells of sweet caramel malts and floral/fruity hops. Slight hint of piney hop bitterness, but not much. As the head continues to diminish it leaves tons of lacing. Taste is lots of clean, bready crackery malts, with some sweet fruity hops and a tiny pinch of bitterness at the very end for a nice crisp finish. Awesomely drinkable, another winner from Troegs.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 06, 2013"

Caramel malts in the nose, with a good dose of crisp piney/citrusy hops. Taste was similar, more complex than your typical amber ale, even if nothing surprising going on; bready malts, caramel, nice hop bite with notes of pine and citrus pith, for a good sense of balance. Light-medium body, crisp and enjoyable, and about as spot-on for the style as you can get.","Rifugium","May 18, 2013"

The smell is very nice of malty, caramel aromas. The taste has a very inviting hop bitterness to it, with nice malt chararstics to it. Its mouth feel is really nice and rolls off the tongue really nice. Overall a really drinkable and enjoyable beer.","chefhatt","0"

Tröegs did a great job with this refreshing take on an amber ale. Now that I've tried it, I'll have to seek it out. Yes, most people are drinking wheat beers, saisons, and IPAs during the warmer months, but I honestly think Tröegs Hopback should get consideration, despite its being an amber since it's nice and light and features a refreshingly juicy hop bite. Highly recommended.","hagbergl","Jun 08, 2012"

Aromas of rich caramel malt and a subtle, wet hops to balance. Flavors are resiny hops and dark, sweet, roasted caramel on the forward tongue blended masterfully together. Roasty and smooth throughout. Bitter and slick aftertaste, with a roasty and resiny feel. Great lacing along the glass as you drink. The smooth, rich body leaves a resiny, slightly bitter finish.

The nose felt a little week, especially compared to flavor, though the nose opened up a little as it got warmer. Consider the toasty quality of the malt and refreshingly floral nature of the taste, I'm surprised the nose isn't better. I eally like the mouthfeel on this one, the overall impression I got from it is a little bit less enthusiastic. That said, this is my second beer from Tröegs, and I'm still impressed.

Nice 2 finger head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is a mix of caramel sweetness and fruity hop character. Apples and pears are in the mix along with a hint of citrus tone. The flavor follows suit and is a very enjoyable blend of caramel malt sweetness and fruity hop flavors, same as found in the nose. Medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean with a lingering fruity hop resin on the tongue. Very nice. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, well representing the style in a hop-forward fashion. Highly recommended.","hopfacebrew","Feb 11, 2012"

The caramel is much nicer in the flavor, with a bit of nice spicy hop profile. There is also a nice mild grapefruit citrus note. Mouthfeel is medium-light and is a bit light on carbonation.

It's a good mix of citrus and sugar. The taste is about half the hoppiness of the Nugget Nectar. This is a more standard drinking beer for a more common drinker. Regardless it's still got a good flavor to it and it's a quality Amber Ale for sure. The mouthfeel is carbonated, and medium bodied. Overall I'd prefer the Nugget Nectar but this is a pretty decent alternative.","Knapp85","May 16, 2011"

Perhaps the one I bought wasn't fress as I didn't notice much hop aromas but the taste was a nice blend of hop, spice, pine notes. This tastes like it would be a great beer to pair with seafood or New England style cuisine. I had it with Chinese and it held its own, but I really could picture myself drinking this beer in a rustic raw bar somewhere downing some mussels, clam chowder or oysters with it. Troegs makes another fine product.","bubseymour","May 06, 2011"

Nose was spicy with hops, much more so than in its bottle or draft forms. Mouthfeel was phenomenal - silky smooth and with a slight hops bite on the tongue, giving 'way on the finish to a great caramel sweetness. I never seem to get this level of taste anywhere but from cask beers. Finish was smooth, tasty with a wash of simultaneous bitter and sweet that lingered. Drinkability - out of this world!","woodychandler","Nov 24, 2010"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and subtle bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, and a slight citrus hop note. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice amber ale. Wish I had gotten to try this one fresher, but it still had maintained quite a bit of it hoppy character despite this fact. The flavor was very nicely balanced and the aroma was quite nice as well.

"4.12","+3.8%","4","4.5","4","4","4"," Hopback has subtle fruit flavors which border on stone fruit, but with the simcoe there is more citrus influence. The malt taste is toasted w/ an essence of mild creamy yeast from the cask treatment. The citrus combo with mild munich sweetness is a pleasant juxtoposition w/ more juiciness in the taste than I remember from standard Hopback. the slight caramel comes through more as it warms w/ light tinges of grapefruit and mild lime tinges. The biscuit in the malt is fitting for the style and provides a good backbone for the mild hop w/ only a slight amount of alcohol shining through. A worthy cask ale w/ lots of hop aroma, I think it is solid in its usual format, but the cask with Simcoe hops adds just a little more to the drinkability for me.","Slatetank","Oct 11, 2010"

Somewhat of a hazy appearance on this one but that's to be expected. A big ol fluffy white head with staying power, not to mention nice stickies. Smell is less sweet than normal hopback out of the bottle, or tap for that matter. The extra dry hopping really shows. Scents of tropic fruits with a thimble of maltback sweetners, bready and quite inviting. Hopback is not a very bitter beer to begin with, this version is no different. In taste the sweetness is muted under the additional hopping and Im loving it. I sense a bunch of pineapple and mango, not so much is fresh grapefruit. A dash of that Troegs signature pine and some sweet from the malts in the back. A slight sense of sugar on the tail end. The feel is to die for, it's a smooth criminal, it almost rivals fresh Racer 5 off the firkin or cask. Less than medium with a perfect gliding effect. This is easy drinking it is very easy to drink it all before you know it's gone. Not my favorite beer to begin with but the firkin makes it that much more enjoyable.","BARFLYB","Oct 04, 2010"

This could probably be attributed to a bartender who thinks that no head means perfect pour. Color is amber with a brown haze. Not stunning by any means but to be fair, the generic beer mug was not the ideal vessel. Smelled pretty fresh with an upfront hop nose of flower and pine. Also has a rich sweet malt smell. Taste is just a more beautiful version of the nose. Sweet honey and a healthy dose of floral and spiced hops. Very bold yet balanced flavor. Love it. Mouthfeel is a little creamy and has a good presence on the tongue. Despite the hop bill on this, the finish is nowhere as dry as an IPA making it flavorful and refreshing. Great brew overall.

The hops balance very nicely with the caramel notes from the malt. Not any overly hoppy flavor as the name might imply. This is a very well balanced beer.

I expected a hoppier taste was pleasantly surprised by how mellow the hops actually were. Sure, they're present but the lend a nice sharpness without being overly sour or ham-fisted.

The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has a semi-sweet malt aroma with some earthy hints. The hops lend some citrus and pine resin aromas. The caramel malt gives a solid flavor base, semi-sweet and bready before the hop bitterness and citrus/pine flavors take over. Finishes moderately bitter with just a hint of alcohol warmth. Medium body with a nice soft texture. Just enough carbonation to liven things up. A really nice hoppy amber ale. I imagine fresher the better but my sample was still good.","morimech","Aug 30, 2009"

Pale mahogany to amber red in hue, persistent widespread bubbles visible. Pleasing caramel, toffee and heavy cream in the nose, sweeter hops with a mix of tangy citrus, flowers and tea leaf, there's graininess but no real bite nor bitterness. Medium-bodied, round and foamy carbonation, fills the mouth but without that much weight. Milk chocolate, toffee, caramel accents with a pinch of golden raisin to fig next to the apricot, peach and cherry flavors. More hops, cereal, and grass than in the nose, brings an overall swelling of dryness to it. Orange pekoe tea, more of a tea to wet tobacco edge than floral. Moves at a steady pace, neither slow nor swift. Nicely drinkable but not that thirst slaking.","farrago","Jun 26, 2009"

The flavors are what you would expect based on the nose, Caramel malts come out quickly with a break to the hops which while floral in the nose seem to be spicier here.

Their are some nice citrusy scents in the nose, but is equally balanced by a nice sweet caramal aroma. The taste follows the nose nicely, but with a bit more emphasis on the hops. The sweetness is closer to a honey sweetness than a caramel sweetness, but is delicious all the same. Has a well carbonated mouthfeel, but slides down quite gently.

The flavor is a little more laid back, nice doughy malty-ness and a great resiny, juicy hop profile throughout. It tastes great, but the thing that I really love about this beer is the crisp smooth mouthfeel and the lightness on the palate despite lots and lots of flavor. Very refreshing, too.

This is a small notch below Ithaca Cascazilla and CBH Abijah Rowe IPA as my favorite beer of all time. Too bad there was only 3 in my variety pack.. it's a kick ass beer.

After the first sip I thought this beer was very good, but the hops didn't grab my tongue like I thought they might given the name. While I consider myself somewhat of a hophead, I didn't mind the mild taste and after a few minutes found myself at the bottom of the glass.

An aggressive pour yields an off-white, frothy, thick head, about 1" thick. Its a reddish tinted copper color. I like the apparent hops in the smell, it adds character to a style that sometimes lacks it. The taste is also nice balance between the bitterness of the hops (not overwhelming by any measure) and caramel malt background. Rests easily in your mouth. A well built beer, nothing groundbreaking, but very solid. I wish you could get a beer like this at the ballpark, it seems like it would go well with baseball on a Sunday afternoon.","bhalter8","Beers"

A surprisingly hearty malt flavor at the front, then it is overtaken by the hops. The hops bring on a conglomerant of flavors, from grapefruit, grass, earthiness, and slight saltiness at the end. A very consistant mouthfeel, medium bodied all the way through, with the cleansing sensation of carbonation at the end.

I am an avid hop fan so this is a perfect amber ale for me. Color is clear amber and poured into a pint glass resulted in a gorgeous 1" thick creamy head that stuck around for more than half the glass. Left heavy lacing on the glass. Smell is that of hops (YEAH!!) and caramel malt. Taste is exceptional. WOW, I didn't expect this beer to be so good. This satisfied my hop cravings. Taste of caramel with a backround or citrusy hops. I would almost classify this as an IPA, if the hops was any stronger. Mouthfeel is very smooth and above average. This is the kind of beer I can drink a few of.

These days its hard to find a beer that isn't a hop bomb. This is perfect! Just enough hops to say its hoppy and a great malty backbone. The flavor is wonderfully floral and citric with a nice hint of caramel. There is a nice fruity twang to this. Feel is kinda tingly from the carbonation but overall very smooth.

Based on that description it sounds pretty bad, but it's not because all of the flavors are so muted.

There is nothing here that really grabs my attention. I often feel that mouthfeel is the hardest to give a score to since it is either on or off. I mean if you have a RIS that is super carbonated then well I'd give it a 1, if there's a Light Macro with no carbonation then I'd give it a 1. For me its extremes...the beer either has a good mouthfeel or it doesn't, it is either really poor, where it should be, or it is something totally unexpected that just blows the mind. This one is where it should be. Easy drinking brew, one that I could easily drink all night, given I'm in a hoppy mood. As the weather gets colder it seems I'm more into a porter/stout mood. Still this is one that I'd not hesitate to pick up again. Not bitter like an IPA, really balanced between malt and hops in that aspect, but the taste of the beer is all about hops. Pretty cool beer, like a quasi IPA but without the bitterness. I feel that this one might be one that someone who doesn't like IPAs but likes nicely balanced beers such as browns, ESBs, etc would like.","becktone","Beers"

Flavor has a solid caramel malt base with loads of toasted malt character (crystal malt?). The hops bring herbal and citric notes to the fore in the middle of each sip. There isn't much bitterness here, rather just a good, solid hop profile. Finishes a touch sweet with a little bit of diacetyl. Mouthfeel is really silky, solid, and smooth in the carbonation.

It poured a dark amber that looked like it blended in with some cranberry red. It had a 1 inch head of white foam that quickly receded into a handful of white foamy rings and a few streaks of white lace. It had a mild fruit based aroma that contained caramel malts, a dash of pepper, and few bitter hops. The taste was refreshing with the taste of juicy fruits, toasted malts, splash of pine, hint of caramel, and dry roasted citrus hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a good aftertaste of fruits and piny hops. I had this beer on tap and in bottles before. The draft version is much better than the bottled version.

"4.45","+12.1%","4","4","4.5","4.5","5","Another goodie from TroegsI really could not wait. This one poured a nice light amber color, with the tiniest hint of an orange hue. Deep carbonation came up from the bottom of the glass only to reinforce the large head of white stick and foamy lace that formed on the top. Great retention finally gave way to copious side glass lace and a nice little film across the top. The smell was deeply hopped. Very nice bouquet of floral hops, lots of pine and citrus notes accentuating a typical amber back, nicely malted with large hints of grains. The flavor was so much hoppier then I had thought it would be. There was a huge citrus hop punch from the very first sip and a very nice resin like taste that followed you throughout the session leaving behind a great dry and bitter finish. Great use of the hops here as the typical amber will have more of the malty character, which was still evident in the underlying base here, however the big hop presence not only balanced it well, but pushed it over to the lighter side and gave it much more of a bright feel. Great smooth and light body with ample carbonation led this to be an easy session beer. Overall I had honestly never heard of this one before I got it and it was truly wonderful. This was a great beer and something I would like to see more of, a nice, well rounded amber that could hold its own with a lot of sessionable IPAs. Definitely have to recommend this one.","mikesgroove","Oct 29, 2007"
"4.07","+2.5%","3.5","4","4","4","4.5","A little hazy, and on the darker side of light amber (?) with an off whitte head that dissipates pretty quick but leaves nice lace. Nose is hoppier than expected, and I did expect hop, but the nice herbal, pine, citrus smell is balanced out by a sweet malt scent in the background. It's also a little spicy... maybe some ginger and white pepper. Taste is really nice with a pretty light medium body that is very soft. It really delivers a much more balanced taste tha nthe nose would suggest. Very clean. Great for an all day/session drink.","timtim","Oct 19, 2007"

It was good, but nothing really stood out. Towards the bottom third of the glass I did notice more of the hops in the taste and the sweetness faded some. Creamy cask-conditioned feel to it.

The palate breaks down a bit, with a thin lemon grass tea note cropping up where the flavors should be more well rounded. But that's a quibble, really. There's sharp, substantially carbonated bitterness first off, then some sweeter, nutty malts and a tea-like finish.

I think the brewer must have used whole flower hops to achieve this or something because these hops taste fresh picked.

I would consider the drinkability of this beer very high. If this beer was generally available on tap in Tidewater VA, I would rate it above Yeungling but still below SNPA (my staple beers to ask for).

It had a good body but overall the beer was decent in the bottle probably much better on tap.","Higravity","Aug 29, 2005"

The color is a classic amber with an ample off-white head. The nose powers through with sweet malt and piney hops. the front end reminds of an American IPA, but continues with a more moderate bitterness and a pleasant mild spicy aftertaste. The malt was buttery caramel and it bit nutty as well. The mouthfeel was a bit prickly, though that may have due to drinking it at about 40 degrees. My first thought was "I need to have another". Highly recommended.","farHillsBrewer","Aug 09, 2005"

The body is nice and light making for a refreshing beer. A full flavored beer with a nice mix of hops and malt.

However, the hops takes over for the most part. Bitter hops and a slight grape sweetness is the highlight of the sip. Grapefruits or lemons also come through; overall, very citrussy and piney.

I had the opportunity to have the beer served on-cask. It blew me away. The nose was amazing, in that the hops were present and similar to the bottle or draught version, but they were subdued. The head was light and fluffy and lasted the entire duration of the pint. As this was a cask-conditioned ale, the carbonation was very low, allowing for all the flavor to present itself to the drinker. All the flavors of the Hopback were present but just more balanced. The beer was very smooth in my mouth and actually made me understand the purpose of cask ale.

Mouthfeel is superlative, as a cluster of hops exploded on your tongue. Nice carbonation and medium bodied feel. Taste is a complex amalgam of big hoppiness. Pine and citrus overwhelm the caramel malt, and other hoppy notes emerge throughout the glassful. Extreme hops here, but I was expecting a bit more balance from the malts.

Caramel malt with a bready pale malt foundation is the dominant malt character. Subtle, secondary, sweet cracker like presence. Pink grapefruit hop flavor, along with leafy, tea like hints. Moderate hop bitterness balances the soft male backbone. Lanky body with a lean, overly fluid mouthfeel. Underbaked, doughy biscuit presence augments as the beer breathes.

The flavor is slightly of toasted malt at first, then the hops make a full frontal assault. It is a good clean bitterness. A slightly fruity note is detectable in the background.

The taste is also truly balanced with a trace of the hops adding a bittering quality with the malt waves following blending perfectly to form a hopback amber ale.

The first taste is all citrus hops, but the next taste reveals some buttery malt notes, mixed with a touch of caramel and some brown sugar. There is ample bittering on the finish as well. This tastes more like an IPA than a traditional amber ale. The mouthfeel is full and very enjoyable, with just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability is excellent.

The aroma was very fresh (at first I thought it was because I was at the brewery drinking it, but then realized while I talked to the 2 Troeg brothers that it was the excellent use of fresh quality products). I smelled fresh hops (nature-grass, flowers, citrus and some spice), there was a slight malt aroma to it but I really over looked it due to the great hop aroma. The taste was smooth and well balanced. Soft hops (grass, and flowers) were the prominent flavors that were present, but I noticed hints of sweet malt in the middle of the mild hop flavor, which took over the rest of the flavors till the end. It finished with some mild hop spices left on the tongue and in the throat, but not over powering. This beer was very smooth and very pleasing to the taste buds.

Very malty flavor given the heavy hop aroma with just the right amount of hop bitterness, a very nice blend. Nice bitter aftertaste and smooth mouthfeel. A very drinkable session beer. This beer seemed very Rogue-like, just not quite as hoppy. I was at the Great American Beer Festival in the Pocono's in November 02 and was very dissappointed to hear that Troeg's was discontinuing their ESB, which I thought was a great American micro version of the English classic. They told me that this was to be the replacement and this is my first tasting. Not as good as the ESB in my opinion, but an excellent beer none the less.

"4.42","+11.3%","4","4.5","4.5","4","4.5","If there's one thing that defines the Troeg's beers it's drinkability, and this one is a real charmer! It pours a clear, very deep amber body that's capped by a creamy off-white head. The head drops shortly to a thin creamy surface covering, but maintains it throughout the entire glass and leaves some spotty lace as well. The aroma, however, establishes this beer as something special! Fresh hops burst forth as if you had them cupped in your hands and you could rub them between your fingers releasing the floral, softly grassy, and lightly spicy aromas! Really enticing! The body is medium/light with a very fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor melds a rich caramel maltiness with grassy and floral hop flavors. As it warms in the mouth a gentle sweetness comes forth and accentuates some of the more floral flavors of the hops. It finishes lightly dry with a lingering caramel-laced malt note and a gently spicy hop character. The hop bitterness is well restrained, keeping it quite drinkable (and accessible), and allows for an interplay between the flavors of the sweet malt and hops that's rarely seen! Although the serious hop head may be let down by this beer because of it's moderate bitterness, I think that most beer lovers will find it's ability to combine and balance the malt and hops in such a unique way very interesting and highly enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 05, 2002"
