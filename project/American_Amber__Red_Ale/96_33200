Too residual-worty and with the oddest damn hop mis-balance I've experienced in a while.

The taste has a good balance of flavors too but it seems to have a toasted or burnt quality to it. The mouthfeel is drinkable and about medium bodied.

The nose is mostly pine and citrus, the hops clearly dominating this category, though there is a very faint hint of wheat trying to peek in from behind the clouds. The taste transports that wheat forward a bit, though the hops continue to pump in the piny citrus regardless. Not all that surprising, the body is moderate, the carbonation steady, all leading to a pretty drinkable brew.","TMoney2591","Feb 09, 2010"

A citrus fruit like a tangerine or a clementine, perhaps. The flavor has several characteristics that combine into a pretty damn good beer. Flavors are sweet/sour fruit, sweet maltyness, maple, and hoppy pine. Good sort of tart aftertaste. Nice consistancy and texture and good to sip on.","berserker256","Jan 24, 2010"

"3.83","+1.3%","4.5","4","4","3","3.5","Final thoughts: An interesting take on an Autumn seasonal. They took their original spring Roxy Rolles hoppy Amber and Oktoberfested it up a few notches. Seems to have quite a bit of German malts and hops, and it seems, from what I've read, to be pretty true to what an Oktoberfest used to be as the Germans were the ones that really found a niche with hopping beers. I really enjoy this and I'm glad I found it to add to the Oktoberfest beer lineup. The only complaint I have is that it is a little too sweet for my tastes. But overall a good beer.","jlindros","Oct 11, 2009"

"4.08","+7.9%","4.5","4","4.25","3.5","4","On tap at Not Your Average Joe's in Randolph MA. Brought to me in a standard pint glass. This beer comes out an Amber brown color, that looks similar in color to a melted brown sugar. Has a haze to it, but slight clarity when held up to the light. This beer has a small off white colored head with some of the best lacing I've ever seen on a beer before, it's still at the top of the glass even when you're finished with it. The smell is good. Dominated by the hops which isn't something you'd quite expect from a fall or winter style of beer. Followed by the strong hop smell are some other notes of winter spices, but really just an after essence. The taste is very, very good. Seems to be more of a pine hop than citrus, but likely a bit of both. You can also detect some of the spices, maybe cinnomin and some roasted malt and grain. There is also a sour, or tart type taste that may come from some type of fruit that I couldn't quite put my finger on which brings me to the mouthfeel. It left a dry feeling in your mouth similar to when you bite into an apple that hasn't quite fully ripened yet, it's not bad and still above average because the carbonation level is perfect and there's no alcohol bite at all. This beer is extremely drinkable. Not quite sure how it's considered a winter or fall seasonal, I could certainly drink this all year round. But it's nice to see some hoppy styles come out and join the party in the colder weather.","AndyAvalanche","Oct 09, 2009"

Sad to see jinx go as the autumnal brew but this one holds its own in the lineup. When paired with a hearty chili (or any other meaty and spicy dish) this really opened up and complimented it and also developed an almost chocolate-esq creamy sweetness to the malt.

"3.92","+3.7%","3.5","4","4","3.5","4","This beer poured a dark hazy brown with red highlights and a two-finger head that stuck around for a while. The smell is biscuity malt with a some citrus and floral hops. The taste starts off with some sweet bready malt that gives way almost immediately to hops that shift from citrus to a bit of pininess that clears up by the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some subdued carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, the hops are balanced well. Probably one of the better Magic Hat beers I've had.","TheTrevor","Mar 29, 2009"

While it falls short of excellence, it is very good. I like it quite a bit. In some ways, it reminds me Nugget Nectar and the comparison seems natural. But, that comparison reveals what I'd truly like to see in this beer. A little more body, hops, and alcohol would take Roxy Rolles pretty far.

"4.03","+6.6%","4.5","4","4","4","4","12 ounce bottle, best by March 2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber/brown color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is mostly citrusy and pine hops, along with a bit of biscuity malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some caramel malt I can taste in the brew. Good balance between the malt and hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth, tasty and easy to drink. I'm not a fan of most Magic Hat products that I've tried, but I have to give credit where it's due and this is a good brew that I'd pick up again.

Settles to a good 1/2 inch and eventually a solid 1/4 inch that lasts down to the last sip.. Has a sweet caramel malt and citrus hop aroma along with a touch of coffee. The taste is the same along with a bit of spice, and the sweet caramel malt and citrus hops flavor balance each other quite nicely indeed. I believe I may also detect a hint of clove and banana here too. Very nice! Crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Extremely easy to drink in the way well crafted beers should be.

Poured amber with a reddish/orange tint and a pretty short head that sticsk around as a thin cap and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells malty with a bit of red fruit and then the hit of citrusy hops. Pretty much as billed- a hoppy red ale. The taste as well is quite fruity both from the red ale grain bill and from the citrusy hops. Smooth and slightly grainy and with a gentle but sustained bitterness. This is a little bit different and I find I like this more than I thought I would. I think the cereal grain sweetness and the citrusy hops work pretty well together, giving the beer a bit of candied grapefruit peel flavor and a touch of raspberry like sweetness. Gentle and pleasing, this works well as a winter beer.","Georgiabeer","Dec 08, 2008"

The smell and taste is as if you went to a nursery, grabbed a handful of flowers and stuffed them in your mouth. The hops are so incredibly fresh that it's just indescribable (aside from what I said in the last sentence). It could be the benchmade cigar or it could be the crisp autumn air that arrested the majority of my tastebuds but all I could taste from this one is pure, fresh hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean.

Underneath are the roasted, peaty qualities that make this a characteristic red ale. The hop and orange burst up front makes this an interesting interpretation of the style well worth seeking out. It is not a strong beer, sweet but not cloying, with a mouthfeel that is a touch oily from the hops but quite mild in the aftertaste. This is a good, interesting beer well worth seeking out.

The flavors are similar to the aroma except that malts come out more here and are at the front end giving a biscuit like flavor. The hops really stick out and stay around even after the sip is long gone. The hop flavor is more pine like IMO but seem to have a slightly odd finish but that probably is just me.

Simcoes have this kind of aspriny/hard candy like sweetness that I don't always enjoy but Magic Hat definitely pulls it off. This is just as much an IPA as a red ale in terms of the monstrous hop profile. Pretty bitter, though enjoyably. Nothing too amazing in the mouthfeel, but nice. Smooth at the least. I Could definitely drink a bunch of these. It's not really the most stand-out hoppy red ale - in a store full of IPAs I'd probably go with something else. Nevertheless, its still a solid brew.

This beer does not fall into either catagory, giving a bold pine / citrus hop flavor, substantial bitterness and a strong pine nose. The malts are equally as bold, providing a strong malt, caramel, toffee, bready pillow for the hops without waivering late. Firm and smooth textures keep the beer creamy throughout.

All hops in aroma, grapefruity, and much like 60 minute IPa but earthier aromas too. Taste is strong american IPA with amber earthiness, and it is, dare I say, appraching balanced for a style that insinuates senseless amounts of hoppiness. resinous, tongue-coating fresh hope flavor lingers, and there the balance ends...it lasts a long time, the malt backbone cannot compete with the lingering hop intensity. Moutfheel is very full, but drinability is low for me as I cant have a full one in a single sitting, but it's great for what it is and wonderful to see a more amber-leaning IPA...where else can you go with IPA's anyway, except give the malt a twist? The hops overwhelm the subtle differences of course, but the difference it's there for hop lovers to enjoy...I won't be stocking this, but can recommend it to the few people I know who are crazy about hoppy beers.","Liquids","Feb 25, 2008"

Agree with other reviews that the taste is more of the same, quality amber ale malt with a little sweetness, and just the right amount of finishing hops to give it a unique bitterness.

The beer had about a half inch of dark creamy head with a lot of lacing. The color of the beer is a ruddy dark red with almost an orange hue to it and no little bubbles floating up. Definitely the appearance of a dark red ale. I smell a lot of grapefruity hops coming off this. The taste of the beer is ok. I'm not a huge hop fan though. There's definitely a lot of deep complex flavor to this beer. My first senses are the grapefruit at the top of the tongue. As I hold it in my mouth I can feel the alcohol and carbonation wash that taste away. All thats left is a lightly bitter flavor in my mouth. There seems to be an almost acidic bite to the beer. Its very much a sipping type beer since it seems higher in alcohol than it is. To me this beer is a little overbearing in hops.

Taste is explosive and includes the aforementioned wet cannabis and citrus as well as a strong foundation of sweet and sticky candied malt and a yeast fruitiness in the canned peach, dried apricot range.A fine bubble ale carbonation makes this brew go down very easy and I don't think I will be the first to say"I wish it was a year round offering." or "I hope this beer isn't affected by the hop shortage."

The initial taste was of lots of up-front hop flavor, dissipating to a smooth hop bitterness on the sides and back of the tongue, with a freshly-baked bread aftertaste. The hop bitterness dissipated rather quickly - just in time for another mouthful. Lacing was thick down the side of the glass. Pretty hoppy for a red ale, but very drinkable.

Labeled as a hoppy amber, it delivers as advertised. Seems like it is loaded with Cascade hops (my guess), almost like an IPA with a heavy citrus hop and dry aftertaste. But there are definite malty and nutty undertones that balance out the hops, with some caramel as well, reminding you of its amber foundation. Mouthfeel was surprisingly full and slick, chewy.

"3.48","-7.9%","4","3.5","3.5","3","3.5","It seems that Magic Hat has been in a transitional state over the last few years. They have dropped some of their most well known and best beers (Heart of Darkness, Humble Patience etc) and have been trying out new beers quite often on the public. Considering the fact that Saint Gootz was around last year, and is missing now makes me wonder how long this offering will be around. Anyway, pours a very nice dark amber, with lots of air bubbles and a sturdy white head. Aroma brings on lots of prickly piny hops, with a bit of butterscotch underneath. Taste is big on floral hops, not necessarily oily or resin like, but there presence is definitely there. Doesn't seem to be much malt balance, but the overall hop presence is tasty. Somewhat light considering the hop character in this beer. I would say that this is a sessionable beer for people who are in to hops. It is tough for me to review this one when thinking back on Magic Hat's other long gone offerings (bring them back!), but I guess it is of no use to live in the past. This is a pretty quality beer, with some complexity. A six pack would be a wise investment. Cheers","jamie2dope","Nov 28, 2007"

Mouthfeel is straight up smooth and even with carbonation body weighs easy with a medium body just a touch of stinging acidity in the finish, but hop burps are on the way. Drinkability, it's always nice to see something other than winter warmers during this time of year enough malt and spices give me some friggin' hops, here's enough to hold me over one the beer stock runs low.

As a UVM grad I like to say I'm a big fan of Magic Hat, but this beer is like nothing else they've produced. The taste as just a touch of the apricot/fruit taste that I've come to love, but mostly its a perfect synthesis of bitter hops and full-bodied grains.

Big hops flavors (citrus and flowers) rush in as soon as the first drop hits the taste buds, then back off some to let the very pleasant roasted malt flavor show through (caramel and hay). The hops then rush back in toward the finish (fruit & resin). The finish is long and bitter, citrus and a touch of spice. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. This is another good one from Magic Hat. Ive been in the mood for a hoppier beer as of late, and this one did the trick without being overbearing.

Theres a little pine and fruit, and a slight graininess. None of the flavors particularly stand out as dominant. The beer has a medium body and relatively low carbonation.

The flavor is of pine splashed with watered grapefruit juice leading into a strange metallic and vegetal-like finish. An odd and unpleasant mushy, moldy fruit flavor adheres to the tongue lending a greasy feel. Thin and watery mouthfeel, lacking any body whatsoever, and the carbonation is nearly non-existant.

The palate is well balanced between generous helpings of caramel malts and lemony, zesty hops. Some sweetness crops up just before the finish, which dries out just a tad as it fades. Overall, this is a very good beer -- true to the style, and lacking too much metallic aroma in the hops, which is a nice change from many American reds.

On the tip of the palate, there is a strong fruit presence (maybe grapefruit, but also apricot and mango), followed by a roasted malt taste as it rolls down the back of the throat.

It is not as sweet as the aroma might suggest, or at least there is not enough malt sugars to allow this to taste of sweet citrus fruits. Instead the loud citrus notes take on a citrus like peel character (you know, citrus without the sweetness). The finish has a slight note that tastes like darkly roasted grain to me, but just a hint. Mostly the finish is dominated by a biting hop bitterness that is even a touch astringent at times. This could actually use a bit more of a malt backbone to carry the over-the-top hops. Without the citrus hop notes take on a tartness that does not quite mesh. Still this is quite a drinkable brew, and I will happily finish it.","Gueuzedude","Dec 13, 2006"

"4.17","+10.3%","4","4.5","4","4.5","4","12 oz., best by February. It pours a ruby/mahogany with medium carbonation and three fingers of khaki head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is quite nice, with rich hops that contribute grapefruit, passionfruit, mango and a dash of pine needle. Reminds me very much of Double Simcoe's scent. The flavor profile is quite similar with an addition of the apricot esters which I find in so many of their brews and a medium bitterness from the leafy/green and tropical hops. Once again I am reminded of Double Simcoe and, lo and behold, the website states that it is brewed with Simcoe and Brewer's Gold. The body is medium and drying, with medium carbonation and a medium, smooth finish. One of the better offerings from Magic Hat, and one I probably enjoyed more due to trying Double Simcoe just a few days prior.","mmmbeer","Dec 04, 2006"

It has a intense citrus rind tang to it, with an end of lingering hoppy spice. It could do well to tone back the intensity of the hops, but for what they where aiming for, they nailed it. All around a very good beer, but not an exceptional one.","Saint","Dec 01, 2006"

"4.22","+11.6%","4","4.5","4","4","4.5","Whoah! Magic Hat has done it again! Roxy Rolles... Hoppy Amber Ale... Yes! It pours a reddish chestnut body with orange highlighhts beneath a creamy light tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some very nice, fine lace about the glass. The nose is loaded with resinous, piney, citrusy (orange, grapefruit), and floral hops as well as a hint of the caramelish malt beneath. The body is medium and it gently caresses the tongue with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor reveals even more hops, starting citrusy and gently piney with notes of orange, sweet grapefruit and pineapple, and then becoming much more piney and sappy once it's crossed the palate. Across the middle some mild malt reveals itself with a caramelish and biscuity character. Some other yeasty fruit sneaks in at the swallow, with apple, pear, and berries; and a touch of buttery diacetyl appears in the finish, helping to neutralize the tangy, juicy, and piney hops - leaving the palate refreshed for another sip. It lingers, gently bitter and piney with a gentle smear of butter, for what seems like forever. A very enjoyable ride! Certainly worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 26, 2006"

Hops domination in the flavor, too much for my taste actually; mainly because there's no balance whatsoever. Any malt character is almost nonexistent, and the bitter puckering hop character is way too strict, without any of the preferred flavors I like from very hoppy beers, such as citrus, herbal, spicy stuff. Sadly, I am stuggling to finish this brew. I'm sure some hopheads will enjoy this, but if you like a more complex hoppy beer, seek other choices.","AudioGilz","Nov 22, 2006"

Big aromas of citrus pith (grapefruit and tangerine) ride out atop a caramel-candy sweet malt base. Some pineyness, too. Flavor seems a bit...off: citrus hop flavor appears in a brief flash, then there's a strange smokey and buttery taste, kind of like movie-theater popcorn. A little orange peel flavor toward the finish, then a weird sweet smokiness at the end. Sort of slick mouthfeel, medium body. Decent for a winter seasonal, but this isn't gonna fool anyone into thinking it's in the same league as Celebration and Santa's Private Reserve.","orfeu","Nov 10, 2006"

"3.9","+3.2%","4","4","4","3","4","This is a pretty good stab at a hoppy red ale.

The smell is piney, citrusy, and hoppy, the evergreen notes making it especially fitting for the season. The taste is citrusy hops, fairly strong but not overpowering, with caramel malt, followed by a hop finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good for this moderately hoppy brew. The hoppiness adds a bit of a harshness, but not too much. Overall a good brew, probably one that will be appreciated more in December though.","auntfloyd","Oct 30, 2006"
"3.37","-10.8%","3.5","4","3","3","3.5","Tried this one at a recent party. Poured a lovely dark amber color, with a two finger head. Great head retention, with nice lacing. Aroma was detectable from some distance, assaulting my nose right away with pine and bitter orange peel. When I first opened the bottle, I was instantly reminded of a Noble Fir christmas tree. As for the taste, this one was a bit disappointing. Very hoppy at first with little else to offer after that. Some light citrus notes, but mostly just the hops. Little if any aftertaste. Mouthfeel was quite light. The simple flavor and light mouthfeel make this beer very drinkable, but hardly something to write home about. I've come to expect more from Magic Hat beers, most of which I greatly enjoy.","natehelgeson","Oct 28, 2006"
