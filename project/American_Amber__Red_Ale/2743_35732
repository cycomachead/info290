"3.91","-1.5%","3.75","4","4","3.75","3.75","Pours an amber transparent. Light carbonation. Smells a bit astringent with malty tones.  Taste is an even throughout subtle malt with slight biscuity aftertaste. Taste gets slightly more malty with warming temps. Definite caramel finishing yet still more biscuity in my batch. Enjoyable beer.","Kyseber","Got",

Hop Head Red is still a red, nice amber rust color and sweet caramel malts on the nose and palate, but there is a great (and subtle) hop profile to add balance and complexity.  Really nice.","mtomlins","Mar 22, 2015",
