The only downside to this gem of a beer is that on a clean palate, the finish will start to turn slightly caustic at the end. Otherwise, the flavors, mouthfeel, and smell jive well to form a very delicious brew. One of my favorite red ales, I hope to get some more this coming fall. Now that I go to CSU, hopefully I can get is straight from the brewery!","Bockrules","Apr 14, 2014"

Smells of deep caramelized malt with chocolate and slight floral aroma. Tastes of slight chocolate with nice piney/earthy hop bite. The malt dominates at first, then the hops take over. Beer is carbonated fine and for a light/medium body, it goes down very smooth, could definately see throwing a couple of these back in a short time. Overall, a very good beer.","cyclonece09","Apr 10, 2013"

The beer pours a clear amber with finger and a half froathy slightly off white head that is leaving a lace. The smell is malty with a slight pine hop kick. The taste is a very nicely balanced hoppy red. Starts malty then there is a kick of piney slight citrus hop followed by bittering hops that clean the pallete. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body with decent carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and I could drink the heck out of it.","WoodBrew","Dec 27, 2012"

The nose comprises sweet toffee, sharp pine needle, miscellaneous greens, and light leek. There may or may not be some mint in the background, but I can't tell for sure. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the mint does, in fact, come through in the midst of the pine. The hops clash amongst themselves while also clashing with the toffee. Not sure how they pulled that off, but I'm considering giving some reluctant props... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, I feel the hops and malts just don't cooperate well enough in this beer to allow me to enjoy it. Something like that.","TMoney2591","Nov 10, 2012"

The flavor has these elements but also includes pine and grapefruit pith at a medium-light level, and some light toasted nut flavors join the party as the glass warms up. Its a good interplay between the nuttiness, the toasted bread, and the somewhat higher than usual hopping for an amber (It easily crosses the line into typical PA hopping strength.) Check this one out if you like the notion of mostly herbal hopping on toasted bread malts as the central focus for a sessionable ABV beer.","WastingFreetime","Oct 23, 2012"

The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, caramel, bread, caramel hop, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really wasn’t overly impressed with this one if I am honest. I had heard a lot of good things from other friends that it was one of the best from the style that they had to date. I dunno if I should listen to these people anymore. There were a lot of nice flavors going on here for the style, however, everything just clashed on your palate all at once and there was no chance to ever really recover from it. Hate that was the case. Worth trying at least once, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to do so again.","thagr81us","Oct 02, 2012"

Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, grapefruit, citrus zest, herbal, floral, and pine. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, grapefruit, pine, orange zest, grass, floral, nuttiness, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pine, grapefruit, toast, floral, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Great hop/malt balance; with nice flavor complexity and balance. No cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent amber ale. Great hop and malt profile; and very smooth to drink.

Flavor is initially dominated by the hops; floral and spicy, transitioning to slighly malty sweet and finishes amazingly neutral and clean for a beer with that kind of hop flavor.

This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the flavors did a really great job at holding my attention, I think one bomber would be enough for me, but I wouldn't say two would be impossible. What I liked most about this beer was the great taste and aroma, I really like how the hops contrast the toasted malts. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, the carbonation was a little to high, but that seemed to be the only thing that didn't work that well with this beer. I would buy this beer again, in fact I already went back and got three more bottles before they jacked up the price, I highly recommend this beer to jut about anyone. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it turned out to be the best out of the four bombers released in Michigan by New Belgium and so far it's my favorite Fall seasonal of the year, good job New Belgium, this is one great Fall time beer.","StoutHunter","Sep 12, 2012"

It's like someone took red ale and an IPA and forced them to have a love child. There's also something about the taste that is just really distinct and very delicious. The taste is complex. Bitter at the start, but not too much. Then as it hits the back of the tongue, the sweetness and caramel flavor just comes through. Great beer.","bigpatvoodoodad","Sep 12, 2012"

Tastes are bready, caramely, biscuity, spicy hop, crisp, fresh, and again that pellet hop characteristic, somewhat grassy and fresh. Thinner bodied, god carbonation, finishes clean. Overall, I liked this one, but maybe it could have used another week or 2 in the bottle. I've never had a beer where the hops smell and taste like hop pellets. Not that it's a bad thing, just different. I'll probably pick up another one of these before the season is gone, especially at $3.49 a bomber!","barnzy78","Sep 09, 2012"

A thickly sweet and floral aroma of some caramel, a hint of some coffee, bread, and earthy florals from the dry hops. Taste followed suit; floral and a touch bitter from the hops, the big, thick caramel malt belly offer of a dose of some toffee, coffee, and bread. The more I drink of this the more the sweet syrupy and rather chewy base of this beer does show itself. A full body on this one with enough activity to give it some life but not enough to properly counter the chewiness of it. Right now in the warmth of the closing summer it is a bit too heavy, come fall it might hit the spot. Overall, another nice surprise from New Blegium, though maybe I shouldn't be so surprised at this point as I have enjoyed each of their last 3 seasonals (Dig, Somersault, and now this). This is definitely more of a Fall beer than a late summer beer, as NB claims this to also be. It's heavy and sweet and will go much better with the drop in weather and shortening of the days.","denver10","Sep 02, 2012"

Red Hoptober delivers all of these attributes in spades. Looks red, okay, criteria number one delivered. Smells of pungent pine, pithy citrus and toffee. A strong nose and something New Belgium seems to pull off very well. Sometimes though I feel like NB beer tends to fall short of what the aroma promises flavour wise when it comes to their hop centric beers. Not Red Hoptober.

As stated before I don't like red ales that much, but I do LOVE New Belgium and feel like I often may over-rate their releases. This time I feel I'm being subjectively fair and giving it exactly what it deserves. This is a great beer for the price (6.99-8.99 per 6 pack) and I recommend it for anyone who likes Ales of any type. GOOD STUFF!","Psilo707","Aug 16, 2012"

4.42,17.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The burnt umber colored body was clear, and topped by a two finger thick, foamy, beige head. I could smell the bright hops even before bringing the glass up to the nose. Once I did, the nose was dominated by piney, earthy, spicy, and musty hops. As anticipated, the taste was quite bitter and earthy, with a flash of brown sugar mid palette, and a carbonated, drying, finish. The body felt medium thick, oily, and soft. This is better than the typical New Belgium seasonal, and approaches the quality of the Lips of Faith series.","rajendra82","Aug 10, 2012"

But Red Hoptober seems to bridge the gap nicely, offering some toasted malt and enough crisp hop to battle the ongoing heat as the days, with almost painstakingly slow speed, grow cooler. I can certainly get behind this beer for now. What pains me, though, is it's mid-November best by date. After all, if the weather's course is any indication, that's when Red Hoptober and it's ilk will be truly at their prime.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 06, 2012"

4.4,16.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I was surprised by this beer from the instant I opened and poured it. One, because of its appearance—I wasn’t expecting something with such a rich, deep amber brown hue, and literally two solid fingers of creamy foam topping it. And two, the aroma—oh, what an aroma! From the instant I cracked this open I could smell it. First impressions are of chocolate malt—just this wonderfully bright bouquet of roast and chocolate malt that comes across. It’s pleasing and another surprise. The flavor cracks with a smooth malt like an amber and a defined, distinct bitterness. There’s a pleasing hoppiness that develops and gives this some kick. Not sure where this beer fits in the grand scheme of things—it’s a hoppy amber, or a malty IPA, or just something altogether delicious.","elNopalero","Aug 06, 2012"

And besides, i like reds/ambers to be malty, toasty, and sweet, not bitter and sour like this thing, despite it's name of "Red Hoptober." Their original Hoptober brew last year was phenomenal, this one ... not so much.","JuicesFlowing","Aug 05, 2012"
4.05,7.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The initial taste is of grain husk and toasted malt. Then the citrus hop kicks in all the way through to the finish. I really like the cascade and toasted malt finish. The beer is medium body and has a smooth feel to it. It has good balance between the sweetness and bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable beer. This would be a good Amber or Brown ale on it's own, but the addition of citrus hops kicks it up a notch.","Kromes","Aug 04, 2012"

Hop smell replaced by sweet rich malt while drinking. Taste reminds me of a mildly sweet stout with balanced bitter character. There was a slight alcohol burn on the back end. Thin light lacing was left on glass. Overall impression is of a half stout and half IPA to warm a cool July airconditioned evening.","stonewild","Jul 27, 2012"

Smell is of toasted malt, toasted bread, and some earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight sweetness and a fresh herbal hop flavor. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp yet medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is quite tasty and very easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 20, 2012"
