Finishes light and watery with a grainy aftertaste. Well carbonation. Not much of a fan of the overall flavor and I find the finish to be a bit off.

Definitely a daily pint, this amber ale makes one experience the flavors of the beer without a wicked hangover, and it won't dehydrate like a super-hoppy brew.

I have turned to Fat Tire when needing a sessionable yet flavorful beer. It's a great Amber Ale. Bitterness is balanced quite well with the sweetness. New Belgium knows what they are doing with this beer. It's a common, accepted beer staple in much of the Western States. It's a good balance and easy drinker, way above average adjunct lagers and other mass produced cereal beers. IMO, this brew has it's rightful place. A good quality brew for the craft beer beginner, or one looking for a quality easy drinker without having to sacrifice quality and taste. My first choice when camping in the Rockies around Monarch Pass in Colorado. A twelve pack of bottles amongst a warm camp fire soothes my soul.","Lagerquestrian","Oct 17, 2014"

It's available everywhere, and I'd much rather drink this than a big-company beer, but by now I can do better.

Taste is above average but barely - and it's all over the place. If my future self asks me if I would buy this again, I'd say apprehensively yes, but it will never be a staple in my beer cave. The flavor is too weird and everything else is just out of balance.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 23, 2014"

The first New Belgium beer to hit Alberta (along with Ranger IPA) and not a surprising choice at all considering that this is basically a craft beer legend in terms of broadening the mainstream drinker's horizons and helping to set the stage for the wonderful scenario we enjoy today (i.e, the widespread availability of beer that contains flavor). A coppery red-bronze brew with a moderate amount of whitish head and an aroma centered on biscuity, nutty malts, the overall impression is one of flavorful but not cloying biscuit and pecan nut flavors, supplemented by a little red apple skin and faint strawberry creme and pine flavors ... This latter element must be the hops making their presence known just enough to cut some of the sweetness. Others taste some Belgian influence here. I do not, although I suppose there is a rather more assertive yeast flavor than would be typical for a red ale and a middling rummy candi sugar vibe somewhere in the mix. All in all, its relatively safe, a great showcase for biscuit malt flavors, sweet but not overly so, there's a pleasingly moderate degree of carbonation, and the whole thing is tied together like a room featuring the Dude's rug.","CalgaryFMC","May 07, 2014"

I must admit, however, having been to many countries in Europe, having lived there (Germany), and beer around the states a lot, I hope I've developed an at least ok taste in beer haha. There is something different about Fat Tire. I feel like along with its increasing availability in average cities also comes its unique taste. I am not the biggest fan of amber ales, but this one is smoooth. The biscuit taste stays in my mouth, without any overwhelming bitter taste at all. And it's amazing when you're outside hanging out in the park or playing frisbee, having a bbq, whatever. I am not a sloppy drinker at all and I hate getting too too drunk, but with this beer I'm able to down a sixer in 2 hours n feel SO right!","PanaDeutsch","Mar 26, 2014"

The is a good to very good amber ale, like able, but not outstanding. I read leaddog's review just below mine. He gives a very good and accurate description.

The pour is quite handsome with a nice reddish copper color and a foamy white head that lasts throughout the pour with a little spiderweb of white lacing. The aroma is nearly non existent but what there is is malty and sweet but definitely not deep and complex. The mouthfeel is quite light and easy to sip almost reminiscent of a light lager. The flavor is very unremarkable. A little hop bite and a significant amount of sweet malts. There is a bit if a bready Belgian yeast flavor as well. This is by no means a bad beer and I can understand why people not used to craft beer would enjoy this, but personally I won't be buying this one again.","lochef81","Mar 04, 2014"

It has a wonderful amber color that is very inviting, as should an amber ale, and has very nice clarity as well. It is a good example of an amber ale, thought doesn't have a very strong taste, there is a good balance between flavors with a slight bitterness. It has the good characteristic of being easy to drink yet filling at the same time.","StrictlyB","Feb 10, 2014"

I swear this beer tasted different when I first had it before InBev bought part of New Belgium, more biscuity and malty. This time it's very tart and sweet, with a watery, caramel mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Almost no head but nice lacing. A good go-to amber ale if you can't get any good local brown ale in your area or can't stomach anything but inoffensive flavors. I would call it the white-boy mild salsa of amber ales. Not too malty, not too hoppy, a little watery, but really quite good. Great for finishing off a night or for afternoon session drinking.","bsonk","Dec 03, 2013"

Basically, from what I've heard, Fat Tire is the Boston Lager of the West. A widely available and tasty malt-forward brew. And that's exactly what I got. The aroma is great, there's earthy hops hanging out with some sweeter caramel malts. Balance is really the name of the game all the way around, there's nice sweetness in the middle of this brew, but with a nice, mildly bitter aftertaste that stops it from being cloying. Extremely well-crafted, and one of the best choices for a more traditional (read: not a "red IPA") American Red.","shand","Jul 30, 2013"

Neither really acted to steal the show, but both helped to box out those comparatively unpleasant adjuncts. The nose, comparatively, was weak, but did improve with warmth. This beer is a classic for the style, but its basic nature leaves you searching for a bit more.","TheBrewo","Apr 13, 2013"

The other thing I think Fat Tire has going in it's favor is that it's extremely sessionable.

I expected more out of New Belgium, because I generally like their beers, but the Fat Tire offering that I had reminded me that not every microbrewery can be Sierra Nevada.

Taking my first sip, the carbonation gives way to runny ale seething abt my teeth. I felt provoked to swallow. Taste is OK. Inoffensive. Medium-grade malt flavor with light hop under/overs.

Flavor is sweet with biscuit and slight honey, some chocolate malt, and the tartness from the yeast prevails towards the end of the flavor profile. I'm guessing noble hops are used, as the finish of flavor is nectar and flowery that goes well with the sweet Belgian malt. Well balanced with a middling mouthfeel and a balanced finish.

Many of my long time beer drinking friends and several websites recommended Fat Tire Amber Ale. Boy, was I glad they did. It was an eye-opening experience. I definitely recommend Fat Tire for a beginner beer.","T-Smigs","Jan 01, 2013"

The nose is refreshing, and nice not to get hit with a bag of citrus fruit. The biscuit/bready malt is surprisingly forward. Hops are floral and fruity (and yeast). Taste follows with lots of biscuit/bready sweet Belgium style malt and a bit of caramel. Hops are subdued, but floral and noble in nature. Also fruity yeast character. Mouthfeel is smooth and has good balance. Overall a fine beer, but I prefer SA Lager or Honkers Ale to this.","WoodBrew","Nov 24, 2012"

The aroma is sweet with malts with a touch of caramel. The taste is a delicious toasted malt and spice blend. Though it’s list as an amber ale, it has more spice taste then some companies Oktoberfest offering. It finishes with a slight chalky after taste. I’ve had this in my cooler for about 6 months and I think it drinks a little nicer now that it did when it’s fresh off the truck. A highly drinkable and highly enjoyable amber brew.","Lemke10","Nov 01, 2012"

The smell of the beer is malty, some caramel and some additional grains on the nose. The flavor of the beer is toasted, with a subtle caramel sweetness in there. The bitterness is rather mellow and not piney or resin like at all. The mouthfeel of the beer is very smooth, the carbonation is minimal but yet still there enough to tingle a little. Overall I found this to be a really nice beer, I wouldn't mind having it again. It's sessionable in my opinion. Very easy going brew.","Knapp85","Sep 14, 2012"

I really enjoy this taste, it's surprisingly toasty and malty for an amber ale. Certainly something different. It's light bodied and has low carbonation, it can pass for a session beer. I'm glad this beer came to the east coast lately, it's tasty and it's nice to have it as an option at a lot of restaurants that have no other craft beers on tap.","dontpanic5","Sep 06, 2012"

It's popularity has allowed New Belgium to do unique and different things with beer, and for that I'm grateful but, I'll be honest; I really don't care for this beer. I strive to be as objective and style-focused as possible when reviewing beer; in the end, I just don't think Fat Tire is very good. The combination of malt and hops in this beer doesn't showcase either of the two ingredients, rather, it leaves a lasting impression of just plain "earthy". It's damn consistent though, and that takes some serious skill. If people didn't like it, New Belgium wouldn't be where they are today.","BeerFMAndy","Jul 31, 2012"

"3.75","+4.5%","4","4","3.5","3.5","4","Pours an solid amber with a good amount of white head with good retention that drifts to webbing. The nose is refreshing, and nice not to get hit with a bag of citrus fruit. The biscuit/bready malt is surprisingly forward. Hops are floral and fruity (and yeast). Taste follows with lots of biscuit/bready malt and a bit of caramel. Hops are subdued, but floral and noble in nature. Also fruity yeast character. Mouthfeel is smooth and has good balance. Overall a fine beer, but it seems to be trying to break the mold for an American Amber.","IllNate","Jul 22, 2012"

Fat Tire was never my favorite due to the high maltiness and thinned body, but it is still a well made beer. It has all the right things going for it to be a well-received beer everywhere, and I take up the chance to drink one when offered. It may not be a personal favorite of mine, but it's earned my respect with its consistent recipe in the long run. Being one of the big success stories of craft beer, I recommend any fans of amber ales to try it!","magictacosinus","Feb 13, 2012"

I'd say this one veers just too far off the sweet deep end for me. Medium bodied with some syrupy creaminess to it. I think this beer is a perfectly solid amber and it deserves its widespread popularity but, for me, I am not a huge fan of it as I find it to be just a little too sweet for my tastes. Once a year I can have a bottle of this and it will hit the spot, but once that bottle goes down I need about a years off from it before I can enjoy another.","denver10","Feb 04, 2012"

He had this beer numerous times on tap while traveling and always raved about it. When they started selling it in North Carolina, he was really excited. After buying it a couple times, he was disappointed. He swears that the Fat Tire he enjoyed while in Colorado is very different than the bottled version he buys at home. I should mention that he brews his own beer (and has for about 20 years) and knows difference when he tastes it.","deadonhisfeet","Dec 06, 2011"

Nothing distinctly jumps out. Mild bitter finish, and acidic feel, that balances out the faint sweet malt taste that starts it. Mouthfeel is what would be expected- light, not too dry, smooth. I feel like this beer works well as an introduction to craft beers and one to come back to for something easy drinking that is a good step up from generic big beer companies.","ely2000k","Dec 01, 2011"

Bought a bomber for $3.50. Pours a mahogany brown, nice nutty smell to it. Taste is light to medium bodied, pretty typical amber ale for the most part, but has a very noticeable nutty kick to it which adds a pleasant taste. Very drinkable and a great session beer, The bomber went down easy and smooth and could definitely see this as an easy choice for a no frills, above average beer.","oriolesfan4","Nov 27, 2011"

Barely any lacing throughout the beer, and the head has already completely dissipated. The body is a light amber/orange color, it looks exactly like apple juice looks, for sure lighter in color than a traditional amber ale. Visibility is better than it should be, there really isn't much obstructing my view at all. The carbonation is extremely small, like, ridiculously small, there aren't more than two or three bubbles coming up at one time. Overall the appearance is ok, it's only redeeming factor is...it looks like beer. Small amount of hops on the smell, barely any at all, mostly pale malts here. I knew this wasn't a great amber ale, but this is kinda embarrassing on the smell. I really don't get much in the way of hops at all, and it just smells watery. I mean not much else to talk about, small amount of hops, mostly malt, watery. Overall average smell. The taste is no different, bad malts on the taste and a very very small hop note, somewhat watery as well. I suppose the taste is a little better than I thought it would be, but not by much. I mean the smell was really bad (considering it's a micro brew), and the flavor is only kinda bad. I mean I can at least taste the hops without trying too hard searching for them, where as in the smell it was reaaal difficult. This beer is closer to a 3.5 on the taste, but really not nearly close enough to get a 3.5, still a pretty solid 3. Pretty average taste overall, watery, malty, slightly hoppy, but not much. Mouthfeel is pretty terrible, I gave this beer a little hope with the carbonation, thinking maybe my eyes were deceiving me, but no, almost no carbonation in this beer. It feels like I'm drinking beer flavored water, so little carbonation it's not even funny. I know it's not good to overdo it on the carbonation, but they under did it, BIG time. The body isn't saving the mouthfeel either, it's thin, watery and not much too it. Overall on the mouthfeel...wow, not good. Drinkability is this beers only redeeming factor, it goes down easy and there isn't anything too offensive about it. Overall on this beer, it's a lot worse than I remember it, a lot less flavor and the mouthfeel is a lot worse than I remember. It's not a horrible beer, it's not hard to drink and it doesn't taste horrible, it's just really not a well crafted beer.

The taste of this beer is a nice balance of toasted malt, biscuit, and hop bitterness. Did I mention Sweet. Yes, It's sweet. I have had scores of American Amber Ale's and this by far is the best.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not really a major infraction. This is something of a icon here in Colorado; therefore, at any major event here there's a good chance this will be available to save you from the usual macros you'd be forced to endure.

From notes -- Appearanace: Russet amber that glimmers in the glass. Lots of bubbles that rise to a thin off-white head. Aroma: Toast and homemade popcorn. Taste: Toasty, malty, firm biscuit presence leads into a mild warm hop statement, and finishes with a bitter snap. Lovely! Palate: Goes down smooth, jovially, agreeably, and maltily. Overall: A great, well-balanced brew with a malt-foot forward. Easy, extroverted, not too complex but not at all boring!

One inch of solid head forms and has good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Still not a fan of the aroma or flavor. But it has nice qualities. Definately on the malty side of the beer spectrum. Has a bready and slightly musty quality. Not much for hop aroma or flavor. It is a lighter beer with low ABV, so the body has enough heft and has a nice texture.

There's some toasty malts and then the grassy funk apparent in the smell appears. Finish is a bit on the grainy side. It doesn't look like it in the glass, but explodes with carbonation once it hits your mouth. I do like the feel of this.

The hoppy flavor that it claims to have is recognizable yet subtle enough to keep from detracting from the flavors that it boasts. It is far less malty than some abmbers I have tried but I feel that helps more than hurts the brew.

The taste is so malty and creamy that these flavors remain consistent throughout anything you taste afterwards. There is a distinct sweet aftertaste, pretty much candy, inside of that friggin' bouncy castle, inside of that bottle. Overall, all your worries come back at the bottom of the glass.

The hops are leafy and mildly bitter, and the body is medium and dry. Pleasant and easy-to-drink - nice to see a malt-centered amber ale in the American arena of hopheads.","mmmbeer","Mar 08, 2010"

It gave me a brief amount of head but then transitioned to a small amount of lacing with steady stream of carbonation. I like the flavor. Not sure if I tasted biscuits as some comment.

"3.18","-11.4%","4","3.5","3","2","3.5","Pours a kind of dark copper color, very clear, with a nice dense off-white head that sits around for a while. There's some decent lacing, nothing amazing, but this one looks nice. The smell is sort of subdued, but there's a crackery, kind of toasted bread type smell in there. A tiny bit of sweetness, some light esters, and some kind of chalky, grassy hops in the background. The taste comes across mostly with the toasted bread taste - not burnt you know, but lightly toasted. It's kind of sticky, and I can actually notice the presence of esters here. That sort of subtracts from the flavor that's present. The hops don't come across with a lot of flavor, but really come with a little bit of a feeling - not bitter, but just like a kind of hoppy mouthfeel or something. The malt can get kind of powdery and overbearing at times, almost making it taste dry when it's really kind of sweet. There's a kind of funny yeasty taste, too, but overall, it's fairly pleasant, and though there's nothing to wow you in here, it's not bad at all. The mouthfeel is kind of off though. The carbonation is nice, but somewhere between the huge amount of biscuit malt, the funny feeling from the hops, and the esters mixed in here, the feeling of the beer gets to be kind of off-putting. But overall, you can drink it fairly easily. The price is pretty good for a 22oz bottle, but I wouldn't say I would go after this again, but it was nice to visit once.","taylorhamrick","Jul 14, 2009"

The taste has a nice rich malty taste that is hardy, there is a bit of hops to keep the malts in line though the malts are clearly the star of the show. Flat out a nice session beer for when you do not want anything that complex; just a simple solid non-challanging ale. a perfect beer for smoking a joint, mowing the lawn, a lazy afternoon, a concert.

I think this beer would be much better if it had a bit more malt for sweetness. No doubt, this is a very easy drink and tasted quite fresh. I can't believe its abv is as high as it is.

This beer for being as "dark" as it is, is really super super drinkable and has plenty of flavor.

Very light and transparent zinc orange color, just about as much yellow as any deeper red. Mocha, chocolate cake start off the nose, then corn syrup, dried tea leaves, the lack of a strong roast cedes more territory to the grainy and floral hops elements, almost by default, no citrus. Light-bodied and at times the carbonation foams up enough to make it feel dilute. Malted milk balls, caramel, some biscuit or baguette type of doughiness, here you get a suggestion of sweet mixed white citrus and pine. That said, the floral side drops off a lot even as the corn, raw wheat keep going. Even more watery at the finish, no lift nor final kick.","farrago","Mar 11, 2009"

As a result, I tend to judge everything else by a "fat tire standard". I try not to, but it's hard to break old habits. In any case, now that I have other REALLY good beers to drink, I tend to think of fat tire as distinctly average. It's not bad, and I'll certainly drink it when it's the best available. There are a couple of clubs in the area that serve fat tire on tap, and they just don't have anything better. In that case, it's a nice beer to drink for the evening. Appearance, smell, taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability are all average. Certainly it beats any of the macros, and at times, if I've not had any other beers for a few days, I can honestly say I enjoy the flavor.

It tastes like toasted malt, biscuit, peppery spice, ginger, nuts and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and has average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and it's easy to drink. Not a bad choice as an occasional session beer, either.

Most restaurants carry this as a micro-brew alternative, but I found it rather uninteresting. It has a nice copper color, but the head was flat, as was the aroma. There was a bit of initial bite from the carbonation and some hoppy attributes, but overall I'd rate it an escape hatch rather than something to seek out. If you're looking for a decent American amber ale, hunt down Otter Creek Copper or Lagunitas Censored.","gfreed","Jun 26, 2008"

Compared to many of the exotics from Belgium and other American microbreweries Fat Tire really isnt that impressive, but it is a clean crisp refreshing ale that you can drink all day any day and never get sick of. The flavor isnt overpowering, just a light sweet combination of malt, spices and hops. One of my biggest torments in life is that NB isnt sold in New Jersey, and isnt likely to be any time soon.

I don't know if it's my odd senses or if there is some soured Lactose put in the wort. I find it so dominating that the soured milk smell overwhelms everything else. The taste is much the same, but its not as dominating. There are also roasted grains, and a bit of sweet chocolate that comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller than I expected for the style, which I found enjoyable.

Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a medium amber, forming a thick 1 inch off-white head, leaving a good amount of light lacing. The smell is a light aroma of sweet malt, giving it a light nutty aroma. The taste starts off with a good amount of sweet malts up front, followed by the same light nutty/buttery flavor, and finishing with a hint of hops. Relatively light mouthfeel. For a sessionable ale, this hits the spot. Good flavor and alcohol level. Overall, as stated before, I'm not sure if I've changed or if th ebrewery has, but this isnt nearly as bad as I used to think. I will definitely try this again to confirm.","beeragent","May 02, 2008"

Hoppy bitterness is kept to a minimum, but still can be detected in the background. Aftertaste is heavy, and lingers for a while.

I'm working on it . . . but NB Fat Tire is one of the few microbrews 1) available and 2) on sale. Othewise, stick with Bud Select or Michelob Ultra or the sorry "local" Empyrean (caveat: yes, the Empy's ESB is good). Anyhow, false advertising on the part of NB, for the much proclaimed "balanced" Fat Tire is actually quite malty and hardly, scarcely hoppy. It's a yummy malty bonanza, one you'd love to have with an acidic, teeth-cleaning dinner such as sashimi or grilled fish and lemon. But there's no hop profile to talk of . . . I'd say this beer is closer to the maibock, maltorama beer profile than it is an amber. Great . . . if that's what you're looking for. If you are looking for balance, or a spring and summer drinking sprint, or a mouth-awakener, then this is not the beer for you. As for the NB wheat, well, that's just not worthy of my radar.

Buttery toasted biscuit flavor and plenty of malt sweetness on the front. Texture and taste slides to a grainy flavor in the middle. There's just the right amount of hop bitterness to contrast the malty sweetness. It's perfectly balanced in that aspect. Finish has almost a slight nuttiness to it with alcoholic vapors.

Upon pouring out the first glass I was pretty pleased with the color and appearance of the beer. The smell was on the fruity side and overall pretty pleasing. I thought the beer was very good at first, a somewhat light mouthfeel, but the taste had some nice estery notes hidden in there. Unfortunately, I found that 22oz of this is just too much and was really starting to wish I had split the bomber with a friend then have it all to myself. Hard to really explain why, just found the more I drank of it, the more tired of it I got. It isn't a bad beer by any means, but for all the hype it has gotten for years from people I know, it sure fell far short of living up to it.

MY first impression based upon looks was that it's a fancy ale. Drink with your pinkie up! The aroma was a combination of citrus and hazelnut, and tasted the same. Tried as I might, I couldn't detect much more in terms of flavor.The flavor wasn't full bodied, however, and I found this beer kind of weak. Slight hoppiness, but nothing distinctive. The carbonation was very noticeable. It didn't get much sweetness, but did notice a crispness that remained throughout drinking it.

Palate is on the sweeter side; a good balance of sweet malts and bittering hops. This beer has a candy-like character to it that's nice as well ... like a toffee.

Much the same can be said of the flavor, rather dry for the style, and more in a disappointingly bland way than a pleasantly drinkable one.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers in that this is a good beer when fresh. The nose is appealing with an exagerated malt aroma and a bit of toasted marshmallow; which gets me thinking of this as a great campfire beer. As very carbonated beer, I give my second pour of the bomber a good pour to release the bubbles, creating a very smooth mouthfeel and lasting head bright white foam. A medium bodied beer, Fat Tire is amber ale that accents its malt flavors more than the hops. This is definitely a beer for "malt heads" but not so much as to put off the newbie micro drinker. Definitely a good "beginners" craft beer with enough tasty toasted and caramelly maltiness to make this experience satisfactory, but a little too malty-sweet for me to enjoy more than a couple.","marcobrau","May 14, 2006"

Doughy malts provided the majority of nose, along with a hint of carmel and and another, unidentified, underlying graininess. The beer, which has a substantial following behind it, tasted of a simple maltiness. No hoppiness to really boast of existed inside the flavor, but no negative astringencies were held within there. I found it - on the whole - to be a fairly basic, although very drinkable, amber ale. I see the reasoning behind its cult following, but I find nothing worth really writing home for in this one.

Toasty biscuit drenched in caramel gives it a sweetness that is well balanced by a soft earthy hop bitterness. Some yeasty breadiness adds a nice touch. Very pleasant tasting and well balanced.

It's an enjoyable, well-rounded, and drinkable ale that makes a great introductory beer for your friends who are used to American adjunct lagers and the golden "pilsners" from Canada, Mexico, and Europe; and it pairs well with a wide variety of foods such as grilled chicken, pasta primavera, soft-flavored semi-hard cheese (Fontina, Muenster, etc.), and French toast and eggs.","NeroFiddled","May 14, 2005"

The initial contact with the beer to the tongue is very refreshing, with the bitterness and the malts rushing on as you swallow, and these melt away to leave a tiny trace of the alcohol.

I smell a faint biscut aroma, not much other than that, no hoppy smell to speak of. The taste is even worse, tastes like Coors Lite with a little more malty flavor too it. Mouthfeel was just plain flat, no pep to it at all. As I said before I am not a huge fan of ambers but when I do drink them I prefer one that is either more malty or more hoppy.

Aroma is a soft chocolate scent with a twinge of tangy hops - mouthwatering. Taste is similar yet more varied, featuring a crisp hoppy start that is immediately accompanied by a rich chocolately malt, and finishes with the original dry-bitter (yet slightly fruity, apples and such) hoppiness.

To tell you the truth, the smell reminds me of beef & vegetable stew w/ biscuits. Kinda odd to me! However, when taking a sip, I notice what I smelled is exactly what I taste. The grainy malts and the biscuits and vegetables comes out right away. I never knew beer could taste like dinner...hell, i thought it was dinner!

I have fond memories from a stay in Santa Fe in 1999 -- at the time I loved the beer, thought it one of the best I'd had up to that point. But afterwards I went back to the east coast for a few years, where New Belgium doesn't distribute, and my affection for the beer may have grown as a result of its absence. Now I live in Oregon, and the beer is readily available at every Safeway and 7-11. Fat Tire is back in my life once again.... It's a disappointment. I am hoping the beer has changed over the years, because it's kind of distressing to learn my memory is so unreliable. But Fat Tire is not a BAD beer, and although it cannot live up to its regional hype, it will satisfy many. It isn't a hoppy beer by any means, and is quite smooth, even lager-like. Drinkability is very high. The aroma is not inviting, a bit like sour fruit, but it is pretty mild and can be overlooked. Those who love this beer tend to drink it out of the bottle anyway. The flavor is similarly mild, almost bland, with a subtle caramel roastiness and a strong flavor of peanuts. It's a decent beer, nothing great, but it seems to generate a huge amount of devotion.

The taste matched the nose closely, opening up with bready grassy sweet malts with a touch of herbal spice in the transition to a nice orange-tinged crisper and lightly bittered finish...obvious Belgain pale elements..

A mild bite of hops fills in the middle before the bready sweetness engulfs it once more. Mouthfeel is a little thin but o.k. for the style.

The appearance is copper with a small crest of foam; some lacing; bouquet is mild hops, malt and yeast; the initial sweetness that tempts one to drink more is betrayed by a flat, uninteresting middle.

Light sweet taste with a cracker-bread bite to it. This is a good example of a beer with biscuity cracker flavor in it. A slight hint of some off putting taste, but this fades quickly. No real hop presence to speak of. This is a fairly bland beer from a brewery that so much good beer has come from. Oh well at least it allows NBB to make other great beers.

Lots of malt in the flavor, toasted, biscuit-like, bready, and grainy. Hops are there, but stay subtly in the background. A bit of spicy dried fruit gives complexity and a Belgian feel to this brew. The carbonation creates a Belgian-like mouthfeel as well. Light to medium body. This beer is overrated by the general public, but it's still pretty good. Great session beer. It's also good for converting macroswillers.","hyuga","Nov 13, 2002"

The real charm of the bear is its whistle-clean profile. Subtle in an English Amber way. The substance shows on the lengthy, balanced finish. Highly drinkable. A banger.","putnam","Nov 03, 2002"

First sip reveals big maltiness with caramel flavors.  It is not as hoppy as other amber ales.  A light and refreshing beer.  I'm not able to detect much from the smell.  Since I can't get this beer where I live, the allure is a bit brighter.  I might become bored with it if were much more available.","mjohn27603","Nov 01, 2002"

"4.03","+12.3%","4.5","4","4","4","4","Draft at the Tap Room in Vail, CO. My first experience with the much heralded fat tire came this past weekend. Nice clear copper color, faint white head, carbonation bubbles last and last. Smell was an interesting combination of malty richness, very slight hoppy undertones, and an uncertain earthiness. Taste was crisp and pleasant to start, nice carmel malts, then again a unique earthiness to finish. Tastes coated and lingered on the tongue. I guess I expected a more noticable hop profile, but it still was very good. Lived up to the hype for me. I wish it was available on the East Coast.","StevieW","Oct 07, 2002"
"3.93","+9.5%","3.5","3","4.5","4","4","Overall I like this brew quite a bit.  Pours a clear pale yellow/amber with a 2-finger off-white head that dissipates quickly yet leaves a lace.  The smell is that of a nutty malt with some earthy notes as well.  Light bodied mouthfeel with a smooth well balanced flavor of a slight grainy, touch of caramel flavor, and finishes with a pecan type flavor on the tail.  Highly drinkable.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Sep 17, 2002"

Awesome orange color and foamy white head with a delicate malt aroma, the first taste of this brew is absolute quality. The light sharp hop presence and delicate malt flavor is followed by a crisp clean finish.  Awesome.","beernut7","Aug 27, 2002"

"3.73","+3.9%","3.5","3","4","4","4","Fat Tire poured a nice amber tint with minimal head retention and decent lace. It didn't smell incredible, nor did it smell too bad. The taste was somewhat sweet, with some lingering caramel and toffee flavors. It is very balanced and it's quite easy to put away more than a few of these. Overall, this is a pretty good amber that seems to be rather overrated among the average beer drinkers. Cheers to New Belgium, however, on their excellent bottle labels, which are great marketing tools in themselves.","Jon","Aug 13, 2002"
"4.05","+12.8%","4","4","4","3.5","4.5","Tawny-gold hue, ultra translucent, small off-white head, peaks at a half finger before fading slowly, a few rings of lace. Lovely, delicate nose nutty, fruity with a whisper of spice and malt. The invitation is soft yet you gladly take a sip. Tasty palate, nutty, crisp malty influence, nicely spicy, some fruitiness. Again the palate is soft but pleasant with just enough of a malty aftertaste to be reminded to drink it again. The body is medium-light, moderate carbonation, fair mouthfeel. Damn drinkable. This is the worlds greatest crossover beer and one hell of a session beer for any BA. The beer is not the second coming, ignore the hype and enjoy Fat Tire for what it is a great Amber Ale.","bditty187","Jul 11, 2002"

"3.64","+1.4%","3","4","3.5","3","4","Once again, the new belgium company has made an good beer. While this is not one of their best, it is the most readily available. It pours a dark amber, almost red color, and has a medium light colored head, which fades quite fast. The is a nice floral/fruit scent to the beer. This is also noticed in the first sip. This is a very smooth beer, with a malty sweetness, and is very easy to drink. I find this beer to be alot better than other ones silimar (i.e. Shiner Bock). On a side note, the beer tastes just as good directly from the bottle, which makes this a nice choice to take to parties, or out on the lake. All in all this is a good beer to keep on hand if you just want to kick back with some friends and drink a few beers","usualpulp","Jun 19, 2002"

You have to hunt for an aroma, but the beer produces an enjoyable, mildly malty finish.  No characteristics stand out as particularly notable.  Still, its a worthy tavern-food companion.","Suds","May 12, 2002"
"3.53","-1.7%","4","3.5","3.5","3.5","3.5","The clear light amber hued brew is topped by a fairly thick head that exhibits good retention.  Fat Tire is well carbonated, but the CO2 levels still manage to allow for a smooth mouthfeel and medium body. There's just a touch of yeasty esters in the aroma along with a discernable biscuit malt aroma (bread and butter!) The hop bitterness is quite mild and appropriate considering that Fat Tire isn't heavy maltwise. Hop flavor is almost nonexistant, although I do detect a hint of earthy hop-- perhaps Willamette or Styrian Goldings?  In any case this is an innocuous, no frills beer.  Well balanced all around-- an excellent session brew.  This may actually be better in the bottle than on draft.","marc77","Apr 04, 2002"
