I'd definitely buy this again, but won't seek it out.","SaltofOH","Yesterday at 05:34 PM"

Finishes light and watery with a grainy aftertaste. Well carbonation. Not much of a fan of the overall flavor and I find the finish to be a bit off.

It's a great Amber Ale. Bitterness is balanced quite well with the sweetness. New Belgium knows what they are doing with this beer. It's a common, accepted beer staple in much of the Western States. It's a good balance and easy drinker, way above average adjunct lagers and other mass produced cereal beers. IMO, this brew has it's rightful place. A good quality brew for the craft beer beginner, or one looking for a quality easy drinker without having to sacrifice quality and taste. My first choice when camping in the Rockies around Monarch Pass in Colorado. A twelve pack of bottles amongst a warm camp fire soothes my soul.","Lagerquestrian","Oct 17, 2014"

3.69,2.8,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Bottle from a six-pack poured into a shaker pint glass. The first New Belgium beer to hit Alberta (along with Ranger IPA) and not a surprising choice at all considering that this is basically a craft beer legend in terms of broadening the mainstream drinker's horizons and helping to set the stage for the wonderful scenario we enjoy today (i.e, the widespread availability of beer that contains flavor). A coppery red-bronze brew with a moderate amount of whitish head and an aroma centered on biscuity, nutty malts, the overall impression is one of flavorful but not cloying biscuit and pecan nut flavors, supplemented by a little red apple skin and faint strawberry creme and pine flavors ... This latter element must be the hops making their presence known just enough to cut some of the sweetness. Others taste some Belgian influence here. I do not, although I suppose there is a rather more assertive yeast flavor than would be typical for a red ale and a middling rummy candi sugar vibe somewhere in the mix. All in all, its relatively safe, a great showcase for biscuit malt flavors, sweet but not overly so, there's a pleasingly moderate degree of carbonation, and the whole thing is tied together like a room featuring the Dude's rug.","CalgaryFMC","May 07, 2014"

Not the most unique example of the style, but this particular brew has a lot of history behind it and is a damn fine ale regardless. Marzen fans should find this one an agreeable year-round alternative, and anyone seeking out a reliable, lighter ale that keeps the hop bill in check should give this bike a test run. I'd pick this one up again.","thehyperduck","Apr 23, 2014"

I must admit, however, having been to many countries in Europe, having lived there (Germany), and beer around the states a lot, I hope I've developed an at least ok taste in beer haha. There is something different about Fat Tire. I feel like along with its increasing availability in average cities also comes its unique taste. I am not the biggest fan of amber ales, but this one is smoooth. The biscuit taste stays in my mouth, without any overwhelming bitter taste at all. And it's amazing when you're outside hanging out in the park or playing frisbee, having a bbq, whatever. I am not a sloppy drinker at all and I hate getting too too drunk, but with this beer I'm able to down a sixer in 2 hours n feel SO right!","PanaDeutsch","Mar 26, 2014"

Aroma is faint--malt, hops, a little sweetness. Flavor is mild--balanced, nicely balanced malt and hops. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, with moderate carbonation. The is a good to very good amber ale, like able, but not outstanding. I read leaddog's review just below mine. He gives a very good and accurate description.

The pour is quite handsome with a nice reddish copper color and a foamy white head that lasts throughout the pour with a little spiderweb of white lacing. The aroma is nearly non existent but what there is is malty and sweet but definitely not deep and complex. The mouthfeel is quite light and easy to sip almost reminiscent of a light lager. The flavor is very unremarkable. A little hop bite and a significant amount of sweet malts. There is a bit if a bready Belgian yeast flavor as well. This is by no means a bad beer and I can understand why people not used to craft beer would enjoy this, but personally I won't be buying this one again.","lochef81","Mar 04, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear pale orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, light citrus, light pepper, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of caramel/toasted malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, light citrus, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight herbal/pepper bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, light citrus/pepper, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Well balanced flavors of caramel/toasted malts and moderate herbal/earthy hop flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this a good amber ale style. Balanced caramel/toasted malt and earthy hop flavors with solid robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

Smells of sweet caramel from the malt bill with no indication of hops whatsoever. Taste is fairly faint caramel with a little sweet molasses. No hint of hops whatsoever. Taste is actually better than expected. I like it more than I had in the past. Not used to low ABV beers. Mouthfeel is thin as it should be. Overall not al bad beer.

I swear this beer tasted different when I first had it before InBev bought part of New Belgium, more biscuity and malty. This time it's very tart and sweet, with a watery, caramel mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Almost no head but nice lacing. A good go-to amber ale if you can't get any good local brown ale in your area or can't stomach anything but inoffensive flavors. I would call it the white-boy mild salsa of amber ales. Not too malty, not too hoppy, a little watery, but really quite good. Great for finishing off a night or for afternoon session drinking.","bsonk","Dec 03, 2013"

In the past I have paired it with a sidekick of orange cognac and the two play off each other quite well - it is a great chocolate/orange combo.","I3eck","Oct 04, 2013"

It's just a good, crisp, drinkable ale, suitable for tailgating at a football game, doing yard work, or just sitting at the house watching T.V.

Basically, from what I've heard, Fat Tire is the Boston Lager of the West. A widely available and tasty malt-forward brew. And that's exactly what I got. The aroma is great, there's earthy hops hanging out with some sweeter caramel malts. Balance is really the name of the game all the way around, there's nice sweetness in the middle of this brew, but with a nice, mildly bitter aftertaste that stops it from being cloying. Extremely well-crafted, and one of the best choices for a more traditional (read: not a "red IPA") American Red.","shand","Jul 30, 2013"

From the bottle it lacks that creamy, frothy mouthfeel. I’m guessing there’s something to be said about the can vs. bottle, especially if the beer is can-conditioned, because that oomph is completely missing in the bottled pour.","elNopalero","Jun 23, 2013"

The beer smells like toffee and bread crust. It also smells a little nutty. The taste follows the nose. It's a mild flavored beer with slight toffee and nice bread crust flavor. There's a touch of nuttiness as well. The body is light with moderate carbonation. There's a light aftertaste and this beer is highly drinkable. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Apr 12, 2013"

The appearance has a pleasant golden amber hue. Inoffensive, but nice enough to look at. Nose was lacking. Malt, I suppose? This is a beer, correct? Taking my first sip, the carbonation gives way to runny ale seething abt my teeth. I felt provoked to swallow. Taste is OK. Inoffensive. Medium-grade malt flavor with light hop under/overs. I can't figure why this beer is the flavor of the spell, but it's a serviceable enough upgrade over mass-produced lite beers. You can do better.","Rast","Mar 20, 2013"

The head was lightly brown, frothy and had a bit of staying power - there was plenty of lacing the entire way down the bottle. What surprised me was the distinct caramel smell that I found appealing and added just a little to the taste. Mouthfeel wasn't anything spectacular, carbonation was a bit more than I like. Overall it was a great beer, I'm jealous with Californians, they have a very good selection of brews at their local restaurants.","jjamadorphd","Mar 07, 2013"

Flavor is sweet with biscuit and slight honey, some chocolate malt, and the tartness from the yeast prevails towards the end of the flavor profile. I'm guessing noble hops are used, as the finish of flavor is nectar and flowery that goes well with the sweet Belgian malt. Well balanced with a middling mouthfeel and a balanced finish. Easily drinkable with a sweetness is my take away from this beer.","Philousa","Feb 27, 2013"

It's sessionable as hell and I'm sure it's pretty good on tap, but as a beer with dinner type of beer, this just wouldn't be my first choice. It's above average with a good/or lack of? aftertaste.

The nose is refreshing, and nice not to get hit with a bag of citrus fruit. The biscuit/bready malt is surprisingly forward. Hops are floral and fruity (and yeast). Taste follows with lots of biscuit/bready sweet Belgium style malt and a bit of caramel. Hops are subdued, but floral and noble in nature. Also fruity yeast character. Mouthfeel is smooth and has good balance. Overall a fine beer, but I prefer SA Lager or Honkers Ale to this.","WoodBrew","Nov 24, 2012"
