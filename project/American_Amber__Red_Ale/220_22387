The taste followed with an initial sweet malt that quickly jumped into a mega hop dose of slight resinous pine and more citrus and tropical fruit bitterness. It leaves a burnt toffee and hop bitterness on your tongue between pulls and even has hints of floral hops as the flavor lingers. This Imperial Red Ale from Lagunitas has me back on the red ale fence.","brurevu","Oct 29, 2014"

Could be an imperial IPA if the color didn't push into into the red ale category.  Flavorwise, too, this is hop-forward, full of left coast sensibilities.  Finish is pretty dry, and light.  For what an imperial amber could have been, this is not too malty or syrupy.  There is a little nuance of residual sweetness, but it works quite nicely here.  Overall this is a well balanced West coast Red Ale and well worth enjoying.","hreb","Oct 28, 2014"

4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"O: The red ale was once the darling of the craft beer movement. No more. In fact, most hardened beer geeks tend to avoid them like a plague. The style has a reputation for being bland and uninteresting these days. However, if you are going to brew a red ale and expect it to sell, this is how you do it. You make sure it's big and plenty hoppy. There is nothing bland or pedestrian about this beer. It's worth your time and money.","ryan1788a5","Oct 10, 2014"

Aroma is remarkable; sweet caramel malts followed by some citrus hops, grapefruit, orange and a bit of sugar (can't tell if its my nose playing tricks, but the combined aromas give it a candy type smell). The taste features more malts, with sweet caramel leading the way, with some brown sugar added. Biscuit/bread malts are very present as well. Citrus shines through as it warms. Remarkably well balanced. A bit of pine sticks of the tongue as it goes down. This one is dangerously easy to drink-- I feel like I could have two more in the next hour. The alcohol is masked expertly, with very little sign of its moderate level. Not much carbonation. Overall, another solid entry from Lagunitas. Easy to drink, and a great deal for the price.

Huge citrus hop nose as expected, grapefruit, orange, lemon, lime, along with some tropical pineapple and mango, pine needles, black tea bag, caramels. Taste is initially huge huge citrus bloom, followed by a bready/toffee middle section, and ending with some tropical fruit leather and strongly tannic tea bag. Pretty pungent and powerful but not completely overbearing. Little alcohol flavor. Fresh orange juice, brown spices, and raisins winking through. Quite fizzy and this potentiates the spicy resin effect on the tongue. I like that this stays more anchored in toffee/citrus/tea territory as opposed to the tropical realm, although the latter is certainly there. There is considerable sweetness here ... Even the head tastes sweet (said your mom). The aggressive hop regime keeps this in check, however, and the finish is decidedly tannic and bitter with a lingering fruitiness. Wonderful.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 16, 2014"

Smells citrusy and piney with caramel notes and a little burnt toast. Taste follows the nose. A nice amount of bitterness. 54 IBU might not seem like a lot but it's just right for this brew. Maybe a bit of tropical fruit in there as well and some malty sweetness. Not a trace of alcohol in this but at 7.8% it's pretty potent.  Mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Not a sticky beer though. Carbonation is great, fits with the style. Overall, a fantastic beer and excellent example of the modern Red Ale. Is it an IPA? Is it a Red? No, it's somewhere in between and I love it just the way it is. Lagunitas never disappoints.","MisSigsFan","Sep 11, 2014"

It's no where near as hoppy as green flash hop head red but I want a bit more sweetness. If I'm going to drink an amber ale I'd rather it not taste like an ipa with a touch of malt. The taste is decently bitter and it lingers more on the hoppy side. This beer is very easy to drink and quite tasty but it is not how I would represent the style.

The smell is unremarkable, but the taste is pretty nice. This is also highly drinkable, as the mouthfeel is spot-on for the style (whatever style you want to call this hybrid). Anyway, adding a lot of hops to an otherwise successful red ale just doesn't work--even though I love hops. I love the great bomber price, but the "Imperial" red ale falls short as the balance is lost and the style is compromised in an effort to appease hop-heads (including myself).","DeFaz","Aug 23, 2014"

I prefer it to the lucky 13 red beers they make, its more lively and unique. the price makes it that much better too!","StonedTrippin","Aug 13, 2014"

The nose is pink grapefruit with it's sweet little backing, earthy pine, some fresh orange and a biscuit like malt that promises a bit of sugar. Taste is excellent. The mouthfeel is pristine. A touch of weight from that malt and then airy lightness but smooth. Good carbonation that goes largely unnoticed. The beer is a touch sticky and lip smackingly so with a bit of resin that coats the tongue and lets a bit of the grapefruit pith and the earthy pine come through just a bit more before the creamy smooth malt rolls through to the finish. Finishes with a slight bitter that is a lovely accent to all the fruitiness of this beer.","utopiajane","Aug 13, 2014"

4.1,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/7/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine. pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial red ale. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

The smell was a bit subdued but I was able to pick up on citrus and floral notes from the hops as well as a lot of sweet scents from the malt. The taste was great with a little burst of hops in the beginning and then a long smooth toasty flavor from the malt. Very tasty. I also liked the mouthfeel, a bit heavier than your average red but not overly thick. Would definitely recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 31, 2014"

It is caramelly and spicey and smooth and tender and smacks of everything that is good about beer in general and life itself.

I do, however, question an Imperial Red that has so many hop flavors that the sugars are somewhat lost; I would have been happier with this beer tasting it blind, rather than knowing its supposed style. As it is, the beer comes across to this drinker as overly-hopped and therefore out of balance, and needed a stronger sugary backbone to better showcase the Imperial Red flavors. Still, it is worth trying, for the hops are rather nice; think of it as a strong IPA, and you’ll be fine.","jondeelee","Apr 27, 2012"

Beautiful, beautiful clarity to this beer, but I think a redder hue could have been achieved. I can smell this one from across the room, which is just how I feel it should be with a beer like this. Piney hops, caramel sweetness, a little bit of bread and yeast, as well as plenty of spice on the aroma. Comes on pleasantly sweet before the hops assault your tongue, bitterness builds, things balance for a moment, sweetness shines through, and then bitterness returns for the finish, which could have been a touch more clean. Still, a total joyride in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is sticky, no surprise there, and this is a full figured beer, no lack of body, perhaps too much for some but I can dig it. Carbonation level is dead on. As a package, this is a knockout of an American brew. This is a great representation of what an outstanding brewery can do these days in the "go big" department. Not that it is an Imperial Stout kind of big, but the flavor is in that league. There is a time and a place to enjoy a subtle beer, just like there is for a loud bold one like this. Loved it, could have another. Three? Hard to say. This is a lot, and that is the joy of it.","kc44","Apr 11, 2012"

I thought this beer had pretty good drinkability, I always drink it quicker then I expect, it's smooth and has more then enough flavor to hold my interest, two or three of these would be nice on a warm day. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, all aspects of this beer were well done. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness in the flavor, the flavor was still good, but if the sweetness was toned down a little it would be a 4.5. I would buy this beer again, this six pack isn't lasting as long as I thought so I can see getting another one before they are all gone. I recommend giving this beer a try, I think it will appeal to Red Ale lovers and hop heads. No surprise here this is another good brew from Lagunitas, they never seem to disappoint me and that's why they are one of my favorite out of state brewerys, they make really good beers and this one is no exception, keep it up guys, I would like to see some other brews you got that haven't been made in a while.","StoutHunter","Apr 01, 2012"

Smells of rich malts and some herbal hops - atypical for Lagunitas's style, but welcome nonetheless. I like it as a traditional red ale. Medium sweetness countered with bitterness and some herbal notes juxtaposed with a slight bitter orange peel flavor. A little more bitter than I'd like. Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb and a dry finish. Decent beer, but nothing outstanding.","harrymel","Mar 26, 2012"

Smell is reminiscent of a west coast barleywine - huge on hops, huge on malt, nicely balanced. Pleasantly surprised by this. Hops take a back seat to the malts on the tongue. Some obvious metallic malts, like a good brown ale. The hops definitely follow suit though with a big citrus after burn.

Taste is not far from what you would expect from a Lagunitas IPA...however, they call this an Imperial Red. I see how it does have more of a malt backbone than most of there IPAs, but at the same time, it is hoppier than a lot of breweries' IPA. Taste is citrus fruit with some hop resin and pine needles.

Citrusy, fruity taste with plentiful hops but a nice malt layer. Bitter, but not overly so. It makes for a quite nice taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation.

It tasted like copper and grapefruit and orange hops, with brown sugar and roasted barley malts. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a great scent and taste for a red ale. It had nice body too, and hid the alcohol very well, so it was definitely easy to drink. This seemed to use the same hops as Hop Stoopid, Little Sumpin Sumpin, etc. only with a more roasted red ale malt.

Not the most interesting beer out there.","Phyl21ca","Dec 22, 2009"

Spicy Hops up front on the tastebuds, nice malt backbone, sweet over bready, sticky brown sugar sweetness, with a decent bitter finish. Hops become more present as brew warms up. Good carbonated mouthfeel which surprised me after the minimal head. Significant alcohol heat in the finish inhibits drinkability.

For the fall, I couldn't think of a better beer to have from the Golden State, with the exception of a Sierra Nevada or Anchor seasonal. It's stuff like this that makes me realize how much I miss the Golden State and what it has to offer.

Frothy lacing on the sides, the head bows into the center because of the lack of carbonation. Deep amber red color, very hazy but appealing. Aroma is full of both caramel malt tones and citrus hops, both of which are strongly present in the beer, but not overwhelmingly assertive. The flavors blend well with the low carbonation and cask character of the beer. Alcohol is not present in the taste at all and it is drinkable like a mild ale.","wiseguy142","Oct 12, 2009"

The hoppy sense of this fades with warming while the malts are kicked up and thus eventually winning the battle, making for a sweet/smooth ride. Medium bodied with near perfect carbonation, it was a bit high in the beginning.

4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Reddish brown color with a nice cream-colored cap of foam. A good amount of lacing persists and creates a nice rim around the glass. A whiff of hops on the aroma that seems a little subdued but is definitely pleasant and inviting. The hops come through on the first sip with a nice bitter grapefruit body that's strengthened by a sturdy backbone of grains and roasted malt characters. Nicely balanced between malt and hop. Medium body with some weight provided by the maltiness paired with a nice lifting quality of the hops. A very drinkable brew. A good choice for some one who likes hops but isn't into DIPA's or any other super hoppy concoctions. A well-balanced hoppy affair.","apbarwood","Oct 08, 2009"

3.85,-6.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a deep brown with red highlights and a single-finger head. The smell is a mix of different hops including some piney and citrusy notes with a solid malt backbone. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that gives way to a bit of piney hops followed by some grapefruit bitterness. The mouthfeel is moderately thick with a decent amount of carbonation. This is one of those beers that incredibly hoppy but balanced well enough to be completely drinkable. Another good offering from Lagunitas.","TheTrevor","Aug 18, 2009"

4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"A solid Imperial IPA. Great hops aroma; classic CA sharp citrus hops and red malts. I tend to think of IPAs as falling into one of two categories: 1) crisp (more citrusy IPAs, floral, resinous and clean) and 2) musty IPAs, big aggressive hops [i.e. Warrior] can impart a vegetal, grassy, garlicky earthiness that tends to be a little more interesting than the crispy IPAs, but not as drinkable). This beer is definitely the first category. Taste is aggressively hopped (in a good way); sharper and more pronounced flower and pine characters than I would normally expect from a "red ale." There's the fruitiness (I detect lime, which is a little different) and the floral characters, and then the beer finishes with a lingering bitterness that tapers into a numbing spice. Mouthfeel is full and rich, slightly thicker/more viscous than your average IPA, finishes velvlety and smooth.","TheNapkin","Aug 13, 2009"

The flavors were also big and full of lemon and citrusy hops. The pineapple was notable in the profile and I really enjoyed it. I also tasted some in-your-face alcohol, sweet malts, dark caramel, toffee and hints of wood in the roasted malt. The body was full, the mouthfeel good and the carbonation a bit frothy.

Quite a chewy feel, probably a bit heavier than it needs to be. Fairly soft carbonaton, probably could use a bit more; finishes bitter. A bit disappointed in this brew.

A springy hop presence is very noticeable and expected since this is a red ale, but also a large, chewey bread malt presence is picked up just in the nose along with some caramel and some other sweetness like maple syrup and/or butterscotch. Those malts are more evident in the taste as this beer is medium-to-full bodied with a great balance of both citric/floral hops that lead to a dry, mildly bitter hop finish. But the beer also contains a slightly syrupy/sticky malt taste full of sweetness like caramel, maple, maybe some gum or something slightly sugary. Overall it is a smooth, creamy beer that passes easily and even has a warming sensation on the pallete albeit I'd say the ABV is mostly hidden (never would've guess over 7%).

Solid amber red color, fully unblemished and transparent, sits tranquilly under all that foam. The nose has an unassuming power to it, you don't notice how full your nostrils are until they're saturated with pine resin, lemon citrus, carob, dried honey, croissant flakes and peach alongside cherry and red apple fruit scents, just enjoyable to sniff without bothering to wonder why. Medium-bodied, same perfect balance between malts and hops as found in the nose. More fruity here with cherry, apricot, peach and sweet apple flavors. More honey and pink grapefruit, lemon citrus too yet never gets "sweet" per se. The grain aspect tempers the herbaceous qualities so it's not arch nor bitter either. The pine aspects subtle. The carbonation wisely remains in the shadows and allows the flavors to stand or fall on their own.

There is a strong caramel presence, with grapefruit, and pine in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is one fine beer.

Smell, to me, is grapefruit rind oil and not much else. If you're in the mood for hops, but don't really want to go the route of your standard American IPA, this'll fix ya' right up. Taste, too, seemed to be very assertive hops with little else to accompany it. This is good beer, for sure, but alas, yet *another* over-the-top hop bomb.

This stuff combines potent ABV, potent flavors and you-will-be-doing-stupid-stuff-later drinkability. My kind of elixer. I wouldn't normally plagerize for a review, but the stuff that Lagunitas wrote on their bottle is too good to be missed. Here is the description verbatum:"This special ale is, in reality, a reconstructed exhumation of the very first ale that we ever brewed way, way, back in 1993. Brewed with a big head, a muscular malty thorax, a silky texture & all strung together with a hoppy sweet nerve sack...yum." Pretty cool.

There was a nice balance between the hop bitterness and malt sweetness - a more understated hop presence than in an IPA - as it should be. Thick lacing down the pint glass by the end of it all - and with a fairly decent, lingering hop bitterness. An enjoyable beer, although not as pumped-up as some of their other offerings. Their Kill Ugly Radio is still my favorite - try it if you get the chance - it is on-tap here at Frisco as I write this review.","pershan","Dec 20, 2007"

Herbal, piny hop bitterness greets the tongue. Sugar cookie and fruit malt sweetness follow. Numbing, herbal hop bitterness around the edges. Pine sap and Scotch tape join in as the hop levels increase into the slightly warming, cookie dough finish. Medium-full body with an initial creamy feel that ends stickier. Very good.","alexgash","Dec 10, 2007"

Alcohol is so well hidden for 7.6%, would make a great session beer if it wasn't for the alcohol content. A really nice beer when your hankering for a nice hoppy beer but also want a good amount of malt sweetness. Definitely a beer I will buy again. Highly recommended.

Mad hops come through in this beer, very stimulating for the taste buds. Quite bubbly as well, which seems to fit with all the other characteristics. Not long until you feel that warmth.

To me the mouth of this beer was much better than average, but I like heavy beers. I get a well balanced hit of the hop bitterness followed by a hint of carmel malts and a whallop of thick malty goodness at the end.

The hops and malt are both present in the nose with the malt winning out. The initial taste is of the malt which is quickly balanced by just the right amount of bitterness. As it warms the alcohol flavor kicks in and provides a near perfect balance of flavors. It has a thickness that lingers on the tongue for a wonderful mouthfeel. This is an exceptional beer!

What is really impressive is that the flavors blend flawlessly, creating one flavor. Nice. Medium body with great tasting water. Pleasure. I don't know about imperial, but this is really a nice beer.

Pours a clear amber/reddish color with a big ivory head. Head retention and lacing are excellent. Smell gave a promise of hoppiness and also a scent/flavor that I couldn't identify. Some people refer to toffee in connection to the malts. I didn't get any standard malty scent or flavor so I'll go with "toffee" also. Taste was good....hoppy as a good IPA but with this additional flavor as well. Mouthfeel is fairly rich....the first swallow provides the coating for the rest of the beer...nothing thin about this one. Very crisp and hoppy.

About a finger and a half of thick, dense, bubbly white head formed from a somewhat vigorous pour. Head faded a bit on the quick side, but left decent lace behind. Smell was of fresh floral hops, a nice citrus and pine burst, a nice maltiness, and a hint of caramel. Taste was as good, maybe a bit better than the nose.

There is a nice moderate earthy hop in there that adds nicely to the grainyness of the malt. I like the earthy quality of the beer. The flavor is very nice. It is incredibly strong in earthy British hops that pairs well with a solid biscuit malt graineyness. There is a mild caramel malt behind it that adds sweetness that really rounds things out. The bitterness really hits nicely on the finish, while maintaining some reserve and not being offensive. This is a nice tasting brew. The feel is thick, with a solid modeate carbonation to it. I am a fan of this brew. Even though the earthy flavors are not my favorite, I think this one makes them very approchable.

The beer poured exceptionally clear, and had a hue that was amber, tinged with ruddy pink. The head was two fingers high, and the carbonation was steady and finely textured, so the head lingered on. While the looks were quite stunning, the mild aroma was subtly redolent with citric and floral hops. The taste was quite balanced for the style, with the bitter hops being just a little more dominant than the succulent caramel and pale malts. The hoppy aftertaste was supplemented by saltwater taffy like mouthfeel that was both sticky and mineralized dry at the same time. It did however feel thinner than what the label description suggested. Although classified as an American Strong Ale around here, I find this to be lot more similar to a standard (or a double) IPA. At first, it was hard to believe they rate this at 84.20 IBU, which is starting to approach Ruination territory, but as the pint glass neared emptiness, and the hop burps reached a crescendo, the realization hit that I had basically been immunized with Pacific Northwest hops.

4.32,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"650ml Imperial Red, with more ridiculous but lovely nonsense on the label from Lagunitas. Nice to see this, a SEASONAL from a US micro(doesn't happen too often up here), at the Kensginton Wine Market. Popping the cap gives a wafting aroma of rubber and brown sugar. The beer's colour is in between ruby and light orangish-red. Actually the hue itself is somewhat hard to describe...but I like it. Possibly a very dark rusty water or cola with red food colouring. The head is long-lived and compact with seamless little bubbles, cream-coloured. Walls of whiter lacing that cling well. Exquisite appearance, though interestingly a little "browner" than other reds I have sampled. Aroma--now this is what I was looking for this week. After the Maximus last night and Rogue's DIPA, this beer's maltier but still hop-filled smell is a welcome guest to the nose. What I like about the aroma is how it makes you continually sniff in order to find if the hops or the malts are dominant...what's the word?...oh yeah: balance. Wonderful complementing of the thick barley notes with spicy wild citrus hops. The malting makes the first impression, burnt and almost barley-wine sweet. Phenolic, solvent-like, piquant, with notes of licorice and horehound, almost medicinal. The sugar is all here too, like bubble gum and caramel, toffee, and vanilla wafer. I also get some faint strawberry, and a little lemon. Now thrust your nose deeper into the glass and get your dose of some earthy tree-bark hoppiness, perhaps a little hard to find at first, but once they come out it really shows off how well-hopped the beer really is. Just enough. The beer's nose is fantastic. The taste does not disappoint, starting with fairly basic but tasty roasted gristiness. The beer is a little weak on the front of the tongue actually, but the middle and finish make up for it with a wonderful rush of soft but bitter hopping and leaving the mouth with lip-smacking sweetness with the floral hopping adding some sweet perfume flavours. Again, balance is the name of the game. Cinnamon and chicory, lactosy malts that bring tastes of buttered toast and peanuts. Red licorice and light brown sugar, with some mollasses. Sweet, but with enough hopping to satisfy the h-heads. Complex enough, but beyond the complexity is just the solidity of the malts working with hops and vice versa. A medium carbonation, moderate bitterness, and very little alcoholic burn make this an extremely drinkable strong red ale. Through balance, Lagunitas just made this beer WORK, by coincidence or design matters not...this is a flavourful slaker of my thirst. I will be buying more.","Cwrw","May 18, 2006"

4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Never had an "Imperial Red" before...most likely a highly-hopped amber ale? Let's see: Poured into a standard pint glass, the beer is a shimmering transparent copper with a thick, clinging ecru head. Detectable aromas of pine sap and bitter citrus pith -- confirmation of extra hops, I imagine. Indeed, the hop content of Lagunitas' Imperial Red Ale is certainly on the high side: notes of grapefruit rind and sweetish blood oranges. Malt presence is discernible, but only just, and primarily as a caramel/toffee flavor fighting for survival in a sea of hop juice. Bitter piney finish -- Chinooks maybe? Sticky lacing clumps around the glass in a web pattern. Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, and smooth. Thicker body than most red/amber ales, but nothing too hefty.

Tastewise this one starts off with bitter hops. The hops are briefly interrupted by sweeter malt notes before the hops come back in the finish. The flavors and body of the beer are very full and well-rounded. This is a very well rounded beer; its only drawback is drinkability, which is diminished by its weight in the stomach, which is pretty substantial.

Poured into a regular pint glass... very attractive and somewhat translucent red color, with a rich white head. The first thoughts I had were "this tastes like an IPA" and "this tastes like cranberries." And despite not being a huge cranberry fan, I was definitely a huge fan of this beer. Very hoppy, sort of piney flavor to it. Definitely tasted like a high-alcohol beer, but in a good way. If you like strong bitter ales and/or IPAs, give this a try!","NolateM","Apr 13, 2006"

Flavors in lock step with IBU listed on label. Not sure where this fits in style, other than it has 7%+ ABV for an American strong ale. I would need some grilled meat with a heavy sauce to stand up to the hops in this brew. Overall a happy hoppy experience although 40+ IBU's are a little much for me unless enjoyed with a balancing meal.","KingofNoPo","Apr 11, 2006"

4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Much more hops than expected from an American Red Ale; that's why is characterized by an American Strong Ale. Hop aroma is evident even before the glass reaches the nose. Pine and flowery aromas swirl around a bready, malty sweet smell. Tastes boldly of sweet malts: bready, caramelly, lightly toasted, and a tad grainy. The the hops...more than just bittering. Flowery flavors, herbal, grassy, earthy, and a little dirty (for extra measure). The taste is muddled a bit, but certainly adds character to an otherwise unappealing brew. Finishes dryer than expected from Reds because of the hop character and alcohols that go largely forgotten. I look forward to having another.","BEERchitect","Apr 03, 2006"

Aroma of fresh floral hops, with a little bit of sweet malt in the background. Palate is thick with both assertive floral hops and lightly sweet malt. Notes of pine and and light fruit come through. Body is nice and sturdy, with a slightly syrupy feel that provides a warming finish. Still, the alcohol is hidden fairly well. Overall, I have to say this one is pretty tasty.","ElGordo","Mar 18, 2006"

A bit more malt might play up the citrus notes a bit more, and soften the raw hoppiness a bit. As it is you will definitely want to be a hop head to enjoy this one. Luckily I can be, and am, so this is quite enjoyable.","Gueuzedude","Mar 16, 2006"

It has a very bitter hop flavor with a nice solid malt base. It boasts of crystal and roasted malts and adds good balance. The mouthfeel is fine.

Aroma is sweet malts with a potent leafy, fruity pine hops aroma. The taste follows the nose, with sticky sweetness on the lips, but balanced and more so by the potent hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is very nice as well. One of the better imperials from Lagunitas, nice to see them not over do the hops here.","ppoitras","Aug 26, 2005"

3.65,-11.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I know that this is not the highest IBU brew out there, but the hops just laid heavy over the malt body, giving it just enough exposure to tantalize, but not enough to be able to savor. And that's a shame, because the malt spine of the beer did tease with some worthwhile elements worthy of further exploration and discovery. But, the hops, and their rather simplistic bittering result, just weren't interesting enough to be the headliner. Nothing offensive here, and it IS drinkable, on the surface, but considering I can get hops lots of places, and often with something a bit more going on in partnership, I'd have to say it was enough of a disappointment that I won't be dipping back into this well unless it was pretty much devoid of real competition.","Foxman","Jun 17, 2005"

Spotted lace. Nose is both malts and hops. Another off-style beer. Almost a double (I)PA. Not quite sure. Taste is really nicely balanced with the malts and hops. At first sweet and malty, but then followed up with a fairly potent hoppy kick. Served cold; it reminds me of wintergreen gum. Would that be minty? Can't pick up any of the alcohol in this beer. Medium body, but the best quality of this beer is that it does not tire the taste buds but has all sorts of nuances.","MuddyFeet","May 27, 2005"

4.35,5.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Well, Imperial RED Ale isn't red, it's more of a clear darkish amber. The mouthfeel is great- there's enough maltiness, bitterness and just the right amount of carbonation.

Some Lagunitas beers I've noticed have an odd almost grainy mouthfeel. This one has it, but it's not as pronounced as I remember is some others. Not a big deal really but I thought I'd mention it.

4.27,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Deep copper to garnet in color, very clear with a thick cream colored head. I was expecting malt up front in the aromas, but was pleasantly surprised when a pronounced hop flower character came across. This was backed by a grapefruit/citrus note, the bread dough that Lagunitas yeast brings, and finally a caramel character form the malt. The taste has the same hop-forward character. More hop flower and more of an orange peel citrus. I dont catch the yeast quality in the flavor. The malt really balances the hops well in this beer. I enjoy Lagunitas beers when they pour on the hops. I wish their was more of this character in the standard IPA. It has a slightly slick mouth feel, and is very drinkable.","carln26","Apr 11, 2005"
3.89,-5.6,4.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Clear, deep ruddy bronze hue. Mountainous, dense, whipped fresh cream like head yields dogged, frothy lace. Soft pine and underripe orange upfront in aroma, with secondary hints of dark toffee and sweet biscuit. Incipient in flavor is a snap of medium lovibond caramel sweetness, which is promptly ensued by agreeably sharp, pithlike hop bitterness. Bitterness is aptly complemented by notions of tangerine marmalade, ghostly spruce and mellow strawberry-esque sweetness. Moderate in body, with an agreeably airy and fluid mouthfeel. Finishes with a fleeting resurgence of fruity sweetness akin to fresh squeezed grapefruit and caramel. Quite a tasty brew, with a balanced flavor profile and superb drinkability. Yet another regular in my fridge has been discovered.","marc77","Apr 10, 2005"
4.33,5.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Its clear copper body has a reddish cast beneath its full head of creamy ivory froth. The head retention is excellent, and it leaves sheets of think lace draped about at the outset of the glass. Resinous, grassy, piney/spruce-like, and citrusy hops dominate the nose over a seemingly-sweet and toffe-ish malt. The mouthfeel is medium-full and creamy-smooth across the palate with just a light tingle from its moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. Hops return in the flavor, wrapped in a soft, luscious malt that's seductively sweetish but not quite sweet, decidedly caramel accented, softly bready, and even a touch biscuity. Yeasty fruitiness accents everything, and brings the citrusy hop notes forward, leaving the piney and resinous characteristics to help the firm bitterness balance things by lingering dryly in the finish. There's alot going on, and yet it's incredibly straightforward and balanced leaving it drinkable to say the least; and the alcohol never makes an appearance beyond when you go to get up from your seat and realize you may have had too much of a good thing. Very nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Apr 05, 2005"
3.68,-10.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Big, bulbous mushroom cap of head that settles to a crenellated frothing. Crystal clear red hue with some mahogany tints and no action. Fair amount of hop spice on nose, some lemony malt floating around too. To taste, nice red bite, but more so, with a light woody character, almost imperceptible; a thin coating of toasted sesame comes up for air.
