The taste has faded caramel, lemon juice, and faint bitterness.  Not the best tasting beer for style fairly abrasive actually.  Has an oxidized note of sherry.  Hop flavor helps somewhat.  Light bodied, cardboard dry and not moreish in the slightest.  Overall, not too good.","Stinkypuss","Thursday at 09:59 PM"

Like I stated earlier, due to the aroma, I was expecting a much hoppier beer than I got, but this beer is very nicely balanced.  Good malt, good hops, good sweetness.  Good beer.","Jeffreysan","Jan 26, 2015"
