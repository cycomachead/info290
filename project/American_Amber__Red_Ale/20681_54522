The taste was expertly balanced with piney hops coming through and then a bit of the sweet malt. The finish was very clean with a citrus finish that left you wanting another sip. Loved this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 24, 2015"

Nose carried a nice amount of hops and an earthiness, which I mention in the taste on the backend. Finishes crisp and virtually no sweetness hanging around on the tongue despite just a bit in this well balanced taste. Really a great beer that I would not have thought twice about had I not been drawn to check out everything they have because of the Lunch and Dinner craze.","gopens44","Mar 10, 2015"

Aroma is a delicious understated piney hop.  The flavor picks up some of the darker caramel malts and is almost a touch toasted copper.  The  alcohol is mostly well-hidden but breaks through at the back of the palate.  Amber ales are not my thing but this is very nice.  My first MBC beer.  I will certainly seek out others.","KidDoc","Feb 04, 2015"

4.21,0.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours a dark red/brown color with a thick tan head. Smells of pine, citrus, and a little chocolate. Taste is fairly well balanced between malt and hops. A lot of roasty, chocolaty malts complemented by pine and citrus hops. Some dark fruit in there too. This isn't as much a hoppy amber as it is a Black IPA. Much darker and roastier than other hoppy ambers I've had. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy and carbonation is pretty low. I usually like my hoppy beers to be lighter and crisper. Overall, a pretty good amber. MBC definitely did their own thing with it.","MisSigsFan","Nov 15, 2014"

The liquid is clear and transparent, a very dark reddish brown, looks like the color of library furniture, sedate and serious, almost zero bubbles visible. The nose is expressive with grapefruit, pine leading into malted milk balls, chocolate, coffee and caramelized brown sugar, then veers back to earthy hops and leafy matter, apple and pear skin all you get for fruit, keenly penetrating and erect posture in the nostrils. Full-bodied for the character, has decent enough carbonation yet still sits like a bowling ball on the tongue. Leads with biting white grapefruit zest and green grass notes before the more roasty coffee, mocha steps up. Pine and flowers pull it away from malty sweetness and here there’s greater depth of apricot, peach and pear fruit. Some breadiness and a hint of summer corn but not strong enough to counteract the overall bitterness. Overall, appears to choose power and simplicity over subtlety, no complaints here.","farrago","Aug 05, 2014"

4.25,1.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Another great beer from Maine Beer Company. As usual, this beer is dry rather than sweet, crisp, and has a nice hoppy profile without reliance on big citrus notes. Very balanced with a long bitterness, and enough very dry malt to sustain the piney and herbal hops. A lighter colored amber than many, and the malt is downplayed in favor of the hops. Delicious!","Georgiabeer","Jul 02, 2014"

4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a reddish brown body with good head and lace patches. A very hoppy aroma that is floral and somewhat fresh along with touches of both roasted and sweet caramel malts. This beer is more hoppy than sweet but there is not only a large chunk of floral, citric hops with touch of fruit sweetness but also a large portion of roasted, breadlike malts. The malts balance with the hops for a hoppy beer that has minimal sweetness but good malty dryness and finishes dry. A hearty, medium-bodied red that is a sipper and not your average hop bomb with sweet malts but a more robust, dry beer.","clayrock81","May 14, 2014"

4.15,-1.2,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Bottle poured into an American pint glass. I was immediately struck by the relatively dark color, a near-brown reddish bronze with an amazingly thick and rich light tan head. Smells like a dark IPA, tons of spicy grapefruit and orange on top of a nutty, toffee-like malt base. Considerable herbal and pine character as well. Like its IPA counterparts, this Maine offering comes off juicy, fresh, spicy, and extremely hoppy across the board, although here the sweet malts keep up admirably. Near perfect balance, truth be told. I focused on the hops first, an evolution from grapefruit and orange rind to a lychee-like perfume to astringent green banana to strong pine and then mellowing out to well-steeped black tea. Fantastic. The malts deliver a lot of biscuit or semi-sweet cookie flavor, some toffee and hazelnut almost like a well-crafted English brown ale, faint chocolate and tobacco. The mouthfeel is quite bold and prickly, thin to moderate body and moderate to high carbonation with a slick resinous finish of unripe bramblefruit and tomato leaf. The fruit really develops nicely near the end of a bottle, straight up Simcoe raspberry jam and earthy pine. As was the case for Another Round and Mo, its hard to find much wrong here. Maybe the bitterness and pine are a tad much for the style? Regardless, epic brew and not to be missed by hops and sweet malt fans alike. This one captures both dimensions at the same time without either being swamped.","CalgaryFMC","May 09, 2014"

Seemed to be lacking flavor for me; not sure but maybe my palate was off or the 30 days since bottling has robbed the brew of taste.

Beautiful citrus hops dominate the nose, while the taste is a mixture of bitter hops up front and a delicate, chocolate-like lingering on the back. Appearance is dark -- like a mix of brown and mahogany. A prominent creamy head contributes. Not a session beer by any means, like some of MBC's other offerings, but Zoe is an excellent full-bodied example of the amber style. If you find Nugget Nectar overly assertive or fruity, try Zoe instead. I know many who prefer it.","Mineo","Mar 08, 2014"

4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottled 12/1/13 that's what Philly sells to the Pittsburgh market. I'll take it though. Dark amber bordering on a mahogany brown hue, light tan head just barley off white. Aromatics hints of dark chocolate, herbal earthy hops, east coast style hops but rock solid so far. Just a hint of tart/citric/grapefruit notes with oxidized hops starting with some biscuit/caramel malts thrown in as well. Complex beer I like MBC with the two beers I've had so far before Zoe, were Peeper Ale and King Titus. Flavor wise there's just a touch of cardboard starting in the malt department, I don't see any infection years just a hint of oxidation from the age. Bitterness from the hops makes it through each sip, earthy citric notes with a semi-sweet dark amber malt base, it drinks really well share a bottle with a friend and it will be gone in no time. These are the type of beers I wish were available locally. Overall I really enjoy this beer, and I appreciate the east coast style hops especially in an amber ale.","WVbeergeek","Mar 02, 2014"

Pine and grapefruit are most dominant, but I also get a good amount of navel oranges and a little mint. The mid palate brings out flavors of toffee, brown sugar, burnt sugar and caramel, but thankfully, this beer isn't particularly sweet. In fact, the way this feels on the palate reminds me again of NN. Bitter on the finish with a mild pine resin character, this beer is medium light in body and has a medium high level of carbonation. The carbonation level is a little higher than I'd like, but the flavors and balance on the finish is excellent.  Excellent stuff, I imagine this would be incredible on cask. Very highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Dec 07, 2013"

Aromas of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Moderate earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, mango, citrus, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent hoppy amber ale. All around great complexity and balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 05, 2013"

Overall, I thought this was mediocre and undeserving of the high ratings it receives. The exorbitant expense of the beer (at various locations in the DC metro area) had kept me from purchasing it. It's an amber ale after all. I don't comprehend the price for such a beer. So I finally gave in and tried it. Disappointing.","Huhzubendah","Sep 10, 2013"

Very northwest: pine, resin, some grapefruit, some tea, Special B malt here on the nose (or the likes), and a bit of stones. Flavor is malt, tea, hops, some really aromatic character I just can't put my finger on, some toasted wheat bread. The flavor here is surprising and quite nice. Fairly full bodied for the style with low carb and a semi dry finish. I am really impressed with this beer. I'm happy with the divisive character of the nose vs flavor on this one. I am met initially with the impression that this will be a robust, in-your-face amber a la Troegs, but am met with a sophisticated, mature flavor profile hard to beat for the style in my opinion.

I like this side of red malt, its new, its sturdy, and its delicious. I would love to see more beers like this out there, I love its depth and careful yet aggressive hop complex. soft carbonation, full body, this appears to me as a fall beer, but I suppose its a heck of a drink around the calendar. maine beer company has impressed me so far, I am looking forward to the mean old tom ive got in the fridge, and anything else I can get my hands on from these guys.","StonedTrippin","Jul 02, 2013"

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with pine and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is very pine and herbal hop forward.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 13, 2013"

This is superior in many ways, but how a mass produced beer like this one can contain so many of the fresh, tannic aspects of homemade beers of this kind remains a mystery to me. Very flavorful, and never too heavy. This is an ode to bottle conditioning, and I hope more American breweries will continue to follow it. You can tell a lot of love and care went into this. For those of you bored with the American amber style, give this a shot. It's great.","magictacosinus","Jun 06, 2013"

4.15,-1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"A murky dark golden copper-brown color with a very healthy light tan head and super lacing. The aroma is surprisingly big with lots of nutty malt and pine hops as well as a little dark fruit. Really makes me think of something more along the lines of a barleywine or an imperial red. Very nice but not quite what I expected. The taste buds pick up a more blended mix of fruity malt and piney hops along with some grassy edges. The body is medium at best with tingly carbonation and a frothy feel. Very good though I'd say the aroma beats the flavor.","Durge","Nov 26, 2012"

This beer is an affirmation of why we love American ambers and reds so much. There is such variability to the style, with room for such robust hops, and playfully balancing malts and spice. Not only is this a fantastic beer, but the story on the back of the bottle is one of the cutest thoughts we’ve ever heard to the concept and conception of a beer.","TheBrewo","Nov 04, 2012"

4.17,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4," The taste has a light toast and cocoa-nuttiness with a mild tinge of citrus zest and pine hop flavoring. The hop flavors do add a slight chalkiness to the middle with mild bready malt coming into its own with subtle biscuit-like essence bu a nice interplay of the hops with mostly grapefruit flavor in the finish. Overall this kind of amber is kind of a red IPA as is has a very spicy and highly hopped example of the American Amber style which can range from dull and almost a brown to this style which is hop forward and yet still has a nice backbone of malt. I can't say enough good things about this it was as good as I hoped it would be with a nice refreshing dry finish.","Slatetank","Aug 18, 2012"

3.8,-9.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is an extremely dark, opaque, ruby highlighted brown coloring with a frothy, dense, foamy head that is off-white and starts around a half an inch, slowly settling into a nice, dense film. Aromas are rich and hoppy, with a resiny, green, floral and citrus aromas on a sweet caramel backbone. Smells delicious. Flavors are hop forward, with peppery spiced and floral characteristics leading the way. The malt profile gets a bit overshadowed by the strong hops presence, lending more of a red IPA feel to the beer. The caramel sweet backbone can be felt more at the end of the palate, along with a dark roasting characteristic. The bitter and reisny hops lead through to the aftertaste, as well, and the beer leaves a slick, foamy cling behind as you drink. The finish is dry and bitter, with a resiny linger left behind. Good, solid beer with some very strong and unique characteristics. If you are a hop head, this is a very pleasant beer to drink.","GarthDanielson","Mar 06, 2012"

It smells of dank, resinous pine. I'm a bit surprised there's nothing in the way of malt present. The flavor is a bit more varied though, and leads off with a smooth caramel swirl. That's followed by a mild wave of bitterness. The hoppy close is predominantly the same resinous pine notes present in the nose, but a bit of an herbal flavor creeps in at the end and adds a bit of complexity. The body is on the full side, and a little bit creamy, but the carbonation is almost nonexistent. A little more pep on that front would be a welcome addition.

Ultimate score for appearance. Fantastic nose that seems to be heavy on the "C" hops. Pine and grapefruit I abundance. The bottle is dated 102711 but the bouquet is still phenomenal. Perhaps it's a little subdued at the moment but it's a hop lovers wet dream. More of the grapefruit and pine on the tastebuds. Not really an amber ale as much as it's an IPA. It's reminiscent of Furious. Nice soft level of carbonation compliments a dry finish. Great beer.","hopsbreath","Dec 20, 2011"

4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Maine Brewing Company Zoe pours out the dark amber I Envisioned. A nice dark amber with some light brown shade and a tannish cap of foam up top leaving good amounts of foam on the glass. a decent amount of bubbles rising up. Smells awfully hoppy right off the tap. A nice mix of pine/earth backed with citrus. Trace amounts of pale malt ride up the tail end. Smells awfully clean and ready to drink. Drinking this is nice, what is advertised is delivered, a hoppy amber ale. The amount of biscuit coming from the malt drives down this nicely hopped ale into something more balanced, leading in the amber directon. Caramel seeps through gently and glides with the earth/pine/citrus. Feel is a step up from light with a nice carb that is felt. I could do a pint of this if the day and mood was right, I just don't see myself going out of my way for it. Reminds me of celebration ale.","BARFLYB","0"

The head was white and had a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer was hoppy, there wasn't too much else really happening besides some citrusy hops filling the nose. The taste is bitter but yet. Dry drinkable in my opinion. Has some sweetness in the flavor also. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a pretty good carbonation to it also.

There also is quite a bit of discernible alcohol in the aroma. The flavor offers a bit of toasty-roasty nuttiness atop the sweetness, as well as an earthy-herbal understated hoppiness.

Smells like a hoppy brown ale - nice light caramel and nutty toffee flavor. Very nice. The taste is extremely interesting. The malty and caramel nuttiness of the amber makes it come off as a brown ale. This is balanced by a pretty strong dose of hops, which come together really well. Drinks very easy.

Starts innocent enough with slight notes of grapefruit before a bitter earthy and pine kick comes through. Solid caramel malt adds sweet and creaminess before a big hoppy finish.

Mild bitterness, sweet malts, caramel, the aftertaste gives me a hint of roasted malts, sweet malt as well as grassy, floral hops. Medium mouthfeel. This beer is complex and well executed.

Pours a deep reddish brown with a nice off-white head. The aroma is big on caramel and hops. Citrus and pine notes abound. Mildly grassy. It’s just a big mix of caramel maltiness and pine resin/orange/grapefruit hoppiness. Taste is drier than expected, a welcome change from many strong ambers. Aftertaste is all citrus rind and resin. Full mouthfeel but not outstanding in any particular way. A very easy beer to drink and to like.","popery","0"

4.2,0,4,4,4.5,4,4,"At least Maine went with the traditional spelling (though I don't have too much against "Zooey", frankly)... Anyway, it pours a clear russet-garnet topped by a finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises pine, toffee, mint, and orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a more pronounced toffee character and the addition of a touch of cocoa. It's sweet, but not too; and it's hoppy, but not too. Very nicely done here. The body is a light medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice amber, the third consecutive winner from this brewery.

Much stronger earthy pine hop aroma than I expected in an "imperial amber". Taste has a big malt caramel backbone that did not come through as much in the smell to balance out the hops. Got some toasted biscuit taste in there to go along with a great balance of caramel malt and piney hop resinous bite. This beer has found a unique balance that I haven't found readily in other beers. Really enjoyed this one and will seek out again. Top notch stuff.","smokeypeat","Jul 13, 2011"

Lots of dank, uber-fresh piny hop flavor which is excellently complimented by the sweeter malt notes. Lots of chocolate, caramel and toffee flavor without getting in the way of the hops.

Taste is mildly caramel and a little sweet. Think of bready malt mixed with citrus, orange rind and tangerines. Hints of chocolate and citrus in a long lingering but fairly dry finish. Medium to light body is maybe the only thing I could suggest to improve this one. I would have loved a touch more body. Smooth resinous and candy like sweet mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation.

Hops dominate the nose, mostly pine, and subtle malt presence. At first sip... Mmm. Hoppy, yes, very bitter up front with lots of pine / spruce flavorings and some citrus, but also plenty of malt backbone for balance. Rustic, toasty bread malt and the slightest sweetness underneath the hops. Zesty. Excellent lingering dryness on the palate, yet a robust and supple mouthfeel, very sturdy. Really tasty beer here folks. And this beer is great w/ food. Having just moved to Portland I'm excited to have this available all the time. Definitely worth seeking out, as is their Peeper Ale - these guys are on a roll. I literally cannot wait to see what they brew next. Cheers!","twelvsies","May 15, 2010"
4.17,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Nice. I thought the taste was a little bit of a let down following the excellent smell. But overall, this is still a great hoppy amber and I would seek this out again. I imagine it's amazing fresh from the tap.","oregonskibum","May 10, 2010"
4.17,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Very nice beer. It's hoppy and smooth with a good malt backbone, very rich with an awesome carbonation. Some bitterness on the finish. The malt is very different from SNPA but the hoppy finish is reminiscent of it. Another great surprise from this small brewery, keep it up!","kingcrowing","May 10, 2010"

4.5,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beer is a dark amber with a creamy, ivory head that lingers. Smell is fresh and yeasty with some sharp piney hoppy notes. Taste has a nice malt backbone and an assertive mixture of caramel and pine and hops. It's complex and very good. The beer is fairly heavily carbonated, which makes it quite drinkable. The carbonation and the hops are a nice counterbalance to the dark malty/caramel stuff that's going on here. All in all, an excellent beer. This strikes me as a darker version of their Spring Peeper. Good stuff.","DoreenAndDave","Apr 25, 2010"
3.7,-11.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"d - A decent amber ale. I thought it smelled really nice but was somewhat lacking in the taste. I just didn't think the citrus and pine hops came through in the taste like they did in the smell. Would try again.","mdfb79","Apr 15, 2010"
4.45,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This was the second beer I've had from Maine Beer Company, and I have been very impressed. I thoroughly enjoyed Spring Peeper, but this one was even better. In an imperial pint glass the beer was a dark red/brown color with a huge tan head that resembled whipped cream. A nice amount of lace. A really sweet floral aroma, very outdoorsy, and a bit of citrus. Strong pine taste, as well as a little grapefruit. Some malt presence too, making this a very well-balanced beer. You need to find this and try it.","lordofthewiens","Apr 15, 2010"

4.3,2.4,5,5,4,4,4,"I'd have to say I prefer this over the cask format (as I usually do though). The strength is well hidden so I could have multiple of these no problem, although I think my tongue would get worn out from that burnt/bitterness aftertaste. Still, another great beer coming from MBC (definitely not to be confused with BMC).","deltatauhobbit","Apr 06, 2010"
4.17,-0.7,4.5,5,3.5,4,4.5,"The bar was set very high on this one with the aroma. This is a great beer and I'd definitely seek it out again.","Adamdc","Mar 28, 2010"

3.95,-6,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"A very interesting and enjoyable brew that straddles the line between styles. ABV is not noticeable whatsoever . Glad I picked up a couple of these, and I would grab more if I saw them.","MrMonkey","Mar 25, 2010"
4.64,10.5,4,5,5,4,4,"Body is perfect for the style, whatever that may be. Decent amount of carbonation, a cask version would be amazing I'm sure. The 7.2% ABV is not a factor at all and if it wasn't for the staying power of the flavor I'd would have probably sucked this down way faster than I did. Overall another great beer from Maine Beer Company.","dciBA","Beers"
4.87,16,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a Maine Beer Company logo glass. The beer has a very dark amber color; it looks nearly brown in this dimly lit room. The head is large, tan colored, and made up of various sizes of bubbles. There is some patchy lacing. The aroma is very impressive. One whiff and I exclaimed aloud "wow!" It smells of very fresh hops. There is almost a toasted quality to the hops that I haven't come across before. The bottle I have is super-fresh (bought today, delivered to the store earlier in the week, most likely bottled late last week), which must improve the aroma a lot. The flavor is just as impressive as the aroma; actually, I find it to be even more complex. It started out with a toasted flavor. It makes me imagine burnt embers leftover after a campfire. The hops kick in quickly. They are big, bitter and floral. The bitterness lends itself to the toasted aroma and initial flavor, perfectly complimenting the aroma. The is just a bit of sweetness in the mix. It lingers on, along with the bitterness, but last longer, which gives the sensation that the beer gets sweeter after you swallow it. After a few sips, the sides of my mouth felt a slight tug. The bitterness provides the slightest amount of puckering. The beer has a lighter body than I expected. There is plenty of carbonation in each swallow. As I mentioned above, the sweetness lingers on; this is through the coating. The beer goes down so easily. I can feel its strength slightly; after a few rounds this may become a problem. I don't believe that the hops/bitter tastes will ever get overpowering. I could drink this beer all night. I feel so lucky that this beer is brewed and sold so close by. Maine Beer Company have outdone themselves.","ToasterChef","0"
