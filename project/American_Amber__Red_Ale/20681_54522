I don't usually buy Maine Beer Co bottles, though, because their high pricepoint makes them linger on shelves and I'm just not gonna spend 50 cents an ounce on stale beer.  ","mynie","Link",

The taste was expertly balanced with piney hops coming through and then a bit of the sweet malt. The finish was very clean with a citrus finish that left you wanting another sip. Loved this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 31, 2015",
