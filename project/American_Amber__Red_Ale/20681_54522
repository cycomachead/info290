One of the most aggressively hoppy reds I've ever come across, and while it was enjoyable the lack of balance holds it back.","mynie","Friday at 11:02 AM"

The taste was expertly balanced with piney hops coming through and then a bit of the sweet malt. The finish was very clean with a citrus finish that left you wanting another sip. Loved this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 24, 2015"

Nose carried a nice amount of hops and an earthiness, which I mention in the taste on the backend. Finishes crisp and virtually no sweetness hanging around on the tongue despite just a bit in this well balanced taste. Really a great beer that I would not have thought twice about had I not been drawn to check out everything they have because of the Lunch and Dinner craze.","gopens44","0"
