3.98,3.4,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint.  Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine two finger light khaki head with good retention and heavy lacing. Aroma of caramel male, citrus and piney hops. Flavor is piney, lightly resinous hops with light citrus, mildly caramel malt with some biscuit; finishes with pine resin, citrus rind and black pepper. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A quite hop forward amber ale, but the resinous hops are well supported by the malt and the peppery finish is great. Sessionable ambers are not one of my go to styles, but this is quite nice and I'd have it again if it wasn't being discontinued. Glad I got to try it while it still is around, it is very flavorful and hoppy for its ABV.","LiquidAmber","Mar 11, 2015"
4.65,20.8,4,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"This is probably my favorite amber ale.  It's a shame it's being discontinued.  Wonderful citrusy aroma and very nicely balanced.  It has a much bigger body than many of the numerous new session ipas around these days.  I guess it's designation as an amber sealed it's fate.  I rate my beers by style, and I think this is as good as it gets in this category.","heerboth","Mar 10, 2015"

3.7,-3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a nice clear red body with a half finger of bubbly off-white head. Quite nice looking, a good amber ale. Scents of piney, grassy hops, earthy, dank hops, moderate toasted malt and light amounts of grainy malt and caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a rather hop forward amber ale, quite unbalanced and very much a Stone version of the style. Flavor begins quite bitter, following the aroma with pine resin and grassy herbal hop flavors mingling with toasted malt and a very faint presence of caramel. Middle continues to be bitter with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, grassy hops and light amounts of toasted malt and caramel in the background, very faintly discernible. Finish is dry with notes of pine resin, bitter floral and herbal hops and grapefruit peel. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and light cracker-like malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a rather bitter amber ale, balanced very much towards the hops with just enough malt to provide some basic semblance of balance. Not horrible, but a bit simple. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a resinous, drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a drying beer that urges you to drink more. Overall this is alright for an amber. I feel it is a bit too hoppy at the expense of other flavors and comes across as unbalanced even in comparison to other hoppy ambers such as Marble's. Not bad, but lacking.","Auraan","Feb 14, 2015"

While I wouldn't reach for this all the time, it serves as an absolutely perfect beer for BBQs, game night, or just any night when you're looking for great hop flavors in a beer that doesn't weigh you down too much.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 17, 2014"

As the flavor was ok and the smell and appearance were really nice, I felt that this beer was way too carbonated. I do not see a dateon the bottle so I do not know how fresh or how old this is. Too much carbonation spoiled the overall flavor but still a decent beer. As far as the Stone beers I have tried, this one is on the bottom of the list","hophugger","Jul 13, 2014"

The flavor is more tropical fruit hop forward with caramel malt. While there is a long,yet mild hop fade there is more of a caramel malt aftertaste. The body is lighter and yet lightly sticky and moderately carbonated. I think it must be due to the lighter ABV.","Franziskaner","Jun 20, 2014"

The aroma is more subtle than I've come to expect from Stone but delicious none the less. There is a lot of sweet malts on the nose with an underlying hoppy bitterness, mostly citrus and pine. The flavor is quite sweet at first with lots of malt and caramel notes this is followed by a bit of a bitter hop bite that resolves to a nicely balanced finish. The ale sips quite light and easy, almost too much so. I'd honestly like a little more coating and lasting flavor with this one. This is a nice amber/red ale but nowhere near the best of the offerings out there.","lochef81","Mar 10, 2014"

This offers a good smattering of flavors, with some uumph from the hops and malt flavors that don't back down, but it's not nearly as flavorful as I hoped. Worse, the mouthfeel is too thin. Overall, the beer lacks a solid body and distinctive flavors. It would have been nice to find a fairly low ABV beer out there that offers what the higher ABV beers bring to the table, but this one doesn't.","DeFaz","Dec 27, 2013"

Leaves lots of lacing when sipped. The aroma is mostly of hoppy grains. the taste was pretty much the same with a hint of some dark fruit. A bitter aftertaste hits you right up front from the hops. Does linger around until the next sip. LOL!","BeerWithMike","Nov 01, 2013"

For a Red Ale they use a lot of hops but I really appreciate it. It's a pretty complex beer, good combination of both malt and hop. Has a slight oily mouthfeel. Overall a great brew with high drinkability because of the low ABV and the amazing taste.","memphischas","Jul 18, 2013"

Chewy with a presence of dextrins, but light enough to never coat and always deliver with that spiky carb and gentle hop oiliness on the tongue. American hop heaven for a lighter early evening opener. Magically drinkable. Exceptional stuff, certainly deserving of all the accolades.","thecheapies","May 01, 2013"

Citrus is the predominant flavor and it is all I can do to savor and enjoy it. It's sort of like a SNPA.

4.14,7.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a light caramel red. The body is incredibly clear and free of sediment, and the head of the beer is light and soapy white, but bubbles away quickly to leave a light scrim and some thin wavy lacing on the glass. The beer smells terrifically big and bitter, with gushes of pine, citrus, and a light note of juicy mango mingling with the candy caramel malts beneath the hops. It smells tremendously hoppy for a 4.4% Amber Ale, which is what Stone bills it as, personally, thought, I see this beer as a sessionable IPA with a darker body. Stone calls it an amber ale though, and honestly, style doesn’t really matter. There is a nice resiny touch to the smell of the beer when agitated, which further marks this beer as an IPA to me. On the palate, this beer continues the IPA trend. The beer begins with light bitter pine before opening into big bitter citrus with a sweet caramel traveling beneath the hops and balancing this beer beautifully. For all its bitter flavor, this is a lighter beer that finds a beautiful balance with the light alcohol and malts keeping the hops to a comfortable and thirst quenching bitter bite and enough flavor for you to compete with beers far bigger than it. The finish of the beer is bitter and full of hints of grapefruit and light cereal malts. On the mouth, this beer feels light to medium in body with a nice little fizzle from the carbonation, which smoothes the beer onto the tongue, leaving the mouth with a very thin sheen of cool spittle, and a light dry bitter lingering in the mouth. It is actually quite refreshing in feeling, which may stem from its lower alcohol percentage. Overall this is a superb beer. Its hugely hoppy, yet balanced, yet completely sessionable. Stone has really done something neat with this beer, and I really hope that others continue to follow suit because this is something I could sip all day and it would not make me fall over at the end of the day. A session beer for the hop heads, and a delicious success for Stone. It is a little too hop-forward for me to consider it an amber/red ale, but really that’s just semantics. The beer is good. Drink it.","Maxwell","Dec 28, 2012"

The taste is very mild and leans more toward the hoppy side for an amber ale. Light bodied with a bitter, somewhat roasty finish. A bit unbalanced I think as the bitterness is a little dominant and I don't pick up any malt sweetness at all. Still, very drinkable and a good session option for sure.","Braz","Dec 22, 2012"

Flavor is yummy english like malts and plenty of citrusy hops. The citrus cannot be understated in this one for me - it's really on the back end when I breath: nice orange rinds with some hints of grapefruit. The malts are pekoe in character.

3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 7/9/2012. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice rings spotty lacing cling to the glass as you drink. Aromas of caramel, orange zest, grapefruit, mango, floral, pine, herbal, pineapple, and toast. Pretty nice and well balanced aromas; but a bit muted. Taste of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, caramel, pine, herbal, floral, and toast. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, herbal, caramel, and toast on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop flavors with caramel malt sweetness; almost perfect contrast. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is not really noticed at all, as expected for 4.4%. Overall this is a very nice amber ale! Very flavorful and balanced; and extremely easy drinking of course. If I am looking for a nice session beer I would not pass this up.","superspak","Jul 08, 2012"

It’s well-balanced like a good amber ale should be, but it’s somewhat confusing because the nose was more hop-heavy while the taste was more malt-heavy. It’s also a little on the lighter side in terms of body, but that kind of makes sense considering the low ABV. Despite these characteristics, this is a really nice session beer.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption as well as a light cap of lacing. The aroma of piney hops is strong. There are also citrus and malt aromas as well. It's a very earthy smell. The big hop flavors hit up front to perfectly support the mild malt flavors. The citrus and sweetness are subdued, but present. It's incredibly well balanced. There is a slight bitter aftertaste. The body to this beer is actually surprisingly quite light, though it would be more light to medium. The carbonation is not strong, but this beer is still very easy to drink. Overall, this is another solid offering from Stone. It's a sessionable hop forward ale.","acevenom","Apr 20, 2012"

We must have fallen off the trail somewhere between the nose and the mouth. The flavors were flat throughout, and the heavy bitterness made the taste seem detached from what was set up for by the aroma. Additionally, there was a flattish feel to the palate, leaving not only the taste buds board, but the mouth bored as well.","TheBrewo","Jan 30, 2012"

Smell had hints of pine and citrus. Taste was refreshingly good. Nice level of hops for an amber. Enough hops to notice, but not overly hopped like some West Coast beers. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a balanced dose of malt to give it some body. I guess the one thing that surprised me was the low abv. Seeing this now as I review it, I would have never guessed Stone made this beer so low. Didn't taste like a session beer.

4.08,6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"I think this beer may be one of the best introductory beers out there to introduce non craft drinkers to the world of craft beer. The low(er) alcohol percentage is a rarity for Stone, and I don't feel they skimp on the taste at all, despite it being the alcohol content that the average beer consumer would be used to. It's hoppy, but well balanced. The style is one that the average beer consumer has probably had before, but this is a good, well hopped up version, and still contains all the signifying traits that make up Stone. Great for a session beer. Overall I think this is a beer to bring the average consumer and a craft drinker together and see common ground. I see it as being a big success for that reason.","ely2000k","Dec 10, 2011"

A sharp hop bite that quickly moves to some tasty roasted caramel and bready malts before a quick dose of some citrus hops that really brings it full circle. Gives it a nice bitter finish. Full-bodied and a little thick and fizzy on the palate, this beer makes me think more of a well-balanced Pale Ale rather than an Amber but pretty damn good nonetheless.","nimrod979","Nov 17, 2011"

It's still a pretty good beer, and it still have about a week to go until its Best by date (yeah, not the freshest but it's better than it being well past), and I could see this being a great transition into IPAs given the lower ABV and IBU and cleaner feel.","nhindian","Nov 15, 2011"

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into standard pint, levitation is a deep red, clear ale, with a wispy, modest creamy head lingering on top. Earthy, citrusy hops hang over top of a sweet, slightly roasty malt aroma. A taste reveals much of what the aroma suggests: grapefruit, bitter, biting citrus hops on top of a firm malty base. A very slight roasted malt character is present. Nice medium/full body for a lower gravity beer, with moderate carbonation that compliments it very nicely. This beer is quite drinkable overall, and seems as though it would be a hophead's "session beer". It has a lot of the bold characteristics of a big hoppy beer, but keeps it in control with a lower alcohol content. Very nice beer. If you like hops, give it a shot.","Finn","Nov 15, 2011"

Strong citrus hop aromas make this smell like an IPA. From the scent, I'm expecting a very hoppy taste. It is highly hopped relative to the style, but the malt character comes through strongest with bread and caramel flavors. There is a nice surge of piney hops in the finish. The complex flavors all balance together very nicely. Mouthfeel seemed a little thin. Very drinkable and enjoyable.","DeltaGolfSierra","Nov 09, 2011"

I could drink this all day, and at 4.4% it's one of the best session beers I've had. I just wish it wasn't so expensive for a six pack.

I even cut the beer off early. The color is a nice rich red with good off-white head that is lacing. The smell includes some spice and bitter citrus. The taste is a great blend of malt with hops that cleans and tingle the pallate. The mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation and good balance.

3.93,2.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours reddish-brown with at least a finger of head that maintains well. The smell is reminiscent of a West Coast pale ale - some citrus and nicely hoppy. The flavor is bold for a beer with such low alcohol. It has a pleasant hop finish as well. This beer is a gem for sessioning with craft brew friends or to pair with everyday meals. It would also be great for a party where most guests were not craft brew enthusiasts.","57md","Oct 01, 2011"

3.65,-5.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Happy to run into a Stone take over at DeCicco’s in Brewster, NY, this brew shows a dark mahogany color, semi-translucent with a decent tannish froth on top and good lacing. The aroma is a nice citrus brightness with earthy pine and subtle flowery sweetness. The taste is very bitter, raw grass and subtle pine with lots of biscuit and some caramel malt. It’s peppery with crisp carbonation and a fairly aggressive effervescent feel. But it is a little thinner than I expected. Medium light bodied at best. Medium drinkability. Decent but a bit harsh for the style.","Durge","Sep 24, 2011"

It looks stunning (OK, I just happen to love this color)! Aroma of grapefruit hops and caramel malt. Flavor similar to aroma. While it leans toward the hoppy side, it has a nice caramel backbone. It's light bodied, has a smooth mouth feel, and is very drinkable. For a 4.4% ABV brew, the aptly named Levitation packs in a lot of flavor and makes for a very sessionable beer.","notsoprobeer","Sep 21, 2011"

The beer poured out as a nice looking amber color with a decent white colored head on it with a good lacing also. The smell of the beer is malty, much more malty than most stone brew that I'm aware of. The taste of the brew does have a good hoppiness to it along with some nice caramel flavors too.

Smells strongly of hops and an earthy malty aroma. Taste is really good for the style and ABV. I'm not a huge fan of ambers but at 4.4% and a good dose of hops, this is going to be a new standard. Hops aren't as strong in the taste as the smell, and the mouthfeel is a little thin, but that's expected.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Dark amber body, multiple streams of carbonation rising up side of glass. Big hop aroma especially for the style, piney goodness, balanced by caramel malt sweetness. Taste is pretty sweet up front, leading to a quite bitter finish for the style. Mouthfeel is medium, good effervescence, and fairly dry finish. I used this as a palate awakener and while the patrons who don't enjoy fairly hoppy beers were in flux there were a number of return tasters. A fairly unique Amber, one of the hoppier examples of the style ala Troegs. At this ABV extremely drinkable. Worth a try, especially for those looking for a hoppy session beer.","jdense","Aug 14, 2011"

I was surprised to find out that it was a red ale, because drinking it from the bottle in the hotel room it had more of the taste characteristics of a pale ale. Oh well, hop head will rejoice in the red ale. An all around very good beer that packs alot of flavor and mouthfeel into a beer with a modest alcohol content. A bit pricey for what it is, but certainly one of the better red ales i've had.","Bockrules","Aug 02, 2011"
3.58,-7,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a decent take on a Red/Amber. What makes me enjoy it is the fact that it's 4.4% ABV but still relatively flavorful. Definitely a good beer for someone looking for a bit of a hop fix on a hot summer day.","ms11781","Jul 31, 2011"
3.93,2.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Levitation ale is a very enjoyable beer that is a bit confusing to me, but tasty none the less.

3.42,-11.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"It poured a hazy medium brown that supported a large light brown rocky head that was bellowing above the top of the glass. It dissipated at a rapid pace leaving just a little residue behind, although it was enough for some really excellent lacing. The aroma was unusually complex with a mild scent of toasted malts, a nice dose of piney hops and an earthy yeast with hints of sweet fruit, honey and a nice citrus note. The taste had kind of a sweet-acidic flavor with a slight fruity note from the onset. Then it slowly but firmly became extremely bitter with a nice strong hop presence and a touch of citrus at the end. Mouthfeel was somewhere between light and medium in body and nice and dry in texture with a subtle soft carbonation. Overall a unique tasting brew that was very enjoyable. A must try for a Hop Head.","KajII","Jul 25, 2011"

It’s truly amazing that Stone packed this much flavor into this type of package. Most of the time session beers can come across as bland, watery, and without much in the way of flavor. With Levitation, Stone has turned that assumption on its ear, creating a full-flavored Pale Ale / IPA / Red Ale beer that doesn’t have that huge ABV punch. Over the years the boys in Escondido have produced a number of extraordinary beers that I’ve enjoyed, but quite honestly Levitation may be the best of the bunch.","eclaycamp","Jul 23, 2011"

The smell of this beer is light at first, but as the beer warms a little you get light citrus and grapefruit tones from the dry hopping. Thanks to the dry hopping, the hops are forward on the drink but quickly allow the malts to take center stage. The beer finishes clear and dry with a resurgence of the hops on the swallow. To me, this is a San Diego-West Coast take on an American amber ale. There's a lot more of a hop profile, which can be refreshing for hop heads looking for a break from the IPA norm at the bar. This is also a great starter beer.","jmvecchio1","Jul 16, 2011"

Righteous stinky hops on the nose with a big caramel malt backing. Smells much like an APA or an IPA.

When held up to light it shines a beautiful redish hue. Head is a nice tan hue and about one finger tall, retention is pretty decent and it slowly dissipates to a splotchy foam atop my beer. Smell is of caramel malt, also I smell some grassy hops. Taste is thinner than I expected considering the color and fullness of the smell. The beer hits the tongue with a taste of light malts, then it fades into some hops. Aftertaste is slightly piney and bitter. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, it seems a little bit watery, but I have to remind myself this is a session beer, not a double IPA.

3.77,-2.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Stone Levitation Ale pours a big stiff head over a clear burnt orange brew. Carbonation is spritzy, and the nose is bright, spicy, resinous, marmelade hops. The hop-forward theme carries through to the flavor- hoppy hoppy hoppy and a little oily, almost, up front, with barley hulls and nutty notes off the back. Mouthfeel is light, with a long grassy hop aftertaste.

In the mouth, the bready and nutty note is foremost, but as that fades a nice, big pine bitterness hangs around for a long while.

Hops up front fresh cut grass and sour apple with a malty middle that has a dry hoppy finish.

Toasted malt and some caramel malt held their own against the hops profile that sported elements of grapefruit, light pine and some grass. Hints of butter also appeared as it warmed up. Very tame compared to most stone beers and quite accessible. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation appropriate and the body medium. Very drinkable for a Stone beer but not as impressive as their usual offerings.","thekevlarkid","Jan 04, 2011"

3.94,2.3,3,4,4,4,4,"Poured on tap at the Stone Brewery into a pint glass, the beer is a light cloudy brown color with no head. The beer has a nutty-malt nose; very aromatic. First sip gives a malty-hop punch in the face of flavor, which is unexpected, but very welcome. There are nutty undertones to the flavor, as well. The beer's flavors are very well balanced. The beer is smooth and crisp in mouth, and there is a hops aftertaste to the finish. Very drinkable beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 02, 2011"

Aroma is on point with what I am looking for in a red ale. Has a solid hop prescence with some nice caramelized malts and a spicy herbal note. Has a grate malty hop taste that I can't believe come s from such a low abv brew. Caramel, spice, pine and vanilla come through. Perfect carbonation as it is low or at least has silky sewer bubbles.

The smell is west coast hops with a bit of a bready grain malt in the background maybe a bit weak overall. The taste matches the smell. A fair dose of hops come to the forefront with a decent backing of bread and grain. The malt character is a bit one dimensional and maybe a bit thin for the amount of hop in this beer, given the style.

Finishes smooth and a bit sweet, kind of dry, but not as much as I'd expect. I'm missing some malt in this beer, though. This is an impressive stab at a lower alcohol amber ale, for sure, but it tastes like a low body ale that's disguised by a ton of hopping and dry-hopping. A quality brew, but I'd rather reach for something else if I'm in need of a lighter beer. It's just too "thin."","sixerofelixir","Jun 22, 2010"

At first, the bitter-sweet character is balanced, with light sweetness and bitterness, but the bitterness soon takes over a little too much by the finish and lingers. The finish is lightly bitter with strong grapefruit & faint orange zest. An aftertaste of lightly bitter grapefruit and faint toasted grain follows. The feel is rather thin like mineral water, the character is thin, one-dimensionally grapefruity-orange-zesty hops with nothing to balance. It promptly reveals itself to be superficial in taste/character and lacking complexity. What character it does have is fairly strong, holding up well, so this would be fairly good to have with some mild foods, but drinkability is not very high despite the lower ABV.","Offa","Oct 20, 2009"

That is followed by the grass and pine flavors, bringing a tobacco flavor at the end. A strong grassy hop flavor lingers, long after each taste. A medium bodied feel, that gradually gains weight slightly, finishes with mild dryness. This may be the most hop flavored session beer I have had, period.

I like that Stone is selling a low abv beer, and they're doing a pretty good job at packing a big flavor into a little beer. However, something about the combination of citric hops and spicy caramel malt doesn't really work for me. The beer pours a medium mahogany with a nice head that laces the glass well. The aroma is heavy on American hops with a good grapefruit flavor. There's also a very nice, light caramel malt note. I love good session beers, but this one doesn't quite come together. The flavors just seem at odds with each other on the palate. Carbonation is good, and the beer is otherwise well-crafted. It really comes down to some kind of ethereal, entirely subjective reaction. I think that I'm mostly reacting to the malt choices, but it could be anything. So, I'd recommend this beer, but I'm also not going to go out and buy it for myself.","popery","Sep 29, 2009"

Nice brown to copper in the glass, with some rising bubbles visible. Decent, tan colored head that stayed through the first few sips and laced the glass nicely. Hint of light biscuity malt in the nose, but the taste matched with a nicely balanced malt and notable hops bitterness that made your mouth water from first sip. The flavor wasn't complex in the sense that it changed or shifted, but it was consistently well balanced and flavorful, with the nice bitter kick at the end. Nothing cloying or "sweet" or fruity about it. A definite session beer. Light mouthfeel and carbonation only added to the refreshing nature of the beer; and since it was just 4.4%, it was easily quaffed and enjoyed. Definitely a unique Ale.

Nice scent, very bitter with some nice citrus and floral American hops, but with little of the nice sweet, clean red ale scent I expected to go with it. Nice hoppy, pale-ale-type flavor, nice American hops, with enough malt to keep it near to balanced; much hoppier than a regular red ale, but that was what they were going for. Goes down fine, if a little rough from the slight unbalanced aspect. Pretty darn hoppy for such a low ABV red ale.","JamesS","Jul 17, 2009"

The smell is almost pure Amarillo on my end. There are resins, quite a bit of grapefruit, but the pungent smells are almost leafy, grassy, and earthy. Way more in the smell than you would expect from a 4.4% beer. Though there isn't as much of a malt presence from an Amber ale, a bit of some toasty sweetness though. Still, I'm exited to taste after smelling. The taste starts out a little toasty, but become very heavy on the breadiness, with a nice kick of caramel sweetness. A lot more malt body to this than in the smell. There are tons of sticky resins, which combined with the smell, suggests that there is quite a bit of dry-hopping going on in this beer. There's a nice bit of orange juice sweetness thanks the the malt combining with the hops, but a great balance and fairly low bitterness. The mouthfeel is just great for such low ABV. It's quite full, without ever being too sweet. And I just love the resnious feel. This one is a great American session beer. Not as low in ABV as some of its British counterparts, but still very impressive. The flavor entirely delivers, and deceives you into thinking you're drinking something much stronger. You have to love a beer like this. I know I do.","taylorhamrick","Jun 27, 2009"

Lightest gauziness, otherwise clear in spite of the darkness of the amber red color, more burnt orange around the rims. not a lot of visible carbonation. Dry nose, some pumpernickel but more like dried cake, the caramel and toffee fade in favor of pine, mixed white citrus and crushed flowers, not much by way of fruit scents, overall dryness contributes to increasing perception of grassiness. Medium-bodied, very persistent prickle to the carbonation, almost like fine sandpaper. More of a scone, muffin or biscuit sort of sweetness, the malts don't take hold deeply, you get caramel, mocha powder and a light glazed thing but it's really a showcase for the grapefruit, lemon citrus, pine, hay, metallic tap water stuff.

Functionally this is sort of like low ABV IPA. I really enjoyed putting back a few of these with some buddies last night and I think it's even better revisiting it tonight.

Extremely sessionable and unique ale but the nose leads you to believe it may be more complex than it ends up being.","DiabolikDUB","May 20, 2009"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark amber copper color, relatively clear, consistent carbonation. Moderate, frothy butter colored head that diminishes to a thin film with thick sticky rings of lacing. Aroma is...light? Not in a bad way, has a strong hop aroma and malty background, but nothing is overwhelming. Light body with heavy carbonation and a strong hop bite in the finish. Taste has backbone of caramel malt and a very dry hop bite that lingers forever. Entirely different hoppy amber than say Nugget Nectar, this is much thinner and lacking something in the body. Not even really so much an amber or a pale, just seems like a missing body with a hoppy kick. That isn't to say this isn't a nice session beer but it pales when compared to other Stone beers or others in the hoppy amber category.","yourefragile","May 20, 2009"

Hops dominate the flavor as well, with bright, lemon/pine bitterness. The malt body is delicate with hints of bread and dough, which soften as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is light and thin, but not watery. Finishes very clean with lasting hop bitterness. Similar to an English bitter, but with American hop flare. Delicious session beer. One of the best sub-5% abv beers out there, but must be consumed fresh... I imagine the bright hops would dull quickly in this.","bcm119","May 17, 2009"

Be it "American Amber Ale" or "English Premium Bitter with a US twist", this proves to be one of the most quaffable and lovely hoppy beers that I've had recently. I'm really happy to have tried it, but I uphold my opinion: "Better serve it cool"!

Pours a deep auburn amber with foamy light-tan head. Looks like iced tea or such. Taste is, as you may expect, like a lighter verysion of their ipa.. its not thin by any means, just lighter with a touch of hops and a deep amber-type base. Mouth feels quite light.. The mouth and drinkability are like a light beer, sort of, but just with a decent hop character.

This is basically a sessionable Arrogant Bastard at 4.4% ABV that you could drink right out of the bottle and not feel the least bit bad about it.

Beauty. More of a bittery resiny hop in the flavor, some grapefruit. A weakish caramel malt struggles to support the bitter hop flavor. The body feels a bit thin, almost watery. I was expecting a bigger body but at 4.4%ABV I guess that is a trade off. The carbonation is on the softer side; finishes a tad bitter. A fantastic smelling brew that slides in taste and feel.

Stones beer continue to disappoint me.","bowersdm","Feb 05, 2009"

3.97,3.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, best by 4/9/09. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with a half-inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are both average. It smells like piney and grassy hops, along with a little bit of malt. Taste is the same as the aroma, pine and grassy hops with a bit of malt. There's also a nice lingering hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, I think it's a decent choice as a session beer. I didn't know what to think of this beer at first, a Stone beer at just 4.4% ABV? The flavor is good and it's easy to drink, so that's definitely a good thing. But for the price I don't think I'm getting my money's worth.

I am upgrading my 3.5 for smell to a 4.5 for the balanced complexity of the nose of this beer. It smells inviting and interesting. I am upgrading the taste from a 4.0 to a 4.5 since this is a really nicely balanced beer with a hops kick, not the hops centric beer that it sounds like I describe above. I am upgrading the mouthfeel from 3.0 to 4.0 since this is a big, almost sugary balanced beer with plenty going on to keep my interest.

Although there's not a much malt as I'd expect from this style it was still great. Nice caramel malt backbone with a good hops kick at the end.

This increadible beer begins with a deep amber / nearly brown hue with creamy off-white head formation, retains very well, and leaves lacing all over the place. Modest carbonation gives the beer a cask ale-like demeanor. Sharp aromas of pine and citrus hops promises agression, while very light notes of nuts, toast, and cocoa tells me that the beer isn't only hops. The taste of the hops hit up front with a juicy burst citurs, then pine. After the hops die down a bit, the dry toast, chesnut, and light cocoa powder flavors come in. Interestingly, there are no real sweetness to this beer- it has fully attenuated so that only the dry malt, hops, and fermentation character shows. The mouthfeel is both creamy and dry, making it very drinkable, albeit bitter. Finishes with a crisp bitterness- part from hops, but part from toast and nuttiness. This beer has a lot of character for a 4.4% sessionable, bone-dry beer. A pleasure to drink, but a bit of sweetness would have scored it higher.","BEERchitect","Jun 27, 2008"

Instead of a Stone IPA with citrusy aromas and flavors and and golden color, this is more like HopDevil or something of that sort. Great deep amber color, nice snappy head. Stinky hop aroma, sharp bitter hop bite, good mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability. A bit rougher than the Stone IPA, like a brasher and more unpredictable younger brother. High IBU's with low ABV makes this a hophead's session ale.","sacrelicio","Aug 22, 2007"

There was a great color and body to this brew, lighter brownish red, with aromas of caramel malts, some unripe fruits and extremely clean hops- I love stone's hops- theyre very unique among all of the other hop-bomb breweries. Flavor was light and subtle- raw leaf hops, citrus and piney, so fresh I feel like im eating them straight off the plant. There is some malt there to balance everything out, but it definitely plays second to the hops. Very reminiscent of their stronger brews, but this one leaves your taste buds intact and with a lower ABV you can drink more than a couple- ill be purchasing this one as go-to from now on.","kernalklink","Aug 19, 2007"

There was a pleasant caramel aroma that balanced the hops, which were a bit fruity, but mostly herbal, grassy, and woody. Solid bitterness with an herbal, minty hop flavour. Toasty malt gave a light sweetness and there was some fruitiness in the background as well. Nice balance. Medium/light body and carbonation, quite refreshing.

Smell was soft and hop forward with metal, citrus, and almost the smell of wet dirt (just before it becomes mud). Mouthfeel was ok, dry and lackluster. Taste was somewhat of a mouthfull. Blast of hops on the tongue mellowed slightly by caramel, stale bread, and citrus. Pretty bitter ending, not hops bitter ...

This poured a dark amber with a fat, slightly off-white head that left sticky-looking lacing in rings around the glass. Nose of malts, hops, citrus, flowers, and something else I cannot quite get to. The hops dominate and so you have to look for everything else. Mouthfeel is very smooth and better than most ambers. Flavor is of malts, caramels, and of course hops. Finishes smooth .

The mouthfeel is thin for obvious reasons, but I still really dig this beer. The complexity they managed to squeeze out of a beer with 4.4% abv is pretty astonishing.

As a departure from some of Stones other brews the malts provide most of the flavor and aroma but the hops, which hang low aromatically, balance the abundant malts well.

Pine resin, oak, and citrus hops greet you initially, followed by a solid middle that I found a little lacking in the malt promised by the aroma. It is not sweet, but rather bitter.

A nice malty, fruity aroma laced with some hops greets the nose. Very inviting. The taste is surprisingly bitter, considering the hops played a supporting role in the aroma. Some roasted malt and caramel notes come thorugh after a few sips, with a touch of sweetness playing on the tongue in between slaps of hoppy bitterness. A touch of pine, some saopiness, and a dab of citrus all dance around, overpowering the malt. Slightly unbalanced, but still enjoyable. As the beer warms (or as my tastebuds get seduced by the hops) the malt comes through better and the beer shows better balance. The mouthfeel is lighter, but smooth. The carbonation is perfectly done. Not noticeably harsh, yet not flat either. And the drinkability is superb. This has a lot of Stone's signature attributes, yet can be consumed on a regular basis for the duration of the evening. And most beer drinkers would still not be worthy of this beer.

3.2,-16.9,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"It looks much like many APAs on the market:  brownish-red with an off-white head that dimishes but sticks on top to the end.  The smell is pretty much all hops with just a trace of malt sweetness and slight notes of citrus.  The taste is almost all hop bitterness.  I kept searching for more as I emptied the glass but was left disappointed.  It tastes like someone was making a pale ale and accidentally dropped in a triple dose of hops.  Any underlying flavors disappear almost on hitting the mouth.  Even at 4.4%, I'd have a hard time putting away more than two of these in a sitting.","mickeymac","Oct 20, 2002"
4.13,7.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Charged with anticipation, I eagerly went out and grabbed this on the first day that it was (truly) available here in Arizona. After I pour, I observe a mouth-watering amber colored brew with a cream-colored head that thins, but stays at just the right level, leaving scattered lace. I soak in the aroma, which is huge, as can always be expected from a Stone brew. Juicy citrus and Christmas tree hops and caramel maltiness combine for a wonderful and unique aroma. I take the highly anticipated first sip, and discover a suberbly balanced malt and hop profile, consisting of citrus and rind-like bitterness, which make the aforementioned Christmas tree-like character, along with caramel and grainy malt character. Bitterness leaves a unique impression in the middle of the palate. Hops also provide a nice and sharp bite. A crisp and satisfying flavorful brew.","hyuga","Oct 09, 2002"
