Okay beer.  More of a porter than a red ale.  A little watered down but decent.","jngrizzaffi","Mar 24, 2015",

"3.98","+3.4%","4","4","4","3.75","4","Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint.  Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine two finger light khaki head with good retention and heavy lacing. Aroma of caramel male, citrus and piney hops. Flavor is piney, lightly resinous hops with light citrus, mildly caramel malt with some biscuit; finishes with pine resin, citrus rind and black pepper. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A quite hop forward amber ale, but the resinous hops are well supported by the malt and the peppery finish is great. Sessionable ambers are not one of my go to styles, but this is quite nice and I'd have it again if it wasn't being discontinued. Glad I got to try it while it still is around, it is very flavorful and hoppy for its ABV.","LiquidAmber","Mar 16, 2015",

It has a much bigger body than many of the numerous new session ipas around these days.  I guess it's designation as an amber sealed it's fate.  I rate my beers by style, and I think this is as good as it gets in this category.","heerboth","Mar 14, 2015",
