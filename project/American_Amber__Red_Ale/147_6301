"3.98","+3.4%","4","4","4","3.75","4","Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint.  Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine two finger light khaki head with good retention and heavy lacing. Aroma of caramel male, citrus and piney hops. Flavor is piney, lightly resinous hops with light citrus, mildly caramel malt with some biscuit; finishes with pine resin, citrus rind and black pepper. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A quite hop forward amber ale, but the resinous hops are well supported by the malt and the peppery finish is great. Sessionable ambers are not one of my go to styles, but this is quite nice and I'd have it again if it wasn't being discontinued. Glad I got to try it while it still is around, it is very flavorful and hoppy for its ABV.","LiquidAmber","Mar 11, 2015"

It has a much bigger body than many of the numerous new session ipas around these days.  I guess it's designation as an amber sealed it's fate.  I rate my beers by style, and I think this is as good as it gets in this category.","heerboth","Mar 10, 2015"

"3.7","-3.9%","4","4","3.5","4","3.5","Poured a nice clear red body with a half finger of bubbly off-white head. Quite nice looking, a good amber ale. Scents of piney, grassy hops, earthy, dank hops, moderate toasted malt and light amounts of grainy malt and caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a rather hop forward amber ale, quite unbalanced and very much a Stone version of the style. Flavor begins quite bitter, following the aroma with pine resin and grassy herbal hop flavors mingling with toasted malt and a very faint presence of caramel. Middle continues to be bitter with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, grassy hops and light amounts of toasted malt and caramel in the background, very faintly discernible. Finish is dry with notes of pine resin, bitter floral and herbal hops and grapefruit peel. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and light cracker-like malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a rather bitter amber ale, balanced very much towards the hops with just enough malt to provide some basic semblance of balance. Not horrible, but a bit simple. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a resinous, drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a drying beer that urges you to drink more. Overall this is alright for an amber. I feel it is a bit too hoppy at the expense of other flavors and comes across as unbalanced even in comparison to other hoppy ambers such as Marble's. Not bad, but lacking.","Auraan","Feb 14, 2015"

While I wouldn't reach for this all the time, it serves as an absolutely perfect beer for BBQs, game night, or just any night when you're looking for great hop flavors in a beer that doesn't weigh you down too much.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 17, 2014"

Too much carbonation spoiled the overall flavor but still a decent beer. As far as the Stone beers I have tried, this one is on the bottom of the list","hophugger","Jul 13, 2014"

Aroma of caramel and tropical fruit scented hops. The flavor is more tropical fruit hop forward with caramel malt. While there is a long,yet mild hop fade there is more of a caramel malt aftertaste. The body is lighter and yet lightly sticky and moderately carbonated. I think it must be due to the lighter ABV.","Franziskaner","Jun 20, 2014"

It does finally give way to a nice film and spiderweb lacing. The aroma is more subtle than I've come to expect from Stone but delicious none the less. There is a lot of sweet malts on the nose with an underlying hoppy bitterness, mostly citrus and pine. The flavor is quite sweet at first with lots of malt and caramel notes this is followed by a bit of a bitter hop bite that resolves to a nicely balanced finish. The ale sips quite light and easy, almost too much so. I'd honestly like a little more coating and lasting flavor with this one. This is a nice amber/red ale but nowhere near the best of the offerings out there.","lochef81","Mar 10, 2014"

This offers a good smattering of flavors, with some uumph from the hops and malt flavors that don't back down, but it's not nearly as flavorful as I hoped. Worse, the mouthfeel is too thin. Overall, the beer lacks a solid body and distinctive flavors. It would have been nice to find a fairly low ABV beer out there that offers what the higher ABV beers bring to the table, but this one doesn't.","DeFaz","Dec 27, 2013"

Pours a dark red copper with good retention. For a Red Ale they use a lot of hops but I really appreciate it. It's a pretty complex beer, good combination of both malt and hop. Has a slight oily mouthfeel. Overall a great brew with high drinkability because of the low ABV and the amazing taste.","memphischas","Jul 18, 2013"

Citrus is the predominant flavor and it is all I can do to savor and enjoy it. It's sort of like a SNPA.
