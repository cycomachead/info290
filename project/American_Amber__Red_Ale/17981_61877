Taste follows the nose, very well balanced, grassy & citrusy, sweet in the middle, yet finishes dry but I still get something slightly metallic at the end.  Feel is right where it should be for the style.  I like hoppy reds and overall this is super easy drinking and I enjoy it quite a bit.","adapt313","Mar 01, 2015"
