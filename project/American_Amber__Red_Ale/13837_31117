The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, moderate carbonation. Sweet citrus taste with notes of caramel and orange peel. Hop bitterness with some pine resin flavor kicks in just at the right time. It lingers into the finish. Very tasty amber ale.","jbaker67","Sep 07, 2013"

So it's more of a amber IPA which is more of my type of beer. Ambergeddon has a solid bitterness and enough malt underneath it to still feeel like an amber, just a hopped-up one.","Mdog","Sep 03, 2013"

My mouth wanted the citrus hop burst that the nose suggested, but it never happened. And the hop flavor that is presented has a reserved quality to it that isn't helped by the watery sensation of it. Overall, it has fairly decent balance of flavors and pretty nice complexity...I just wish the flavors were more pronounced.","DabblinWiscCraft","May 24, 2011"
"3.78","-4.3%","4.5","4","3.5","3.5","4","Dripping with hop flavor, the taste of Ambergeddon is well-balanced by nutty, almost husky malt grains. A flash of minerals hits mid-sip before a light, tingling bitterness graces the back of the palate. The flavors work well together, but something seems a bit muted about the whole experience. Mouthfeel is soft on the carbonation and thinner than expected for the style and ABV. I found this to be a decent Amber, but probably not something I'll be seeking out again. Still, I'd definitely buy it off the shelf if given the opportunity.","wagenvolks","May 20, 2011"

The malt smells biscuity and a hint sweet. It smells like an IPA. It's medium bodied and incredibly smooth with a very clean finish. I taste a lot of hops (simcoe?).

A nice white head 1-1.5 cm sits on top, which drops down to a dense little puck on top, leaving pretty good lacing. The smell is of toasty malts, a bit of caramel and toffee, some smells of lightly grassy hops, and I get some tart fruits, like cherries, oranges, and underripe magoes. The taste starts out with a little citrus peel bitterness, and it quickly turns into a dry, toasty breadiness, like crackers. Then it moves into a grassy, almost resinous taste as it goes down. I kind of expected more sweetness, but there's just enough to carry the flavor without the grassy taste getting out of hand. I like it. The hops contribute to the body, but it just doesn't quite do enough to help to forget about the slight watery feel to this. The carbonation is good though, zippy. And it actually warms me a little and kind of fills me up. The drinkability is good. You wouldn't think it was a 6.8%-er. Very pleasant and enjoyable at points, but it didn't quite blow me away.

"4","+1.3%","4","4","4","4","4","Pretty clear, reddish amber colour with a cap of thin beige foam. Some sticky lace and the fine bubbles stuck around once they settled to a collar. Fruity aroma, some orange and sweetness with caramel, slight alcohol. Floral notes too. Candy sweetness up front, fruity tangerine, bitterness appeared towards the end and was a little aggressive/sharp/piney. Alcohol and warmth appeared in the finish along with lingering, earthy bitterness. Medium bodied, good texture, a little creamy with average carbonation. Pretty good drinkability, not overly complex (didn't need to be), well made and tasty.","DrJay","0"

No aroma that I could detect. Taste was nicely balanced with hops and malt, and little more of the hops on the finish, which I liked. Light body with very little carbonation, but enough to keep it from seeming flat. A very drinkable beer.","BeerCheese","Nov 19, 2007"

"4.1","+3.8%","4","4","4","3","5","A very pleasant ruby red-amber color with a relatively brilliant finish, but a limited amount of carbonation, from the look of it. Aroma is what I think an amber ale should be - a nice blend of caramel and hoppiness bound together so thoroughly you can't really tell where one ends and the other begins. Flavor is pronounced hoppiness...not really true to style (IMO) but delicious nonetheless. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, like a pretty good IPA. I like this beer quite a bit.","BeerBelcher","Aug 13, 2007"

Very aggressive hop nose, citrus and grapefruit, and big sweet abundant malt as a base to the IPA level of hops. This amber beer with gold highlights looks good in the glass and disappeared quickly. Listed as American Amber, which it doesn't really fit but not sure if there's a style name for it yet--I've seen Imperial Red or Double Pale Ale on similar beer. Flying Dog Double Dog seems similar, and it becoming a favorite style of mine, whatever it is.","FightingEntropy","Jul 30, 2007"

"4.7","+19%","4.5","4.5","5","4.5","4.5","Pours an excellent orange and amber color with a big white head that left great lacing and retained very well. Smell is full of pungent grapefruit and citrus hops. The beer was poured cold into a regular pint glass, not exactly the best for accenting aromas, but it still had plenty of aroma coming right to me. Taste has a good malt background, even a touch of biscuit in there while still having the hops be the leaders. It was nice to be able to have a malt background and still be pummeled with hops, one of the hoppier beers I've had as of late. Higher than medium bodied with medium carbonation levels, just seemed to fit very well with this one. Very drinkable, I could drink this by the pitcher, and perhaps I'll just have to do that next time. Excellent beer here, this is worth seeking out.","badbeer","Nov 18, 2006"
"4.42","+11.9%","4","4.5","4.5","4","4.5","The crossed-pistols and single-gold-toothed skull on the black and gold label seem to imply a "take no prisoners" / "live life on your own terms" attitude, and the beer itself carries that message through. It's a hazy chestnut with glowing orange highlights beneath a frothy head of ivory. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves impressive lacing at the outset of the glass, followed by thin curtains of torn lace as you progress through the glass. Pungent, sharp, tart grapefruit leaps out at you in the nose, backed only by a whispy curtain of pine and a delicate waft of lightly caramelish maltiness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and creamy-smooth with a very-fine bubbled, moderate natural-carbonation from bottle-conditioning. The flavor offers more grapefruit, and a touch of pine, but it's at least somewhat reigned in by balancing malt. It's sweetish, but just enough to balance it and keep the resinousy hops afloat; and it's caramelish, falling somewhere between medium and medium-dark. A bold bitterness anchors it from a malty-sweet side, but the hop flavors are let loose to run free. Intense! It's initially like squeezing a fistfull of wet hops, but that gives way to more maltiness as you get further into it. It seems to have a bit of strength to it, but the alcohol never really shows. I'd like it to be more rounded, but I'm not sure how that could be possible without losing a bit of what it already has going for it. And I wonder how drinkable it could be on a pint to pint basis? For the hop heads of the world, here's to you!!!","NeroFiddled","Aug 20, 2006"

"4.3","+8.9%","4","4","4.5","4","4.5","Drinkability: A solid beer--one that speaks to Dean at Ale Asylum's desire to offer a variety of full-bodied beers with exceptional flavor.

Definitely worth checking out.","expatsteve","Aug 19, 2006"

"4.4","+11.4%","4","4","4.5","5","4.5","Im leery of lumping hop bomb reds like this and Troegs Nugget Nectar in with the likes of Capital Amber or Leinies Red. It almost seems like cheating. Comparatively, all regular reds and ambers should get straight ones or twos when held up to imperials like this and so I find my self reviewing three styles of beer, (Amber, Red, and Imp. Red), within one category on BA. Despite my hesitancy to rate the imperials considerably higher than perfectly drinkable but much less hopped reds and ambers, I have to admit that this is one kick-but beer. Appearance is a dark amber-red with orange hues and a thin creamy off white head. Aromas of pine resin and grapefruit are strong. Malts are present but the decent toffee/caramel backbone is largely overshadowed by huge citrus hops. This beer is juicy, pulpy, 100% grapefruit. Its damn delicious, very bitter, but with a creamy finish reminiscent of Dreadnaught. I will even go as far as to say that this is the best of Ale Asylums initial 10 offerings.","DaPeculierDane","0"
