Then you read the reviews and actually find that if you pay enough attention, that beer might be better than you've expected. Well, this is definitely one of those. Not sure what the average Rogue drinkers like as they have quite a few brews that I personally would never dare call beers but this Captain Sig's is most certainly one. A really good beer actually. It might be more appealing to the IPA crowd (like me, I'm a total hop head…) at 80 IBU's but its got some interesting caramel malt flavours too. It's cloudy, dark amber, almost born in colour with a good head that vanishes somewhat fast. The smell and taste are both slightly boozy but not harsh or anything, just enough to let you know that you are not dealing with a typical mass production brew. It has a medium body with good carbonation. This beer is good! Nowhere near my all-time favourite but one I would definitely recommend and buy again.","Niceroad77","Jun 09, 2014"

In fairness, I have yet to have a bad Rogue beer ... I will say that I am selective in what I try (e.g., no beers containing "donut flavoring", whatever that is) and will snag certain Rogue beers when I find them on tap, as was the case here. This one is a brownish-copper color, rather like weak coffee or strong tea, with a nice light tan head of approximately four inches height. Nose was fruity, sweet, rich, and mildly astringent, with orange and tangerine citrus hops leading the way, followed up by light roast coffee and cacao powder. Almost smells like a highly-hopped porter! In the mouth, this one delivers a rich toffee malt backbone with some plum and dark toast notes ... Massive crystal malts that hit that sweet spot. Darker and richer than many amber ales, and with a pretty robust hop attack as well. Tangy and spicy, with the aforementioned citrus from the nose on the palate as well, along with some vanilla, rum extract, blackberry, gooseberry, and bitter earthy orange pekoe tea. Quite chewy but prickly on the tongue, with a little ashy resin and pine in the dry, roasted, bitter finish. Wow. I am surprised that all these seemingly disparate elements hang together so well without unpleasant clashes. Insanely tasty and proof that when Rogue gives up the gimmicks and other harebrained ideas, they can concoct some delicious offerings.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 23, 2014"

Good lacing as you drink. Aromas of rich, roasted caramel and a heavy handed dose of wet, resiny hops. Flavors of tangy caramel in the backbone, with a dose of tropical fruit sweetness to keep it light and layered. The tail end of the palate is peppery hopped, with a spicing and bitterness that cleans the palate quickly and sharply. Tangy sweet and slightly bitter aftertaste, with a clean, crisp finish. Very solid, hoppy red brew; good one to keep handy in the fridge.","GarthDanielson","Dec 31, 2012"

Initially this has the makings of a good amber ale. Pretty malty sweet at first and smooth. But it finishes with that classic Rogue taste that ruins all their beer. Much like Captain Sig's Northwestern battling with the ocean, this beer seems to battle with the house flavors. The malt notes are good, strong, but are no match for the regional earthy hop attack Rogue's beers are so known for. Some nuttier flavors are able to cut through the hops, but the hops consume them like a rogue wave (all puns intended). If Rogue really wanted to make a beer to commemorate the Deadliest Catch (and incidentally their beers in general), they should have call this beer Rogue Wave.","100floods","Sep 08, 2011"

Nose is caramel malts and faint hops, bready/yeast, slight bitterness but overall smooth malt forward. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, feels a bit light perhaps but pleasant nonetheless. Overall a well enjoyed beer and certainly justified of its price. Not getting much to style in the American Amber field, tastes more like a strong ale but lacks the abv punch. Probably the last of the Rogue beers from the brewery feature i'll get to try and so overall I'd give the feature a 3.8/5.

Big tropical mango aroma accented with floral and evergreen needle notes. Juicy tangerine and mango in the mouth, transitioning into pine and and grapefruit bitterness. There is a bit of a malt backbone that provides a little bit of sweetness to the beer, but it is by no means enough to balance the firm bitterness provided by the hops. And that doesn't bother me one bit. Bitterness lingers long into the aftertaste. Medium-bodied with soft, light carbonation. Feels soft and velvety in the mouth. Slick oily sensation on the roof of the mouth between sips. Salivation between sips as well - anticipation for the next mouthful. Lovely beer.

"3.58","-4.8%","3.5","3","4","3.5","3.5","Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. It is a little hoppy for my taste, but I am a malt-head. That said, they have enough malt to balance the beer a bit...though the hops prevail at every checkpoint along the way. I honestly think that this is a pretty good example of a Red Ale, but unfortunately I don't have that many to compare it to. The few Irish examples have the same sort of "sharpness" to the grain bill that is hard to place that this beer has, so I really think that the grain bill is good for the style. The hops, however, seem way over the top for what you would expect and push this beer up into the IPA category or beyond. This seems to confuse things, at least on my palate, for where this beer sits. Perhaps it is just the water at Rogue that seems to consistently "ruffle my feathers", but there is something that reacts with the hops in their lighter colored beers that rubs me the wrong way. This beer does it too.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 15, 2011"

The mouthfeel is really quite smooth and finishes a bit dry with hops lingering on the palate. Overall a delicious hoppy northwest US amber ale.","uwmgdman","Mar 15, 2011"

Color was a hazy deep reddish-amber. Mouthfeel was medium with an initial hop bite on the tongue, accompanied by a mild cocoa flavor. Sticky lacing began to appear pretty quickly. Finish was likewise initially heavy on the hops but then giving 'way to a mild cocoa flavor on the extreme finish. I am mildly saddened to find that this is a limited release since my first bottle was consumed in a darkened movie theater while I watched "Black Swan". I decided to buy another bottle and see how it a) looked in the light and b) tasted out of a glass. Pretty darn good, actually.

It's a well blended and well balanced flavor. It almost seems a touch sweet at first, with the carmelly malt tones and the candy-like hop oils. The bitterness becomes more agressive and green.

Lacing on the glass is a non-uniformed web. Color is as expected, amber with a good tint of coppery red, gets more opaque as you reach the bottom of the glass. Certainly freshly cut open grapefruit smell, with lemon and sweet pineapple upside cake in the background. Taste picks up where the smell left off, pineapple upside down cake is more pronounced as the caramel malt notes add to the sweetness. The American side of this style hits at the end with hefty dry, bitterness from the hops, never overpowering though. The mouthfeel could easily fit into a varying range of beer styles, medium bodied, well carbonated, and smooth. Picked this beer up to make a dressing for some salmon fish tacos, should work out well. Very much a west coast version of a beer that is halfway between a Hopback Amber and a Nugget Nectar.","wchesak","Feb 10, 2010"

A ring is left around the sides of the beer and a small cloud on top. Light lacing is left as I gulp this one down. Smells hoppy up front, piney and citrus. These hops are laid on top of a sweet malt background. Pretty typical hoppy amber smell but still pretty good. I get some hints of fruits in here also. Taste is solid. Piney, earthy and citrus hops are laid out on top of a nice malt backbone. The malts are mostly sweet. There is a nice amount of bitterness from the hops in the taste. The mouthfeel here is good. There is a light-medium body with pretty low carbonation, that I enjoy. There is some creaminess to the body which helps the low carbonation and makes it work. No warmth in the beer and a coat of bitter hops is left on the tongue, smooth. This is definitely a solid amber ale. Aside from the appearance there is nothing wrong with this ale. It basically makes me think of a good West coast hop profile with some malts to balance. No off flavors or alcohol and a decent price, I enjoyed it for sure.","cbutova","Jan 15, 2010"

A bit of a malty scent, but no overwhelming red/amber ale aromas (deep malt, chocolate malt, etc) because of the overriding hop aroma. Too hoppy for its taste, too, overwhelming any nice amber ale flavors that should be present; had the signature Rogue flavor, which isn't bad, but makes it very non-unique. Goes down a bit rough from the over-hopping. If you're going to make a pale ale, just make a pale ale, not a pale ale with a bit of amber malt ingrediants.","JamesS","Dec 14, 2009"

Nothing from the malt is detected. The flavor is a little more balanced. Big hoppy citrus and resiny flavor up front and then sweetness from the malt lasts till the finish.

The malts and hops combine to almost give a light cinnamon and pumkin sweet aroma, before tha hop citrus smashes that to bits. The starts dry malty toast. The middle quickly relinquishes to the hops. The finish has no sign of malt at all, only total, bitting into a whole orange taste and sensation. What a bitter palate on this brew. Once this beer warms a little, the bitterness is identical to that of taking your first bite into orange peel.

Lots of hop flavor to accompany the bitterness, with grapefruit and pine lasting long into the finish.

When it does, a this webb of lace is left behind. Piny, resiny hops float through a mass of sweet malts to the nose. Aroma is thick and earthy to an extent. Taste is a bit more subdued than the aroma would lead you to believe. The hops are initially subverted by thick caramel malts, and there is not much balance to speak of. The hops become more apparent after a few drinks in, but something is still a bit off. Some subtle light fruits exist way underneath it all. Mouth-feel is thick and a bit above medium bodied.

Solid body with fizzy carbonation, quite astringent with a chalky bitterness. The hop profile really doesn't do it for me. It is chalky bitter and very dry.

Just the slightest of caramel and dried plums flash in for a second when its warmer, but that gets drowned out by a dry citrusy bitter finish.

Dissipating cap begins to look like krausen. Nose is mild mix of flowery hops and sweet malt. Brings to mind brown sugar, whole grain bread, tangerine and dough. The foundational flavor of this red ale is a solid malt that's toasty and sweet. Riding over the top are bitter hop flavors like orange juice, sticky pine sap, and some green apple. These flavor levels get along for the most part and make for an interesting brew, but I'd like to see slightly more flavor cohesion and interaction. (As it warms, flavors begin to combine.) Mouthfeel is midweight and fine for the style. Despite a lasting malty finish, this brew is quite bitter. Overall, the interesting flavor profile and lack of funky flavors make this a solid beer, however, it's not quite up to the delicious standard that other Rogue ales have achieved.","ajuarez","0"

The hops are pretty much out of control, blurring any subtleties that maybe about. Prickly carbonation and a medium body deliver the expected mouthfeel here.

Love Sig and the show, and Rogue brewing, but Deadliest Ale was only a tad above average and therefore only moderately enjoyable.","olmatty","Jan 12, 2009"
"3.71","-1.3%","4","3","4","3.5","4","A very good and complex taste of bitter citrus a grass hop with a dark and sweet malt to blend. Since it's a red ale, I expect the hop bitterness to overpower the malt presence a bit as it does. Light alcohol presence as well as an earthy barley bite. Leaves the mouth a tad dry as it should as well.. nice bitter afterbite. I would guess it's about 6.6% alc. Very crisp and hoppy... well worth the try.","Docer","Jan 07, 2009"

"3.91","+4%","4.5","3.5","4","4","4","Bought the 22 ounce recently. Great appearance: murky, weak amber appearance with some really excellent lacing. Aromas had a fruity, sour citrus flavor to it mixed with malts and hops. Slightly earthy, but just a hint. Bitter taste with great mixtures of hops, yeast and grassy, earthy flavors. Good mouthfeel, stays carbonated with a good kick throughout drinking. Overall, great.","fitzy84","Dec 28, 2008"
