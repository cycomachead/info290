It's your basic amber, which at this point almost seems a little boring compared to some of the experiments that are out there, but sometimes you just want a good solid beer, and this fits the bill.  Nicely balanced, not heavy at all, very drinkable.","dcscientist","Want",

I didn't see much head at all and not much lacing, just a little.  The head in my glass was about an inch, off white and didn't persist long with decent lacing. Again very clear in a way that was immediately pleasing to the eye.","ravisingh","Feb 27, 2015",
