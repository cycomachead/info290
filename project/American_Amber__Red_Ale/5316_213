It's your basic amber, which at this point almost seems a little boring compared to some of the experiments that are out there, but sometimes you just want a good solid beer, and this fits the bill.  Nicely balanced, not heavy at all, very drinkable.","dcscientist","Friday at 12:42 PM"

"4","+7%","","","","","","Poured a clear amber body with a two finger white head that slowly receded leaving abundant lacing down the glass. Quite the nice looking amber ale. Scents of rich, malty, fruity esters, low levels of nuttiness and caramel aromas and an earthy hoppy and yeasty presence. Overall impression of aroma is of a very rich and malty bouquet with enough of a hop presence to provide a hint of balance. Quite nice. Flavor begins malty sweet, with heavy notes of caramel, sweet, bready malt and very light bitterness. This moves into a little bit more bitter middle with nutty malt, sweet caramel, light fruity esters and light toasted malt. The finish is malty sweet, with moderate toasted, nutty malt, light caramel, bready and biscuit-like malt with a medium-light bitterness. Aftertaste is nutty and toasted malt with a light breadiness and bitterness. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a pretty good amber ale that is quite rich and malty, but balanced. Rather well done. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with heavy carbonation and a smooth, rich feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice session ale that is quite nice. Overall this is a pleasant little malty amber ale. It smells and tastes quite rich and pleasant and feels smooth and sessionable. A nice, though not amazing, ale.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2014"

The hops are noticeable but not overwhelming, perhaps less so than Boston Lager. It has a nice dark amber color (imagine that). The smell is what bothers me. To me the smell isn't very attractive for a beer but besides that its a fine beer.","Jstewart6","Jan 28, 2014"

Compared to Fat Tire (the motivation for this review), this has a bit more complexity that I feel comes from more substantial hopping. I wouldn't say this is a "better" beer than Fat Tire by any means, both have their place. However, it certainly lets the hops come out and play more assertively yet still maintains good balance.","Redneckwine","Dec 04, 2013"

On the palate it’s heavenly smooth and deliciously malt forward without heaviness. Toasted grain sweetness, mellow rich malt and a playful touch of hops bitter and oily pine to keep it interesting. Sweet meets bitter in perfect harmony. As it warms the hops add a little spice to the aftertaste and with a bitter swish it finishes long yet gentle. This is a smart and well turned out amber.

They certainly know how to clarify their beers in Hood River. Nose was nutty, not nutty like me, but more like pecans, walnuts, almonds, that sort of thing. Say, don't I remember something untoward about a bitter almond smell in liquids? Nah, I must be mistaken. Mouthfeel was medium and it really had a nutty flavor to it on the tongue. Finish had a minty hoppiness to go along with the nuttiness noted previously. I am not a huge fan of ambers, unless they are the hot redhead giving me a lap dance, but this was eminently drinkable. Now, if they would just CAN their beers, I would be a total fan ...","woodychandler","Mar 23, 2013"

Nose is a bit disapointing after the great eye show. Pale malt and a touch of caramel dominate, with a bit of citrus and earthy hop and some fruity esters. With such low hop character, I'm questioning the age of my sample right now. Taste follows with a nicely balanced malty profile backed by hop and fruity esters. Bigger caramel here with a decent bittering and touch of citrus. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, easy drinker.

The mouthfeel is really water with a tiny bit of carbonation.

"3.24","-13.4%","3","4","3","3","3","The moderate head crests a little below a finger’s worth of eggshell white foam, dissipates in a big rush down to a thin layer across the surface, what meager lacing there is sticks adequately. The liquid is more brown than copper, likewise more red than orange, very clear and transparent, extremely few bubbles visible. The nose conveys sweetness via caramel, milk chocolate, pecans and yeast, comes up with a little citrus and herbal hops but remains tame overall, when the floral notes appear they support the sweeter profile, difficult to name any particular fruit aspect. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is on the low side causing it to feel semi-flat on the palate. Drier here with grass, pine, white pepper and sea salt nuances, at the same time there’s nuts, graham cracker, caramel and chocolate to bring it back to the middle. Which is where it resides, pleasurable but playing it safe. Fruitier through the finish with apple, peach and apricot notes. Hard to really fault it but, at the same time, doesn’t get you too excited to pop open another.","farrago","Mar 02, 2012"

If you're expecting something spectacular you will be disappointed, but if you're expecting a proper amber you will get just that.

"3.58","-4.3%","4","3.5","3.5","4","3.5","Full Sail Amber comes out amber like with a golden brown look and just enough bubbles to sustain a cap for a few minutes, a dark tan color on those bubbles, no stick though. Smell is str8 forward caramel and some small chocolate. Crystal malt is noted while a small hopping comes through, that's all I look for really in a amber, can't stand str8 caramel, personally. Taste is basically the same, Im impressed this is not so sweet and the hops hold their own in this fairly fresh bottle. Feel is less than medium but coating with some light carb running through it's vains, by no means bitey in any way. I drank it I enjoyed it, lets leave it at that.","BARFLYB","Jan 17, 2011"

I almost want to say there's some burnt malt flavors running around, too. There's some hop presence in there, but they aren't doing much of the talking. About half way through my 12oz pour I start to notice some sugary textures lingering in my mouth, but not over powering. Perfectly crisp, always refreshing. Take that Boont!

The flavor has just the right balance. Not overly complex. Flavor lingers for a while... all I can really say is that it has a great balance of hops and malt that creates a good tingly mouthfeel that smooths out to silk. The hops are present but more prominent in the smell, plus the chocolate malt effects the smell more than the taste as well, but they provide a toffee smoothness. Very drinkable. The flavor isn't too strong in any direction, but I like that about this beer. I've had the IPA and the pale.

Mouthfeel is light, thin and a bit on the watery side. With that being said, the drinkability isn't bad at all. It is smooth and goes down easy. Overall it's OK, but it's not something I'd make a point to seek out.","bluejacket74","Oct 07, 2007"

"3.93","+5.1%","4","3.5","4","4.5","4","Pours amber with a wood-like color mahogany? (I guess). Forms into a small 1 finger head and diminishes to 1-2mm within 60 seconds. Exceptionally nice --well organized lace is left on glass-especially for a bottled beer. Taste is the way an amber should be nicely balanced -- floral/hoppy - with slight malt. Maybe a touch of licorice or chocolate too. Finishes dry and clean, and a little fruity. Mouthfeel is very smooth, also surprisingly so for a bottled beer. Drinkabilty is dangerous --easy to get used to and this is not my favorite style. This is probably one of the better ambers I have tried.","rousee","Aug 30, 2004"

It has a slightly dry, yet sweet malt scent with a bit of hops in the background to round out the aroma. The taste is decent. It has a watery crystal/pale malt flavor with some hops and a bitter, grainy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This would be a much better beer if it had a bit more body and carbonation. It drinks decent despite it's flaws.","WesWes","Aug 15, 2004"

Aroma is soft and biscuity with a subdued dulled fruity sense, some lighter caramel and roasted malt within and a bit of grassy spiced hop underneath. Taste is a bit roasty but mostly dulled and sweet with a bit of a biscuit malt tone, milder hops with fresh cut grassy notes. Dull, chewy, nutty finish. A bit heavy on the malt end but sufficient hop spice and bittering help keep a yielding taste. The feel however does come across mostly malty, with a smooth medium body and a bit of chewy finish, getting close to cloying in some areas, but this does favor a good drinkability. Full Sail has themselves a pretty good amber here.","tavernjef","Mar 30, 2004"

I can compare it to beers I enjoy drinking, where it does not stand a chance, or compare it to widely available plain crap, in which case, it is on the upper echelon of not much. The nose is composed entirely of sweet malt, much like the flavor, which consists also of different faint hints thats are undistinguishable. It does at least produce a malty character, but the malt is not intriguing and it certainly leaves you will unfulfilled desire. Not a high recommendation from me certainly. On the other hand, as this is probably thir most available brew, the fact that they could adequately compose at least one flavor bodes fairly well for the brewery.","gnaussea","Oct 22, 2003"
"3.53","-5.6%","4","3.5","3.5","3.5","3.5","Pours a warm reddish amber with perfect clarity. Its light tan head starts out well enough, then fades to a small ring around the edge. Fair amount of lacing. Nice aroma with the balanced slightly tilted towards the sweet, fruity malt. A bit of green hops (dry-hopped?) as well as a hint of earthiness and minerals. Some caramel/crystal malt presence. The flavor is well balanced between the sweet, caramelly malt, the spicy and green hops, and earthy yeast. Theres a significant amount of mineral taste and hardness from an over-eager water treatment. Interestingly enough, the fruity esters and earthy yeast combine to take on an almost spice-like character. The body is on the lighter side of medium, with the aforementioned mineral dryness and chalkiness. Lots of carbonation. This is surprisingly good, and a very solid example of an undefined style.","MJR","Sep 25, 2003"

Anyway, this beer pours with a deep garnet color, and is quite clear when held up to the light. It has a light tan head that is reasonably persistent. The first aroma is one of hops; citrusy, and floral components. Then as you stick your nose in a bit deeper one gets a malty aroma and I seem to even detect a hint of roastiness, and some toasted maltiness as well. This is a quite malty brew with some definite hop notes to it as well. It has a sort of austere wine like finish to it, which is quite interesting. There is a good amount of body here, as the beer coats my taste buds and the back of my throat nicely. At the very end one gets a nice laying on of bitterness from the hops. It is not as hoppy (both aroma and flavor) as I remember it, but I suspect my tastebuds have changed quite a bit over the years.","Gueuzedude","Sep 20, 2003"

The aroma is sweet and wonderfully malty. This is mirrored in the taste which is also sweet and strongly malty. A hint of hops is also present.

It starts out dryish and malty and resolves to a balance of maltiness balanced by hop flavor and bitterness. Leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Yes, aftertaste can be a good thing to a Beer Advocate.
