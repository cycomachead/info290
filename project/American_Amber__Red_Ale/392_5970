The taste has tons of malt packed in but also some metalic aftertaste. It has some sweet tones from the amount of malt they use, but not much diversity in the flavor.  Medium-light mouthfeel, it is smooth, but one dimensional beer. Overall a good malty beer, but do have just one main aspect the beer has to be done well, this one was just ok from my experience.","wingman14","Link",
