The aroma gives off a really light sweet malt smell slightly overpowered by a medium citrus, piney, and slight earthy aroma. the taste is super well balanced between malt and slight citrus hope flavor with a light medium body and lasting dry finish.

The smell is mild, bready, lite hops, overall nothing earthshaking.  The taste is of bread, herbal hops and malt.  It reminds me of a well hopped Wee Heavy.  Prretty good, I'd have another.","SFNC","Mar 12, 2015",
