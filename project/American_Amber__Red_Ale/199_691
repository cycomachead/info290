"3.76","-0.8%","4.25","3.25","4","3.75","3.75","Pours a clear deep amber/pale brown with a reddish hue producing 2 fingers of somewhat lasting, pale tan, foamy/frothy head that leaves a clumpy coating of streaky, webby lacing. Aroma is disappointing & promises little: thin toffee, caramel & earthy herbal hops. Taste is another kettle of fish altogether (no pun intended). The mouth is an intense version of the nose on steroids with dark bread, roast and nutty notes, more intense earthy hops & yeasty/malty fruity esters. The sip finishes with caramel, roast & nuts, fruit, some pepper & an increasing hop bitterness. Afrertaste is a dry, astringent & bitter bomb that is out of character for the style but most welcome to card carrying Hop-Heads such as myself. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, dry, creamy, silky with slight spice & a pleasant astringency. I don\'t remember an amber ale with this much bitterness.","mothmanscott","Thursday at 06:40 PM",

I've been on a big Ballast Point kick lately and was hoping that this would measure up to the Sculpin beers that I've enjoyed. While a bit too earthy and malty for me, this was a solid take on the style that went down easily and at the same time wasn't too terribly strong.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 29, 2015",

Mouthfeel seems typical for the style. Moderate carbonation. Overall a good example of the style. One that I don't frequently drink but should explore a bit more.","Kolbfusion","Mar 25, 2015",
