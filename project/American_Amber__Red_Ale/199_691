"3.56","-6.1%","4.5","4","3.25","3.25","3.5","Overall - A decent amber here, but some things about it rub me the wrong way. The carbonation seems a bit too high and effervescent and the high bitterness level doesn't really seem to jive all that well with the overall taste. Not bad, but not great either. Not strong enough to be a repeat purchase for me.","Redneckwine","Thursday at 06:40 PM"

"3.76","-0.8%","4.25","3.25","4","3.75","3.75","Pours a clear deep amber/pale brown with a reddish hue producing 2 fingers of somewhat lasting, pale tan, foamy/frothy head that leaves a clumpy coating of streaky, webby lacing. Aroma is disappointing & promises little: thin toffee, caramel & earthy herbal hops. Taste is another kettle of fish altogether (no pun intended). The mouth is an intense version of the nose on steroids with dark bread, roast and nutty notes, more intense earthy hops & yeasty/malty fruity esters. The sip finishes with caramel, roast & nuts, fruit, some pepper & an increasing hop bitterness. Afrertaste is a dry, astringent & bitter bomb that is out of character for the style but most welcome to card carrying Hop-Heads such as myself. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, dry, creamy, silky with slight spice & a pleasant astringency. I don\'t remember an amber ale with this much bitterness.","mothmanscott","Mar 29, 2015"

This would be great to take along for a day of fishing as there's enough here to please any beer lover while not being too heavy-handed. Once again, Ballast Point has brewed a beer that's spot-on when it comes to a particular style while keeping a good toasted undertone and pretty crisp finish that wanted me coming back for more. Relaxingly nice stuff!","JerzDevl2000","Mar 25, 2015"
