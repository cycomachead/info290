"3.82","-6.6%","3","3.5","4","4","4","On tap at Beachwood BBQ and poured into half size ale glass. Appearance is copper-orange with foamy head that settles, but leaves the glass coated with lace. Big balanced aromas split between herbal and citrus hops and toffee malts, plus a little dankness. Taste is early butterscotch and brown sugar sweetness mixed with orange peel bitterness and alcohol esters warm on the swallow. Medium-full bodied with a creamy and thick mouthfeel, the carbonation is low and soft.","SierraFlight","Feb 02, 2015"

Smelled very nice with a good combination of sweet and hoppy with a bit of the alcohol coming through.  Taste was very similar.  Quite delicious but with the alcohol breaking through.  Great beer for sitting down in front of the fire on a cold winter night.","KidDoc","Jan 26, 2015"
