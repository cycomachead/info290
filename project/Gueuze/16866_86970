I have had other sours with this baking soda like flavor, which I'm not a fan of, but the other flavors of this beer are actually pretty good. I pair this with chicken Picatta.

Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head.  Head retention is decent, and there's a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like apricots, funk, vinegar, green apples, hay and some lemon peel.  The taste is nice too, with apricot, funk, green apple, bready/grainy malt, hay, vinegar, lemon peel, and earthy flavors all noticeable.  It's nice and tart!  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and has a good amount of carbonation.  I liked this brew, certainly wouldn't mind buying more of this in the future.","bluejacket74","Nov 27, 2014"

4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/10/2013. Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart lemon peel, green apple, white wine, vinegar, wet hay, herbal, straw, grass, leather, musty funk, oak, pepper, cracker, light wheat, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tart lemon peel, green apple, white wine, vinegar, wet hay, herbal, straw, grass, musty funk, leather, oak, pepper, cracker, wheat, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/vinegar acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon peel, green apple, white wine, vinegar, wet hay, herbal, straw, grass, musty funk, leather, oak, pepper, wheat, cracker, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately acidic, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome gueuze style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 14, 2014"

Scents of sour barnyard funk, green apple, apple cider vinegar, sour cherry, sour citrus and citrus peel and light aromas of oak and faint vanilla. A with wonderfully layered aroma with a true to style bouquet that is appealing and wild. Flavor begins delightfully sour with notes of sour, wild Brett, lemon juice, sour raspberry and sour green apple. This moves into a sour middle of sour green apple and sour barnyard funk. Finish is dry and sour with a wonderful flavor of oak, sour green apple, sour raspberry, sour Brett funk, and lemon juice. Aftertaste is sour with notes of raspberry, sour green apple and oak. A wonderful flavor profile that is dry, sour, fruity and complex. A fine geuze. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and a puckering, drying feel. A good, refreshing mouthfeel. Overall this is a fine geuze. It is sour, fruity and complex in aroma and taste and combines with a refreshing mouthfeel to make a fine geuze lambic. Quite nice and highly recommended.","Auraan","Aug 03, 2014"

Taste is bright sour fruits (primarily lemon and apple), oak, grass and a bit of subdued funk. Quite tart and fairly acetic in a similar manner to Hannsenns oude gueuze. Finishes with a lemony zing which is very gueuze-like but there is a malty sweetness that is un-gueuze-like. Active, creamy effervescent carbonation lends a nice mouthfeel to this light-bodied beer. Overall this is a very nicely done american sour ale that has held up well with almost a year since bottling. Refreshing, tasty and very sour! Recommended.","brianmandell","Jul 15, 2014"

In the taste, sour traits and a great blend to add depth and complexity. Hard to discern between some of the better Gueze (or Gueuze) I've had. Well defined flavors of candi sugar, fresh lemon peel, oak, and healthy wild yeast tartness. Barrel aged brew with a soft dryness. Medium bodied, good sustain. Overall, this is as good as some imports, and the three batch blend gives it that authentic taste. Great beer!","Stinkypuss","Jun 12, 2014"

Loads of really satisfying Lambic flavor...sour lemon, stone fruit, light woody funk, mineral. Acidic, but not too sharp or lactic. Easily drinkable, dry, puckering, lip-smacking goodness. I expect good things from The Bruery, but this really surprised me. On a night full of funky goodness at Sourfest, this was my favorite of the night and the only beer I needed a refill. I haven't tried this from the bottle yet, but I'd be less hesitant to fork over $20 now. Excellent!","wedge","Jan 31, 2014"

Like Champagne to the wine world, beer cannot be called Gueuze outside certain areas of Belgium but The Bruery has, in Rueuze, created one of the closest American Wild Ale clones of this classic and highly sought after style. From it's bright golden color to the invitingly funky aroma, this sour power beer has all of it's bases covered with exceptional grace and the best part is, this is one Bruery beer that makes it out into distribution!

Color is a clear gold amber with lots of large bubble trails. Aroma at first is a very heady blend of many things including acidic fruit, fresh sawn lumber, olives, yeast, malt. Then a lot of that quiets down. Flavor’s much like nose, tart stands out but has just enough sweet to balance; almost no bitter, oak is in there. Body/carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, is unusually drinkable for a gueuze, strangely a tad boozy too.","drpimento","Jan 06, 2014"

The Bruery doesn't have make a spontaneously fermented sour ale, so instead their "Rueuze" is a blend of their 1-3 year old sour blonde ale. The added aging really allows some of apricot heavy, matured Brettanomyces character to really shine in lock step with the assertive, but not grating tartness.

I suspected it would not and I was right. Appearance is orange, clear (let it settle for two months and poured it like a gueuze), and looks almost identical to Cantillon gueuze. Aroma is interesting, has a mustiness and a slight touch of minerals and copper that immediately makes me think of Cuvee Rene. Slight touch of body odor (no lie, sweaty), cereal and then ass (eww). The aroma is good at first but its not gueuze. I can deal with sweat and body odor but not ass. Super fruity flavor, sour, tart, tastes good but this is definitely going to stand out in a blind tasting as not being authentic gueuze, it lacks funk in the flavor and has a sweetness to it. I caught a sweetness in Duck Duck Gooze as well and I've never caught that in the real stuff. Overall I would not buy this again, its not fooling anyone as a gueuze but as a wild ale it was a good offering. Probably one of the better beers I've had from The Bruery (I usually avoid them).","ArrogantB","Mar 23, 2013"

Aroma has a bit of citrus, in the form of lemon/lime but this is quickly squashed by the abundance of acetic acid and its dominance on the nose. Taste follows suit. It’s quite tart but not in a complex, funky, traditional gueuze style way, more in a "oops I just squirted vinegar in my mouth" kinda way. Mouthfeel has an unusual oily papery feel. That’s the best way I can describe it. Nothing about this is "gueuze-style" in any way other than it was a blend of 3 different barrels. This was a drain pour. One of very few in the past several years (the last one was also a Bruery beer). Overall, I was less than impressed with this beer or the price tag it demanded. This is yet another overrated, sad failure of a beer from Bruery. They, as of this writing, will no longer be getting any of my business.","julian","Jan 25, 2013"

Small white head...not necessarily head...more like A LOT of bubbles. Scent is musky and mineral-forward at first. A bit of vitamin mineral aromas with some nice funk and tropical fruit aromas. Sour stone fruits...apricots, peaches, and even some green apples come through in the nose. I also get some grape skin aromas. Smells like it's gonna be pretty sour. Taste is not as sour as I was expecting (this ain't no Mother Funker). I was hoping for something like Mother Funker, but with more carbonation. This one has the carbonation, just not as much as most traditional Gueuze have. Taste is quite acidic, with peaches and nectarine flavors. Slight tropical flavors with mango and pineapple. Funky, but not "traditional gueuze funky". Still very tasty. Mouthfeel is liking a bit. It could use a bit more carbonation... other than that, the tannic, sticky feel works well with this beer. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a decent attempt at an American Gueuze. However, it falls short of some of The Bruery's best sour beers.","DovaliHops","Jan 19, 2013"

The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, tart, sour, apricot, and brine. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I fully understand what the Bruery was going for with this one and I think they nailed it pretty well. This brew had all of the traditional characteristics of a Gueuze, but just not to the intense nature as some of them. The kiss of apricot was a nice welcomed addition to cut some of the acidic nature of the beer to make it more enjoyable. All in all a pretty well done brew that I wouldn’t mind having again the future or aging to see how it develops.","thagr81us","Jan 15, 2013"

The taste, if anything, is even more savory- there is a pleasant brininess here, some peach and apricot, and a lot of tartness. Once again, fruity, but not sweet.
