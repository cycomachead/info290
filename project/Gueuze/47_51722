There is also a moderate amount of tannins here, along a rather strong lactic note. There is also flavor reminiscent of acetic acid/acetone, but not quite. The upshot is that the sourness is harsh, and lacks the finesse of some of the better gueuzes out there. Not as musty as the nose would suggest, the funk is mostly a blend of hay, and some mushrooms. The wheaty, cereal sweetness does appear in the mid-palate, strongly reminding me of the Lindemans Cuvee Rene. The mouthfeel is a bit confusing - it's mildly slimy (like a baker's egg wash), but highly carbonated, sweet yet dry, and also a little alcoholic, and a little too tannic for my palate. The tannins enhance the sourness and the harsh qualities of this gueuze. The high ABV makes this a little hard to drink as well. Not bad, but not going out of your way to try IMO, and drinking an entire bottle only emphasizes its flaws.","DefenCorps","Dec 26, 2011"

Feel ties everything together nicely too. Would love a bottle of this to age for a couple years.","SpeedwayJim","Sep 19, 2011"
4.1,-3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"O - Definitely not as sour as the 2009, but has more balance and will be a better candidate for aging. It seems like Armand played a big part in this blend because it was very similar to the 2010' DF geuze we opened next to it.","xpimptastikx","Jul 16, 2011"

4.39,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Shared this one with the NC guys during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to cwguy5 for picking this one up for me while he was in Belgium! 2009 Vintage! Bottle #11382! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a golden yellow orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sour, funk, tart, wood, and slight must. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, sour, tart, fruit, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great beer. It was a really big hit at the tasting and was a few peoples surprise of the night considering the company of beers present this was saying something. Both the flavor and aroma were screaming with notes that were quite appealing and pleasing to every sense that could pick them. My only gripe would be that it wasn't the prettiest beer I've ever seen for the style, but what can you do??? A definite must try for anyone out there if you have not. So good I am going to be looking for a few more bottles of this along with the 2011 to put in my cellar for awhile.","thagr81us","Jun 16, 2011"

4.1,-3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750ml bottle thanks to grownfool. More orange than yellow with a good foamy head. Smell was slightly sour, dusty citrus, good. The taste was also very good but did not have a lot of horseblanket or barnyard, mostly sour citrus with a slight bit of phenol and rubber on the backend. This was so damn easy to drink, quite good. I had read that this gueuze was not so great but I disagree, this was a very good gueuze.","ArrogantB","Jun 06, 2011"
4.22,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - We crushed the 750ml bottle quite easily. It gets extremely dry and tannic, but otherwise it's quite easy drinking. I might need to get another one of these for the cellar, as I can see it holding up for the listed 20 years.","MasterSki","May 29, 2011"

2.83,-33.3,3.5,3,3,2,2.5,"Overall -- HORALs proves that Americans aren't the only ones who can make a lackluster collaboration beer. Nothing particularly spectacular about this gueuze, and the over-carbonation is horrendous. The top lambic makers of Belgium put their heads together and came up with this?","yeahnatenelson","Apr 10, 2011"
4.37,3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a moderate golden-yellow color with some visible carbonation. Pretty good white head with a touch of lacing. The nose is mega funky with a really nice barnyard presence and a bit of hay. Really strong in everything. Mild diaper and rubber in the background, in a good way. The flavor continues along the same route with quite a bit of complex funk. Light to medium body with a very dry finish. Quite a good brew. Thanks again, Matt.","Thorpe429","Jan 31, 2011"

4.45,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"It lives up to the aroma. Beer is bright and light on the palate. The sourness hits you almost immediately and carries through to the tart finish of the beer, oh so wonderful. The finish isn't too dry but it is dry.

4.31,1.7,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Big thanks to Dave for sharing. Much more cohesive with more depth, it tasted like Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze. Bright citrus up front, sour but well balanced, pleasant dry woodiness on the back end. Great stuff.","emerge077","Sep 26, 2010"
4.02,-5.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Light straw colored clear body, good carbonation, small amount of quickly dissipating head, not much lacing. Nose is pretty funky with a bit of stone fruit, a bit acidic, complex, and nicely balanced, no noticeable hops.. The taste is insanely complex due to the 'mega' blending, I had a hard time picking the different components, but overall some leather, a bit of horseblanket, face puckering sourness, a bit of tartness, good dose of salty goodness, and a lot of wooden character from the aging vessel, no hops to speak of. Fairly full mouthfeel for style, real good effervescence. Real tasty, though I wonder if this 'mad experiment' would taste completely different the next time.","jdense","Sep 09, 2010"

4.02,-5.2,4,4.5,4,3,4,"Flavor is bretty up front and has an oaky vanilla sweetness building up to a lactic sour aftertaste. Not completely dry, I can see the brett developing this beer into something really great in a couple of years. The taste is not as complex as the aroma yet but the carbonation is lively on your tongue. Carbonation might be getting in the way of this one.","BearsOnAcid","Jul 18, 2010"

4.89,15.3,4,5,5,4.5,5,"An extraordinary bottle shared by emaineiacman at SMBDC meet-up in May, brought back from Belgium. One of the most exquisite & unusual blends of 8 of Belgium's best lambic brewers. Dry, woody, great aroma of mustiness, deep orangey color, long-lasting tart finish, respectable head. Has been on my life-list for awhile, and can say it is very much worth the effort to procure if gueuze is your passion.","duchessedubourg","May 20, 2010"
1.9,-55.2,2,2,2,1,2,"Stone makes frequent references to fizzy yellow beer, and this one fits the bill. And at 12.50, it doesn't even have the benefit of being cheap.","alfrantzell","Apr 17, 2010"
4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy golden color gueuze with a huge foamy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of light acidity with some oak and lots of tart notes. Taste is not as complex as I would have hoped but some very nice notes of oak with some well balance acidity and sourness makes this a very refreshing drink. I thought it lack some of the green apple notes and barnyard aroma of gueuze. I will not necessarily seek this one out again but very enjoyable nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","Mar 29, 2010"

4.44,4.7,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Really stinky sour cheese scent. Incredibly funky, with some unbelievable tart lemon. There is an incredible cherry scent that I have been picking up a lot lately in some of the better wild yeast fermented beers I have had. I couldn't keep my nose out of the glass. The taste mirrors the scent perfectly and is incredibly tart. This really blended together well. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated but a little bit too sharp which works against the mouthfeel slightly. All in all, an excellent offering.","CoolJosh","Aug 11, 2009"
4.5,6.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I am so glad that my bottle has been cleaned of all the diacetyl that has been troubling some peoples bottles. Pediococcus is a prodigious diacetyl producer and Lambics definitely need time to reduce it back out. I am so glad that this turned out to be quite tasty. Man this is quite good, about as tart / sour as I could want with just enough funkiness to keep things interesting. This is a fantastic example of a Gueuze, at least this particular bottle is; if you are too worried just hold on to these for a 6 months or so (perhaps the international shipping helped my bottles).","Gueuzedude","Aug 08, 2009"
