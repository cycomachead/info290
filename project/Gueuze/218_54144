I appreciate any efforts at reviving and popularizing Lambic, but products this bad are not doing the style (nor its potential consumers) any favours. This brewery makes a reasonably good mainstream Belgian ale and they should stick to that. Brew Lambics traditionally or leave the tradition to the real lambic brewers.","biegaman","Jun 13, 2013"

3.36,-4,3,3.25,3.5,3,3.5,"Beer is medium-light in body, with medium-high to high carbonation levels, resulting in a strong fizziness that quickly foams the beer on the palate: you first feel tingling, then more soothing foam. Closes semi-dryly, with moderate residual stickiness on the palate.","falloutsnow","Feb 13, 2012"

3,-14.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Pour is a transparent rusty orange with an off white tight bubbly head. Fairly rindy funk, light yeast and spice, some sweet golden fruits, caramel, metallic acetic note. The funk is there in the taste, a bit dusty and some leathery rind, light phenol, yeasty spice, sweet caramel and golden fruits flitter in with acetic notes in back. The body is light with a soft palate and moderate carbonation.","cpetrone84","May 08, 2011"

3.46,-1.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O: pretty much your standard Belgian sour. Though a little boring, it's drinkable and hits the spot when your craving the style.","nickhiller","Feb 24, 2010"
3.26,-6.9,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Strong brett and lemons in the aroma. Must, vanilla sweetness, sweat, and hay. Taste is more brett forward and has a light bile flavored acidity. Dry bitter brett finish. The beer leaves a ghostly fresh green apple flavor on the tongue which is interesting.","BearsOnAcid","Nov 15, 2009"
4.45,27.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is very good, this was a great gueuze, enjoyable without blistering funk, very refined and well made. Obviously my experience is the polar opposite of the previous reviewers, not sure why that would be unless they significantly retooled the blend (or as he mentioned, perhaps different blenders make different batches for De Koninck). I probably got this from Bier Temple in Brussels.","ccrida","Beers"
2.24,-36,4,2.5,2,2,2,"Note on Brewery: I placed this beer with De Koninck since that is what the information on the bottle indicated to me, however, Tim Webb's book indicates that this is brewed by Boon and other websites have it listed with Mort Subite's brewer...","DaPeculierDane","0"
