Mouth but a bit too watery despite a strange smell of bananas (a bit like the fruit sauces because they are feeling a little fiber and it is still quite soft in the mouth). The finish is subtly but quite low acid flavors. Little sugar, which is already better than nothing, but the body is too low compared to other lambic.","ThaCreep","0"

Nice retention and lacing covers about 1/4 of the glass. Smells of apples, lemon, quite tart. Flavour is both sour and sweet. Nice carbonation level. This reminds me of the Sour Patch Kids candy that I used to eat while I was younger. It tastes nice, but not something that I would drink everyday.","kwjd","Aug 24, 2010"

Lacing was substantial too. The aroma off the beer was tart, though dominated by apple aromas. Sadly the taste was just apples with not nearly enough tartness at first, although over time it was getting sour. A nice bite with moderate carbonation, but not a beer I would seek out to drink ever again.","kjyost","Jul 25, 2010"

3.18,-2.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Tha beer was light gold colored with a thin white foam that dissipated quickly to a film. The aroma was slightly tart, more like an apple than like vinegar. The sweetness in the taste was also more indicative of apples than anything else. Very pleasant and easy to drink, with a minimum of funky sour bite. A great gateway to the style, not gonna be everyone's favorite but I liked it. Maybe it was the atmosphere...","TurdFurgison","Apr 10, 2010"
2.35,-27.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Gueuze is a bit of an acquired taste; bad gueuze, such as this, goes far beyond that.

3.11,-4.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"375ml bottle. Part of the LCBO's Spring 2010 Beer Release. Cider golden yellow with amber hues, a ring of white head, and dots of lacing on the stange. Sour candy, horse blanket, and barnyard aromas suggest the use of Brett. I also get some flower pedals. Taste is sweet, fruity malts, citrus, and a lemony, sour tartness that quickly fades away. More funk (woody, herbal) and hints of vinegar in the aftertaste. Not as sugary as I thought it would be, which is a good thing. Light-bodied mouthfeel is spritzy, spiced, and astringent. Decent enough, but I don't actually enjoy it. Meh.","cratez","Mar 02, 2010"
3.33,2.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This being my first Gueuze, I didn't know what to expect, but this left me satisfied. If the sweetness of this derived from real fruits rather than artifical sweeteners, I think it would be a completely different beer. At a slightly higher price tag for a somewhat average beer, I won't be buying this too often, but this one does leave me looking forward to my next gueuze.","ludachris","Mar 02, 2010"

3.13,-4,3.5,3,3,2,4,"Picked up a small bottle at a Brussels beer shop to drink in the hotel. Pours into a small wine glass a ripe gold color with a shin off white head that quickly dissolves to thin lace. Aroma contains tart, almost candy like apple notes, hints of vinegar, and a generic Belgian pale fruity yeastiness. The taste is mildly tart and sour on the front of the palate but quickly turns sweet and almost sugary with apple flavors and pale malts making up the bulk of the flavor. Hops seem to be absent entirely. Body is crisp and smooth with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink but not my favorite of the style.","DaPeculierDane","Jun 17, 2009"
4.15,27.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a really nice sour Belgian beer that isn't as harsh as others of its kind and is worth drinking for a long time.","TheManiacalOne","May 28, 2009"

2.65,-18.7,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,1.5,"Taste: sickly sweet, oh my God. The aroma was a trick! It's like apple juice without the depth of flavour. The sour note is there, hanging in the background, and a bit of a brett aftertaste, but it's like the added a bunch of sugar to mask what could have been an alright sour beer. Mouthfeel is light and airy with a soft carbonation. It would be refreshing is the beer wasn't so dreadful in the flavour department. No way would I want another.","trevorwideman","Jun 01, 2008"
1.88,-42.3,3.5,3,1.5,1.5,1,"Pours a golden apple colour, one finger white head that quickly dissipates. Nose- sweet apple juice, very slight wood. Taste- very sweet, flat and ugly. Grainy, musky, thick syrupy mess. A beer you would give someone if you really didn't enjoy hanging out with said person. A total drain pour. The only "gueze" available in Manitoba and what a gem it is. Figures, thanks MLCC for another piss poor choice. Keep them coming","oakbluff","May 30, 2008"
3.38,3.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A white head with some lacing that stuck around. the colour was a bit more amber than apple juice, fairly clear liquid. Carbonation in evidence, slow and lazy. I happened to have this right after a session in the hot tub and the fruity nose was quite welcome, lemon lime fruit zest and all. The taste was similarly citrus fruit, a bit snappy, with a sour dough bread feel. Some green apples presence; not sugary at all, thanks for that. Overall, I found this refreshing and uplifting although not overly complicated, not bad for the first day of June after spending time in the garden and unwinding in the tub.","ThatWineGuy","Beers"

The beer poured a translucent orangy-red colour with a generous white bubbly head which quickly disappeared. The aroma was faintly sour apples. not as strong as others have suggested. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, almost creamy, and highly carbonated. The flavour wasn't all that sweet...very reminiscent of the crabapples I used to eat as a child on the way to school.
