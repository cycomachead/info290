4.34,-1.8,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It has a really solid blend of sourness verse funk and earth. I was a little surprised by the bitter herbal notes but that aspect of it was very similar (in my opinion) to fresh Drie Fonteinen. I cant wait to get into the bottled version of this.","stakem","Jun 16, 2014"
