I enjoyed it with a chicken and Swiss spin on a Philly Cheese Steak.  Yea, sure, that sounds like a misnomer or an oxymoron, but who cars, it was good, and a welcome break from Christmas preparations.","SLeffler27","Nov 11, 2014"

It would of removed some magic from the event to see hoarders line up with their friends and family to collect as many bottles as they could. Everyone at Quintessence was able to sample this wonderful beer, and there was no frenzy to get into the line for this beer.","omgrich","May 01, 2014"
