In this case, it feels like the sugary elements have “split” the beer down the middle: clear-cut sweetness vis-à-vis weak funky fruitiness. Personally, I would never want to revisit this beer, unless the brewery reverted to the oude geuze style by abandoning the overpowering candy sugar which really has killed off many more pleasant flavours one would expect from a glass of classic tart funky malt juice…","wl0307","Jul 03, 2013"

The flavor is sour and tart, although tartness more than sourness defines the profile. The fruitiness borders on sugary and is a deficit in this brew. It is not as cracklingly crisp as some other gueuze I have had, but it still snaps on the way, a little like champagne.","BeardedBoffin","Aug 16, 2011"

The body is medium with light carbonation, smooth yet dry, and it has a sweet, lingering finish.

The taste is much more expressive, lots of tart fruits, drying from the start for the mouth, some obvious Belgian yeastiness, lots of carbonation all adding to this effect of lambic-y goodness.

The smell is decent, with a good bit of wheat, some candi sugar and that classic wild tartness. The taste is not quite what I had hoped for. It has a bit of the real lambic 'bite' to it, but not enough for my taste, and it is further negated by an overbearing sweetness of apples and orange juice.

Its colour was a bit darker than I was expecting, pouring and orange copper with a very slight haze to it. The head was slightly off-white and loosely knit. It faded away rather quickly leaving behind a ring of lace around the edges and an abstract patch work of frost over the surface. CO2 streamed quickly upward, and for quite some time, actually. Smell seemed very typical for the most part, with special attention paid to the "sour" element that always seems to be present. Taste, too, seemed particularly sour, and delightfully sweet. Not bad.

The taste seems more tame than other lambics I've had. The others I've had seem more vinegary, or kombucha like, which I am told is desirable.

Definitely a musty (read: old damp room) smell, that actually works for this style. Sweet as well ... bittersweet fruits and straw. Palate is sweet and sour, but maybe the sweet wins out here. Slight Vinegar-like character which causes the mouth to water ... something I actually love in a Lambic. Fruity and quite smooth through the vinegar acidity. Warms to a smoother malt backbone. Finishes quite dry and lively with aggressive carbonation levels. Not being an expert in the Gueuze style, I can't say how it stacks up to it's competition, but I do know I like this on it's own merits. Best Lindeman's product I've had, by far.

The faint malt flavor do, however, begin to take on cola-like flavors that I did not particularly like. But the sweetness from that, makes the beer much more drinkable than expected, and giving the beer a more caramelized color.

The smell is a tart and smells like medicine. It has a very sharp, light, clean, and fizzy mouthfeel. The flavor is sweet and sour but very smooth; tasting like honey, wood (oak/hickory), and citrus. A good beer draws fruit flies and this was no exception (Had several unfortunate casualties). I am very skeptical in my early stages of trying Lambics and this one surprised me. It is quite a good beer. It has a nice blend of sweet and tart due to its mixture (Gueuze).","TheEclecticGent","Jan 20, 2006"

It isnt bad tasting, but it is very mild and reserved compared to most beers in this style. There is a tad of tartness, and a bit of the earthy flavor/aroma, but it remains pretty much balanced the entire time. If you dont know what a Gueuze istry this one before shelling out $20+ for a bottle of Cantillon. If you already like Gueuze, I would buy something elselike a Girardin, or an Oud Beersel or some such. This is like a pretend Gueuze.","SkeeterHawk","Nov 11, 2005"

I feel that the sweetness became slightly sourer towards the end, but it still finished crisp and refreshing. Definitely a must try for lambic fans everywhere.","sinistrsam","Nov 07, 2005"

This is a gueuze that my spouse would enjoy, which, I believe, eliminates it from being a part of the lambic family. The Lindemans' brews are like Belgian version malternatives. Of course, this is drinkable. There is nothing remotely threatening about this beer but the fear of the novice mispronouncing the name. This should be a complex melding of flavors, not an excellent choice to accompany your cake and ice cream.","pentathlete","Aug 25, 2005"

Flavor is sharp and tart, with a sour-apple candy sensation. Fruit sensation is not strong. Has gueuze flavor profile, but is the sweetest gueuze I have tried to date.

This is my first gueuze, so I don't have much to compare to, but it has the same sour character I associate he other lambics I've had. The beer is light to moderately in my mouth with a nice bubble carbonation. This would be a nice beer to present to someone that likes a sparkling wine to try and expand their horizons.

Tiny bubbles race to the surface, adding to its full, creamy white head. The retention is excellent and it leaves wide, creamy walls of lace. The nose is surprisingly sweet for the style with a touch of sour fruitiness over the traditional lambic characteristics (must, leather, barnyard, etc.). The body is thin, and it's crisp and zesty in the mouth due to it's natural carbonation; but it's also slightly drying and borderline astringent due to it's acidity. Its sweet and sour flavor hints at fruitiness upfront but warms to reveal a wheat-like maltiness and some subtle nutty character beneath. It finishes dry but with some sticky malt and short-lingering brett character. Overall, this is a fairly basic, restrained gueuze that should appeal to the masses. It's an excellent introduction to the style, and it offers immense drinkability to the initiated. Well worth trying or re-visiting.","NeroFiddled","Mar 30, 2004"

Taste was a nice combination of all of these with a winey cidery flavour dominating with the sourdough coming in at the mid and a citric bit of dryness at the end. Nice sour tart taste through out .The carbonation was nice and led to a good clean mouthfeel. Drinkabilty was above average. I dont think I could put away more than a couple of these, but It was definately a nice flavour. I know this takes some heat as not a real gueuze, but It was a good starting point.

Starts off mildly tart and gueuze-like with additional hints of green apple, but the mid-palate features notes of sweetness and sugar that aren't fitting. Finishes thin and watery with that residual sugar leaving a trail of sweetness behind. Mouthfeel is far from great, as the watery dimension is just too prevalent. Fairly drinkable just the same, but far from a favorite. This could be a good introduction to those new to gueuze as it's not overpowering, but why bother?
