4.06,-8.6,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Bottle from Tipples. Pours deep golden with a bit of orange and a small fizzy head on top. Aroma of big time sour funk, acid, oak, some sweet fruits like peaches and apples. Mmmm. Taste is bold and has plenty of malt sweetness, light fruits add depth, and there is plenty of sour funk to go around. Nice dry oaky tannins. Body is on the heavier side for the style, with plenty of lively, prickly carbonation, and a dry finish. This is really nice, and maybe it would be best side by side with the regular version. Overall I think I liked the regular version a bit better. Perhaps a little more age would funk this up, dry it out, and lighten things up a bit. But nevertheless, this is yummy.","BMMillsy","Mar 08, 2015"

4.49,1.1,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Just outstanding. I can't say to have any expertise on the actual aging potential of gueuzes, but this seems primed to have a lengthy and excellent lifespan. Aroma is outstanding, full of sweaty horseblanket and stone fruit notes with a touch of vanilla. It's got a deep mustiness already. On the palate this is revealed to largely be a product of the big oak flavors, revealing a slightly sweet and deeply tannic profile. As the brett works over time and dries this out I have hopes of true magnificence. But if it never does anything but get progressively older, I'll still enjoy this, a fair bit more than the regular.","errantnight","Feb 02, 2015"

Aroma is strong and filled with tart lemon and a little sweetness to it. Not any funkiness but maybe a little dry dust and a slight burn. Taste is not what I remember from the last bottle I had. A weird sour bitterness that I pick up on the back of my tongue. More lemon and a little orange peel. Some green apple, tons of oak, and the alcohol is there in the background. Mouth is a little light bodied but carb is good. Overall, I enjoy it but miss the funkiness of other Gueuze. This is more citrus rind than musty goodness.","RuckusDu","Jan 23, 2015"

The mid palate brings out the barrel character with deep, woody tannins, mildly woodsy, mild vanillin and a mild pear preserve note. Layered and structured, the finish brings out some salty and mushroomy flavors before the tannins take over, leaving a long, drying finish, sour with preserved lemons, grapefruit, a mild vinegar character. The strong oak tannins on the finish remind me of some unblended lambics (Broucsella and maybe the Boon Mariage Parfait?). Alcohol is reasonably well hidden, this beer is light in body, moderately carbonated and and fantastic on the palate. Excellent. I'm not sure this should be cellared, drink it fresh if you have it on hand.","DefenCorps","Jan 16, 2015"

4.6,3.6,,,,,,"pours a hazy orange with a slight head if poured correctly. smell of acidic goodness that is quite reminiscent of regular tilquin. taste is very similar as well but dare i say a tad better. body is fuller and the flavors are more pronounced. big acidity but thats what you get from the OG version too. booziness not detectable. IMO a slight improvement to an already terrific gueuze. this in my eyes is one of the best gueuzes you can buy in the USA and one you should snag off the shelves before it becomes too popular. great job!","Axnjxn","Nov 15, 2014"
