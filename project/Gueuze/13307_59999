4.67,22.9,4,5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"amazing, just downright awesome sour ale here, been looking forward to one day trying this for some time now. clay station hooked it up. maybe age has helped this, because its not scored real highly on here, but its drinking like a real champ. laic style sour, hazy blind but with a little pale orange in it and a short but permanent quarter inch of white bubbles that keep popping in the surface but being replace by new ones on the bottom. a wonderful nose, acidic and mouthwatering as they come, but also loaded with musty oak character and lactic tartness, as well as robust wheat malt. hard to beat this smell for me, its everything i look for in the style and nothing i don't. the flavor shows the richness and nuance of gueuze, like a blend that brings it all out, but as far as i know, this is unblended, which makes it that much more impressive. funk before sour on the palate, and its nowhere near as acidic as the nose suggests, but still puckers me up pretty good. drying mid tongue acidity, not sharp though, because the oak here is so enormous. its infused the beer with an earthen unity that carries all the way through. i am so impressed by the depth here, and all the body that i usually wish for in lambic types. it also has way more carbonation than most. short of explosive, but not by much, it remains infinitely drinkably partially due to that, but also in large part due to how darn intriguing it is. far better than so many of its variants with the fruit, which i think in some cases kill the crispness of this, kill its simplistic yet layered nature, wash out the subtleties. not here, bold and robust, but also reserved. i love everything about it, especially the long dry constantly changing finish. this is as good as any wild ale in the game.","StonedTrippin","Mar 14, 2014"

Lots of cheaper, tastier and easier to find options out there. Take the money you would have spent on this and buy a Hanssens gueuze.","Jonada","Dec 26, 2013"

This is a well-balanced sour, but very subtle in the sourness. I enjoyed this beer, but more of a sessionable or starter sour. Your wine friends will like this beer and your beer friends will most likely be let down by this beer.","kengetty","Aug 10, 2013"

3.98,4.7,4,4,4,3.75,4,"An actually approachable gueuze, in that the acidic nature isn't quite tooth-scrapingly tart, as the fruitiness is weirdly achieved sans guest fruit adjunct. The wood goes far here, at least in the subjugation of the funk, making for an overall pleasant walk in the park for the style. Worthy, and agreeably drinkable.","biboergosum","Beers"

An interesting aroma, but nothing crazier than some others from the style. It has a taste of grapes, sour qualities, hay and funk. Mouthfeel is light, a very dry finish which leaves you craving some water, but I dig it. This is a well done gueuze and from what I understand, the first "true gueuze" that Mikkeller has produced. It is well done and for those who I have a chance to try it, do so !","mltobin","Sep 27, 2012"

4.07,7.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice hazy light orange with a decent head that lingers. Wonderful smell, definitely know its a geuze. Thought the carbonation would have been a little better based on the pour, but it helps out the smooth initial taste and mouthfeel. The sour comes in at the end and is in no way overwhelming, just a nice finish. Not a bad first effort for a geuze, as it is in no way an easy style to pull off. Hope the Framboos is just as good!","madtrixter787","Aug 13, 2012"
3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O: a good gueze, although I wish it was a bit more sour and the oak notes weren't so up front, could have been a little bit more well balanced, but then I hold mikkeller to a higher standard then most I suppose.","PeterIngemi","Aug 07, 2012"

Lemon and lemon zest provide a light tartness. The flavor is a bit more oak forward, though still rather funky. Mildly tart, some grass, and moderate funk. Has a bit of a young homebrew sour flavor.","womencantsail","Jul 01, 2012"

4.06,6.8,5,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color beer with a super huge slightly off-white head with perfect retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of sour green apple notes with light funky notes also discernable. Taste is a semi-complex mix of green apple notes some light funky notes and subtle barnyard flavours. Body is about average with great carbonation. Well brewed and nicely drinkable and somewhat similar to Girardin with maybe a bit more acidity and less barnyard notes.","Phyl21ca","Dec 05, 2011"

3.91,2.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Actually very well done for a first lambic beer. The balance of tartness with a touch of fruitiness and some funk is very good and makes for an enjoyable beer. This isn't as full on as Cantillon or as complex as Drie Fonteinen.","dgilks","Aug 01, 2011"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"First of all this is totally new for i mean Mikkeller doing a Gueuze and i heard its his first attempt and brewed at Cantillion and it pours a murky golden orange hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head that stays and leaves a rim of lacing,the first smell i get which is quite dominant is sour green apples followed by musty funk,ripe bitter lemons and hay,the mouthfeel is light bodied,a tad creamy and very tart which suits perfectly and has tastes of dominant sour green apples,musty funk,sour lemons,a hint of grapefruit and finished with a mouthpuckering sherbet bittersweetness and overall for a first effort its bloody good and thats exactly why i love this brewer he just pushes boundaries and usually comes up trumps my hat goes off to him as i would buy this again cheers.","ADZA","Jul 25, 2011"
4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured an orangeish yellow, translucent with a foamy white head - 2+ fingers in height. Good retention. Nose is lemony, light oak and a light sweetness as well. Some funky notes and hints to some more tart notes that I hope become apparent in the palate. Taste is tart lemon, some breadinesss and a good balancing sweetness to keep the tartness in check . Slight oakiness near the finish. Medium high carbonation, with a moderate puckering to finish each sip. Sweeter than most gueuzes I've had, and very drinkable all around. I could easily revisit this.","liamt07","Jul 23, 2011"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep blonde colour, big white head, lots of lace. Smell is funky and citrusy, lots of fruit with nice yeasty and wheaty notes.
