Pours brilliant black to dark brown under a 3” tan cap. It is very creamy with an underlying sweetness with light roast – but no burnt flavors, dark sugars suggestive of light chocolate, faint fruit and spice on the palate. Less hop bitterness than expected. Medium body and a little more than medium on the carbonation. Not as hot or warming as your would expect for 9.5% abv. Very drinkable.","pat61","Jan 05, 2015"

4.25,1,,,,,,"The beer poured a pitch black with slight ruby highlights when held up to the light a and a slight tan head that left sufficient lacing.  The aroma was slightly piney but more resinous and citrus notes with sweet roasted malt backup as to be expected in a Black IPA. The taste exceptionally glided between dark roasty bitterness and piney, resinous hop bitterness that played off each other and kept my deeply coated palate guessing as to where all the flavors were coming from.  The citrus hop flavors peaked their head out from time to time as well and really accentuated the interplay between the dark roasted malts and hop bite.  There is almost a rye or roasted coffee tone deep in this monstrous beauty of a beer.  A really superb Black IPA that manages the line between roasty malts and bitter hoppiness with finesse, if you can say that about such a high abv brew.  Another great one from Odell.","brurevu","Nov 19, 2014"

Flavors are grapefruit forward, with a decent smoke overlay, subtle tropical fruit sweetness, and a bitter resinous hops highlight throughout.

3.95,-6.2,4,4,3.75,4.5,4,"Pours a dark brown color with a good sized brown head with pretty good retention. Definitely resembles a Stout. Good deal of lacing. Smells of lightly roasted chocolate and coffee, as well as sweet, dark fruit and light citrus hops The alcohol is definitely there. The taste reveals some slightly more tamely roasted malts (as compared to the aroma). Licorice and sweet molasses go along with the chocolate as it warms. The taste is harder to completely pinpoint than I had expected. A good amount of bitterness, but this is one beer that I would say could benefit from even more bitterness, which would've complimented (in my opinion) some of the fruit, molasses, and overall sweetness. Incredibly easy to drink- I could probably down 3-4 of these in an hour, which is impressive considering the ABV (second straight time I've had that sentiment regarding a beer from Odell). Overall, a little bit less than what I was hoping for, but if you're looking for a balanced taste, with high ABV and drinkability, this one is a good bet.","majorbase2","Oct 08, 2014"

Extremely dark with only the hint of hops that one would expect. This is like a mix of Odell's Myrcenary with Lugene's. I feel like Odell should advertise this as some imperial stout IPA as that is the best description I can think of. The best food pairing I can imagine is some barbecued brisket. Fantastic beer that merged my friend's favorite flavor with mine. Highly recommend for a stout lover trying to get into IPAs.","ANiklaus","Aug 05, 2014"
4.43,5.2,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Appearance: Near perfect for me. I enjoy milk/imperial stouts, and I was not expecting to like this beer. The color is very dark and the head is quite nice. Smell: Notes of chocolate and milk. Again, not what I expected, but I loved it. As the beer warms to room temperature, the hoppiness of the IPA comes to the forefront. Taste/mouthfeel: This is a unique beer. At the pour, the beer was chilled and I very much enjoyed the stout-eske characteristics of malt and body. As the beer rose in temperature, I both smelled and tasted more hops, which I personally did not care for as much. My first sip was perhaps the best; the flavors all came at me in progression for a hell of a ride, finishing with the signature hoppiness of an IPA that I expected. Overall, this beer intrigued me. It strikes me as a hybrid of a stout and an IPA. I will likely try it again just for another chance to decipher all that is going on in its taste.","sheeley","Aug 05, 2014"

4.16,-1.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Pours a deep black with dense creamy tan head. Heavy lacing left behind and great head retention. Nose starts with some nice herbal hops along with some bright fruity notes. This is paired with a nice robust roasted barley note. Taste is herbal up front with plenty of roasted notes and piney hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of the black IPA since they often seem gimmicky. This one melds the dark malts nicely with the hop profile and makes for a delicious beer.","homebrew311","Mar 05, 2014"

You feel the alcohol more than you can taste it. I'm sure it could creep up on you pretty quick. Taste is malty goodness, chocolate, hop and more hop. Great beer from a world class brewery.

I wish there was a bit more hop presence, as the crazy blend of floral, herbal hops and earthy, roasty malts is what I love about the "black IPA" style in the first place.

True to style, the earthy qualities and hops shine through, backed by a nice roast and black malt scent. Very well done. Taste is roast malt, a bit of alcohol mingling in the background and finish, an ample level of piney hops, citrus pith and grapefruit, some very faint hints of coffee and sweetness and a nice earthiness in the background. It's a very good set of flavors, hoppy yet roasty, bitter with an earthy hint. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation and some alcohol burn with an oily-slick finish. Very good, quite nice to drink. Overall this is a good black IPA. It's got the hops, it's got the earthiness and it's got the roastiness to compete with others in it's class.","Auraan","Oct 30, 2013"

The flavor mirrors the aroma, lots of dark roast coffee and big malty sweetness.

Nice and resinous, with the standard grapefruit, espresso, and dark chocolate aromas of a "Black IPA". Taste is similar, perhaps a bit closer to a hoppy stout then a"Black IPA". Chocolate, dark malt, espresso, grapefruit rind, and resinous hops. Nice. Mouthfeel is pretty full, with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. Pretty decent beer, surprised to see the ABV on this, as it's surprisingly drinkable.","jsanford","Jan 23, 2013"

The result is a very pleasant, sippable beer that features a dry close with mild stickiness lingering along the palate. Despite being able to taste the ethanol slightly, I feel little to none in the nostrils or across the palate, but a slight burn on the back of the throat that's almost negligible. The heavy smoothness of this beer is excellent.","falloutsnow","Jan 21, 2013"

As the name implies, no light shines through this black brew. The head is tan and thick, lasting for the whole experience and leaving a beautiful lacing. The aroma is very pleasant, with lots of hop complexity. The Mountain Standard is very balanced in the flavor department. It has good malt flavor, but is not too sweet or too big. The hops are well refined, adding to the flavor, but not overpowering it. In a time where brewers push beers into a statement category with big abrasive brews, the Mountain Standard is a great beer that impresses you rather than overwhelms you.

Aroma is a little piney with hint of citrus and some sweetness from the grains. The taste is smooth a fairly light, a bit different than the nose. The grain is stronger than the hops and has a moderately strong roast. The hop flavor is mostly in the finish with a bitterness that competes with the grains and a light pine and citrus that lets it be smooth a malty but just enough bite to be an IPA. It is a clean beer with no off or extremely strong stand out flavors, just nice and mellow throughout. For the strength it does not show it. Overall a solid black IPA.","CuriousMonk","Dec 28, 2011"

3.78,-10.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours dark brown, almost opaque, one finger tan head, no visible carbonation due to hue, minimal lacing. There's not much going on in the nose, waited for the brew to warm up when it took on a mild roast and grassy note character, some vanilla notes from the barrel aging. Pretty smooth, some mild bitterness once it warmed, floral and grassy hops, I picked up some caramel, fairly well balanced. Mouthfeel a bit on the thin side, good effervescence,alcohol is still pretty prominent, sticky. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed, I'd been setting on this for a couple of months which may have led to the hops fading a bit. But we ended up doing a side by side with Turmoil, and this beer ended up far short of that world class CDA. Worth a try, but at this price point I won't be buying another.","jdense","May 27, 2011"

Massive thanks goes out to jmkratt for sending me this bottle! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and slight roasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Probably the standout of Hobo Tasting #4 in my opinion (not sure about what Mike thinks). Had a great balanced flavor going on here as well as a great aroma to back it up. We even let the owner/brewmaster of RJ Rockers sample a little bit of this one and he agreed that it was a damn fine beer. This one had all the citrus I could ask for in an IPA as well as the roastiness you would get in a nice Porter. Not much more you can ask for in my opinion. This was probably one of the best examples of a Black IPA (Black Ale, whatever...) that I have had to-date. An absolute must try for anyone, fan of the style or not.","thagr81us","Feb 18, 2011"

4.44,5.5,4,5,4.5,4,4,"As soon as I saw this I wondered what "double black" implied and I found my answer as soon as I started to pour this one. Pours impressively black for the style, looks more like an RIS, with some dark garnet tones around the edges when held up to the light. Pour produces a HUGE, foamy, tan head that recedes slowly and leaves a wall of lacing down the side of the glass. Nose is surprising considering how it looks as there's a potent citrusy, resiny, hop aroma front and center with some roasty maltiness in the background. Taste is equally surprising. Definitely as there are plenty of pine and citrus hop flavors with a hint of mint as well. The roasted malts hang out in the background to provide some pleasant balance to a very hop-centric brew. Mouthfeel again proves that looks can be deceiving. Clean crisp finish and nicely carbonated. I actually expected this to be a bit overcarbonated given the crazy head on this one. Incredibally easy drinking for 9.5%. Really my only complaint with this is it is a bit on the pricey side. However, I decided to treat myself with this one and I am glad I did as it went perfectly with a Thanksgiving feast.","alli4051","Nov 26, 2010"

When drunk quickly after pouring the beer it is excessively foamy and the texture manages to accentuate some hot alcohol notes as well. This beer has some potential, and I really like the idea of Colorado grown hops, but the execution comes off a touch more lackluster than I was hoping. This is certainly by no means bad, in fact it is quite drinkable, it just needs a little work.","Gueuzedude","Mar 07, 2010"
4.15,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep ruby red... or mahogany as the label calls it, with a huge 2 finger light tan head. Head recedes but leaves excellent lacing. A huge sweet citrus aroma conflicts with the dark appearance of the beer, but smells delicious. I love the cascade and chinook hops, and come out beautifully in the nose of this. The aroma is so strong, that I am surprised by the flavor, very much in line with the aroma, but not as intense as it had suggested. Luckily the malt backbone is strong enough for the intense usage of hops, it makes the beer taste like a citrus candy! There is little complexity there beyond the hops, so I would say this one is best as fresh as possible. This beer rests a bit tart in your mouth, and this tartness impacts its drinkability. In the end, another uniquely hopped up style from Odell, much like the India Barleywine and Red Ale. I like the hops they use, so its another winner for me.","bhalter8","Feb 14, 2010"

A nice whaff of floral hops in the nose undercut a bit by some caramel maltiness. First sip is crisp, floral. A nice malt backbone, caramel and sticky bread. Malty finish.
