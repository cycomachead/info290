I like this better than the imperial pils, and fully support anything involving chef morimoto, his work in the kitchen is unrivaled.","StonedTrippin","Mar 13, 2013"

Fairly smooth, not overly carbonated so pretty easy on the tongue. Nothing overwhelmingly present that really stands out but some mild fruit flavor, mild hops, and what seems a slight spice flavor. Low in alcohol so between that and the easy taste the drinkability stays at a decent level. Wouldn't be a problem to have a few. One of Rogue's better offerings I would say.

The blend of flavors is very unique and rich. The maltiness is almost overbearing but the combination of nut, fruit and floral hops keeps the flavor rich and varied.

Mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side of medium. Overall I think I liked the regular Morimoto soba beer better, but this was fair as well.

Very nutty flavor with sweetness at the start that moves to more savior notes with a touch of soy sauce in the middle and finishes dryer and with some spice.

That is something totally different. Burnt malts lay the ground work for the flavor, supporting the sugary beginning, bready buckwheat middle, and hoppy finish. The hops and the sugar stick on the toung for 5 or 8 seconds after the swallow. I don't know much about Soba's, but this beer is a bit thin for the flavor.

The hops make an appearance in the taste slightly. This beer is rather dry. It is sort of hard to drink because of how dry it is. It makes my mouth feel a little weird. I really cant explain how, just a little off. It is overcarbonated. It leaves a bitter aftertaste. This beer would probably make a bad session beer. Although it is low in alcohol, the aggressive, dry taste might be undesirable to some. I doubt I will have the desire to drink this one again. If you see it, maybe you should buy a different type.

3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer emerges from the 22-ounce brown bottle a deep raspberry color with a stupendous frothy light tan head that linger long, after its eventual demise the resultant lace forms a thick and sticky skirt to surround the glass. Nose has a nice toasted grain aroma with a sweet nut-like tone, fresh and clean, a hint of caramel, start is somewhat sweet with a decent grain profile, top is light to medium in feel. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops spicy and the aftertaste somewhat dry with a bit of residual bitterness, a drinkable beer.","Gusler","May 04, 2005"
3.55,-2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Light bodied, good carbonation, with a very wet refreshing mouthfeel. The taste is a malt that is rich but isn't particularly toasty. Alot of hops flavors come across. This brew is nothing if not interesting. I'm sure I would drink it again, sometime.","MrSeth","May 03, 2005"
4.25,16.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Dark clear ruby. One finger sized brown head. Very creamy looking and long lasting. Lace is better than average. Nice thick aroma. It's got chocolate, roast and char, but also fruit and hop tones like currants and peach. The mouthfeel is quite creamy and lends a good drinkability to the whole equation. Body is about medium. The flavor is chock full of goodies. Rich chocolate and coffee tones on the palate blend with the weird, but nice, soba accents. And a lingering hop bitterness adds the final punch. Nice combination and quite refreshing as well.","Bighuge","Apr 24, 2005"
3.8,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours dark -- not quite black, but close. Dark roasty malts are the most notable elements of the aroma. Slightly nutty with hints of caramel. Flavor is nutty and malty as well, with just enough bitterness to balance. Roasty, toasty and yummy, with a nicely lingering aftertaste. Overall a drinkable beer but not enthralling by any means. Not Rogue's best offering.","mzwolinski","Beers"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 oz. served chilled. The beer pours a deep deep brown with tinges of red and has a 1 inch tan head that leaves nice lacing. Hops, nuts, licorice, and butter in the nose - the aroma could be stronger. The flavor is very nutty and roasted with notes of coffee, licorice, and butter. It is very crisp with a medium body and has a decent hop bitterness. Seems kinda like a brown ale with a twang. Initially the carbonation is tingly but becomes smoother by the end of the bomber. It's good, but for the money I'll go for something better.","mmmbeer","0"

3.06,-16.2,4,3,3,3,3,"Overall: Hmmmm.listed as a Fruit/Vegetable beerbut I couldnt help feel that this tasted and drank a little like a below average Dark Mild. Not bad.but I think Ill pass on this one again if I see it. Very Average and bloody boring.Zzzz..yawn.","TheLongBeachBum","Mar 05, 2005"
3.1,-15.1,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured from the 22oz bottle a seemingly black hue, but deep brown highlights emerge when it is held up to the light. A half-inch, tan-colored head hangs around for a few minutes before retreating into a thin ring on top of the beer. Interesting aroma of roasted malt, caramel, and and a touch of dark fruit. The palate is strange - lightly sweet, with a touch of malt and no discernable hop presence up front. Notes of root vegetable, molasses, and buckwheat come through mid-palate, and a light hop bitterness emerges in the back of the mouth. Light body is a bit too thin. Interesting, to say the least, although I'm not sure I'd drink this very often.","ElGordo","Feb 24, 2005"
3.76,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"22 oz bomber purchased at Peabody's in Boone, NC, for $3.99. Pours a very dark chestnut brown, not quite opaque, with a large, creamy beige head that retains well. Lots of sticky patch lace all over the glass. Aroma is subdued, with roasty and grainy malts, a hint of cocoa powder, and a note of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and light medium bodied. The flavor is unique, and difficult to describe. Earthy buckwheat nuttiness and some herbal tea notes. A hint of mild coffee, and a restrained hops bitterness. Finishes crisp and refreshing, with mild hops bitterness. Goes down smooth and easy, and is very drinkable. Very interesting!","merlin48","Feb 15, 2005"

4.08,11.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Quite tasty indeed. Big roasty presence keeps this going, especially when paired with the fine hop bitterness. A very easy drinker.","Skidz","Feb 07, 2005"
4.38,20,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a really interesting beer, reminding me at times of a mix between Guinness Export Stout & Rogue's Morimoto Soba Ale. It has that sharp burnt caramel bitterness of the Guinness and the medium body, hoppy intensity and residual sugars of the Soba. At any rate, this is a really good beer, but I think I could only finish one of these bombers at a time. Good stuff John!","Mitchster","Dec 29, 2004"

3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Had this on tap at Rich O's Public house. Pours a dark brown color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma had hints of roasted malts, but it was very subdued. The flavor was a bit weak too. Reminded me a lot of the standard Buckwheat ale that Rogue makes, but with a bit more roastiness. A nice beer overall, but seemed a bit thin and weak in the flavor. Great flavor, but it could use more if it.","clvand0","Oct 26, 2004"
3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Sampled at Rich-O's last night. The beer came off the tap a nice dark brown, with just some ruby hues at the edges to let me know its not black. One finger of tan head sat atop the beer throughout the drink. The nose was a little hard to dissect, being a touch weak, but I got a nice roasted character, with a slight coffee as well. The flavor was also only slightly roasty, wtih a really nice caramel sweet base and a touch of hops on the finish. The feel was a touch thin for my liking, but very smooth and easy to consume. This was another nice offerng from Rogue. A good way to start the night.","kmpitz2","Oct 23, 2004"

3.58,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability  I enjoyed this offering from Rogue. I dont know what kind of vegetable it was supposed to be, though. I saw it as a nice, low-ABV, very drinkable dark ale.","RoyalT","Aug 15, 2004"
3.69,1.1,4,2.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a very interesting ale, to say the least. I had this one with a few friends in Philadelphia. This ale was a dark black/brown colour with ruby edges. The aroma was interesting. Although it was reminiscent of the regular soba ale, it also had some roasted notes, and some chocolate tones. The smell also had an odd aroma that I can not describe. This particular aroma kind of ruined the smell of this beer for me. Although the smell was not my favorite, this beer tasted awesome. Fruity roasted, and very stout-like at times with plenty of fruit notes as well. The mouthfeel was pretty creamy and smooth, but perhaps a bit thin and the drinkability was nice. An interesting one from Rogue.","francisweizen","Aug 15, 2004"
