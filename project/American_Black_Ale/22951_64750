3.93,-3,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours pitch black with a thin foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are mild.  Has a malty, licorice, raisin aroma.  Smooth, silky taste.  Can definitely taste licorice, maybe some slight chocolate and raisins.  You can definitely detect the booziness.  It has a slightly astringent aftertaste with some hoppy bitterness.  Good beer, but not much of a black licorice fan.","jngrizzaffi","Jan 24, 2015"

4.15,2.5,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall, what a great way to commemorate one year on the market.  Their standard Hoppy Feet did wonders for advancing the style of “American Black Ale”, or however you feel comfortable calling it.  It showcases a dense malt base with a floating crown of fresh hoppiness.  Here, we truly get the enhanced version of this, although it is most noticeable in the bitterness and depth of the flavor profile.  They also take the abv through the roof, and just a pint of this 10.0% beast can send an advocate reeling.  Despite this, the beer drinks with a definite smoothness, allowing you every opportunity to appreciate the flavors as they continually drift by the taste buds.  It is nice that Clown Shoes appreciates their roots, but even nicer that they take care of the consumer by literally building off their prior successes to offer something even better.  Good on you, Clown Shoes.","TheBrewo","Sep 26, 2014"

Flavor is an initial wallop of hop bitterness followed closely by roasted malt, fig, raisins, and plum. The aftertaste hastily returns back to a strong, bitter hop fade.

Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

As I draw in the aroma, the bouquet of citrus flavors that springs forth is astounding. Extended contemplation of the nose finds a notable presence of figs, raisins, coffee beans, and cherries...all interwoven in the mix. The taste teases my palate with an initial, syrupy molasses, only to overwhelm it an instant later with a sharp, yet floral bitterness reminiscent of pine. The mouth feel is moderate, and surprisingly, the beer does not seem to coat the inside of my mouth excessively. The alcohol heat is minimal, but the sensation once swallowed is filling. The finish is quite dry, and hints at having a dash of licorice within, accompanied by a pleasurable tingling. Overall, this beer is very gratifying, honing in on many of my preferred craft beer flavors. This experience mirrors my others with Clown Shoes- great job once again!","Neorebel","Jan 18, 2013"

This beer pours a "pitch brown" color with a finger of head that quickly recedes to the end of the glass. The aroma is a nice piney hop over a very strong caramel, chocolate, and roasted malt base. The taste really skews pretty close to a lighter bodied imperial stout with a strong hop dose coursing through every bit. The malt bill is very intense here, offering huge roast and chocolate flavors that course over the very oily hops. It's very big and maybe a little too brash, with it almost feeling like a tug-of-war between the hops and the malts, with a different side winning every sip.","shand","Oct 27, 2012"

Citrus pith, resin, dark chocolate and coffee aroma. Smells delicious and yes, this is tasty. Coffee and semi sweet chocolates intermingled with citrus and resin hop are the predominant flavors. There is a pleasant roasted toffee malt presence in the background. Sweetness early on the palate is washed away by a solid dose of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel and body remind that this is a black DIPA and not a hoppy imperial stout. Medium with zesty carbonation. Alcohol shows up a little bit in the finish, along with ample bitterness reminiscent of black coffee, baker's chocolates, resin and citric pith hops. Good stuff.","JackieTH","Oct 07, 2012"

Just a brief illusion since resiny & oily hop bitterness –overwhelms malts- lingers into a dry bitter finish. Moderate fruit tartar on the aftertaste. Refreshing. ABV well masked while drinking but definitely present to your head. Nice beer.","GONZALOYANNA","Jun 10, 2012"
3.71,-8.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass, bottled 10/11. Pours a slick black, with a three inch dark tan head, with lacing everywhere. Smell is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, pine, and a hint of citrus. Taste is more mellow than when I had it 8 months ago and it was more bitter, do to the aggressive hops. Very strong expresso, with some bitter hops still hanging on. The body is on thick side, plenty of carbonation for its size, not overly dry, and very drinkable for such a large brew. I enjoyed its aggressive nature when it was younger, but many might enjoy it more now that the flavors have mellowed. This is a very good beer, like I said my preference is fresh.","SawDog505","Jun 05, 2012"

Although I feared that a 6 month old hoppy beer would be less than spectacular, I was pleasantly surprised. The hops were still vibrant and flavorful. There is great complexity and balance to this beer. Dangerously drinkable as well. I really hope they make this beer again, although the "anniversary" status doesn't suggest they will.

It bitter up front then fades into the toasted part all to end on a bitter note. The end is the beginning is the end. Not super complex but damn tasty. Smooth as hell mouth feel. No rough edges an the carbonation is just right. Pretty much the best American Black Ale Iv'e had. Never really been a fan. This one right here sets the standards in my opinion.

Thin malt bill it seems and only one type of hop characteristic. Ok at first, pretty average flavors but then man does it get intense. In a bad way. So much bitterness and astringency. Too much hop bitterness of sticky pine resin and another layer of overwhelming black patent bite. It just clings to your tongue and sticks to the back of your throat.

The hops were very noticeable in the piney and earthy smell. There was a touch of chocolate at the end of each whiff, betraying the presence of dark malts. The taste was perfectly straddling the line between a stout and a DIPA. The hops were clearly there in the bitterness up front, which was followed by a different, more astringent bitterness from the roasting of the grains. There was also a small amount of sweetness that alternated between molasses and rock candy. The aftertaste was very bitter, and lingered long after the beer had already passed the throat. Very silky mouthfeel with no harshness. Phenomenal beer from a brewery whose products are newly being distributed around here. I will be back for more of your beers very soon.","rajendra82","0"

4.85,19.8,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"(9/7/2011) Clown Shoes Hoppy Feet 1.5 is a cola black ale with a huge, foamy, turbanado sugar colored head that stays put and leaves fancy lacing all down the glass. It has an aroma of pine, lemon and burnt sugar. Tons of hop juiciness is detected. It's full bodied and creamy on the tongue. The finish is pretty chewy and it leaves the mouth a little raw. This beer is jarringly bitter, raising my heart rate, quickening my breath, dropping my jaw. Nice. The bitterness has a big juniper quality. It is resiny, wooden, almost smokey. There's light sweetness and almost a hint of melanoids. It's blurringly bitter, hot, boozy syrup. The blackness doesn't give a hint of coffee, but there may be a blackstrap flavor to this. This is not for the hoi polloi. It would kill them. This is a beer for you, Mister Beer Snob. Someone used some science to get a fluid that packed with this much flavor into your mouth and I'm impressed with that. These Clown Shoes guys are off the handle.

When swallowed the beer is quite bitter and leaves a resiny and citric taste. The dark taste is subtle but roasted. Together with the bitterness the roast is bitter.

Magnificent light brown head of several fingers, sticky, chunky and generous lacing with excellent retention. Nose has some faint tropical fruits, predominantly pineapple. Some pine among other hops notes. Lots of chocolate, cocoa powder and sugary dark fruits, with a slight suggestion of alcohol. Taste starts roasty with dark chocolate, brown sugar and some subtler tropical hop notes, even compared to the nose. More sugary dark fruits. Great malt flavour, and the hops compliment and add to it quite well. Full, but not substantially heavy mouthfeel and a really creamy texture. Relatively low carbonation, and the alcohol is practically invisible. A stunning black ale, I can only imagine this being even better if fresh. A great introduction to this brewery for me.","liamt07","Nov 03, 2011"

The only thing that the original had over this one was a bit more fresh hops in the smell but that's just fine. It poured just as black with a crisp white, fast fading head. Lacing hangs on though. The smell is mildly piney, very roasty and then a tad chocolatey. Taste is fantastic dry pine and bitter dark chocolate with the faintest expresso in the background. The hops hang on to the tounge and the perfectly roasted malts balance them out to a t. This needs to go head to head with stone ssr ale.

Taste starts out with more bitter hop flavors of pine and grapefruit before moving on to the roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. A very nice progression, the hop bitterness gives way nicely to the roasted malt bitterness, and it lasts for some time on the palate.

I've only had a couple of Black IPAs that i have thought captured What i think should be the essence of this "new" category. Black malt, I think, and chocolate revealed itself early along with the hops an alcohol. Well integrated and the hop finish was strong as an IPA should be.

4.47,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Considering this costs more than a third more than standard Hoppy Feet, I was hoping Hoppy Feet 1.5 would be at least 1.5 times better; it's highly unusual to be disappointed by a beer of this quality. It's essentially the same beer and as they say: all cats look the same in the dark. I called Hoppy Feet one of the best Black IPAs so that certainly makes this one of the best too, but don't pay the extra dinero if you don't have to.","biegaman","Apr 24, 2011"

3.8,-6.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D - This is a pretty solid Black Ale. Not sure if I prefer this over the regular Hoppy Feet, but that may be because this isn't the freshest bottle. I may try the second batch that made it to Chicago in late March. Still, it's one of the better Clown Shoes offerings I've tried.","MasterSki","Apr 18, 2011"

The aroma and flavor bring roast, hops, chocolate, coffee. The flavor is very nice, well balanced, and finishes with a pleasant hop bitterness. Alcohol presence well disguised. Overall, a good brew. I would have this again.","Huhzubendah","0"

4.06,0.2,5,4,4,4,4,"O/D-This is a big beer, so a bomber is plenty for me. Would have loved to try this fresh to see how powerful the bitterness was at its peak. Still, one of my favorite American Blacks/Cascadian/Black IPA/whatever its called. I think Clown Shoes is an underrated brewery, and this beer only proves my belief.","VelvetExtract","Mar 21, 2011"
4.97,22.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Overall, this is an amazing style beer. I had tried a sample of this about 3-4 months ago, and even in that short time, this beer has evolved into something that I really dig. It at first was too bitter for me, but it smoothed out and the balance was as close to perfect as I've seen. Awesome beer. I hope I get another one at that stage in its life!","ambluhm","Mar 20, 2011"
4.73,16.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Update: Bottled dated end of March, I got a fresh one and it was amazing. Much more hops and balance, a true Black IPA!!!","wburch1967","Mar 15, 2011"
3.33,-17.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours nearly black with a light tan head and some good spotty lacing. The nose brings forward some piney hops and a bit of roast. There is a mild earthiness to the nose as well. The flavor has many of the same characteristics, but also has a bit too much alcohol flavor. Quite a lot too much, actually. Bitterness and alcohol layer with a medium body. Lots of bitterness carries through the finish. Decent, but not something I would seek out again.","Thorpe429","Mar 13, 2011"
3.93,-3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Easy drinking for the ABV. One of the better examples I have had of this style. Really nice and at a great price point. They should make this one year round as it is a nice beer and continue to tweak it.","aerozeppl","Mar 12, 2011"
4.43,9.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"If you are going to brew this style, hops need to be forward, but not overbearing. This example strikes a great balance. Check it out!","Brad007","Mar 12, 2011"

4.25,4.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Looks nice. Very dark, nearly black, with a tan cap that really lasted. Tons of foamy lacing clung to the glass in solid sheets. Hoppy aroma, pine and citrus, raw powdery hops (like breaking pellets apart), but with a lot of chocolate and toffee notes as well. Bitterness was strong, kind of sharp, lots of citrus flavour and toffee/molasses. Light roast and pine, malt and caramel. Alcohol flavour and warmth lingered. Some astringency from the dark malts, carbonation was on the creamy side, full bodied but not heavy. I liked this. Powerful but still quite drinkable for a big beer.","DrJay","Feb 13, 2011"

The beer itself blew me away. Dark black with a dark tan head that doesn't fall very fast. The smell is chocolate, pine, grapefruit, and all other sorts of malt and hop good stuff. The taste is a phenomenal blend of dark chocolate, roast, grapefruit and a lingering bitterness. One of my favorite beers... ever. I bought six and am going to see howm a few age!","BeerMusketeer","Beers"

4.63,14.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"M/D: Big, thick, viscous body, carbonation is low. Drinkability is scary on this one. For the hop and alcohol level in this, it drinks like a normal IPA/BIPA. Very good beer.","NCSUdo","Dec 31, 2010"

This is a big Black IPA, which is becoming my favorite style because it basically blends my two favorite styles (IPA and Stout), but it isn't overpowering. I would recommend that you keep this beer for a little while before drinking, I was just overly excited to try it, but I will be going back for another to lay to rest for a few months. Excellent offering, excited to try more from Clown Shoes.","mavbrew","Beers"
