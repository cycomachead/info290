3.8,-0.3,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Interesting. Dark amber black when held to light, tan head about 1.5 inches poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pub glass.  Moderate lacing on glass.  Herbal pine and smoked nutty nose.  Smoky nutty malt flavor dominates hoppy bitterness creating an interesting and surprising contrast.  Not unpleasant but to me, it looks and smells better than it tastes.  Mouthfeel is muddled, somewhat soft for an IPA but the bite seems to come from the carbonation and smokiness of the dark roast malt than from the hop bitters.","MDHopster","Feb 19, 2015"

Taste is of pine and smokiness, again typical of a black IPA. Mouthfeel is light and watery, Carbonation is just right (a hint more could even be taken). Overall, nothing great, but with a limited craft beer selection at the local gas station it'll do.","anthony23cippy","Sep 22, 2014"

Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost gritty mouthfeel. Virtually non existent hop aroma makes me want to call this a porter or dry stout.

Definitely intriguing. The flavor is much better thankfully. A mellow arrangement of chocolate, roasted grains and grassy hops. Medium in body with a good amount of carbonation to distinguish it from a stout. A bit too herbal for my preference, but not a bad example of the style by any means.","facundoCNB","Feb 16, 2014"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark amber-brown into black coloring with a frothy, filmy, low profile, light tan head that quickly disipates across the surface. Aromas of roasted grains, citrus highlights of grapefruit and tangerine, and a resiny, rich hops presence. Not overpowering on the nose, and very well balanced. Flavors of roast and hops hit the palate at the same time, with a bitter campfire balancing the bitter, floral, and tree sap punch of the hops. Some of the citrus shines through on the mid-tongue, allowing a break from the more intense flavors you get on the first sip. The aftertaste is more bitter, and slightly tangy, with the citrus and hops now taking the driver's seat. Smooth bodied, with a clean, slightly drying finish.

First taste was actually a little rough as the hops actually flew out of the bottle and assaulted my poor taste buds. Drinking straight from the bottle, about a quarter of the way in, the taste softened a bit (or my tongue was numbed) either way, the OCB was evolving into a very drinkable beverage. Not quite sure what the aftertaste reminds me of but it is pleasant and does not leave the harsh wash some IPAs do. I imagine it would go well with a peppered cheese snack if you’re into that kind of thing. Overall, an above-average entry and one I wouldn’t hesitate to enjoy again!","TheRougeBastard","Jun 22, 2012"

It contains the right amount of hops to be considered an IPA, but not too many which would take away from the roasted malt profile. I've seen a number of reviewers saying the roasted malt in this beer left a burnt taste in there mouth. This didn't occur to me, maybe they changed their recipe recently.

It kicks around some hops here and there, and is a little more strong on the roasted malts. This is also my first time with Otter Creek, I think. I got it pretty cheap at Trader Joe's, so not the massive investment that comes occasionally with some others. In general I'd say it more or less met my expectations, but I'd have been a little happier with something a little stronger and a little bolder. It's now advertised as year round; I'll probably look elsewhere though for some variety.","andrewm190","Sep 27, 2011"

Aromas are delightfully hopping, with lots of citrusy and evergreen needle notes, with a good amount of charred character. Good flavors that consistent with the those but more complex due to a sweeter, toffee taste on the mid-palate. Lingering notes of coffee and orange zest. A very tasty beer.

2.44,-36,3,4,2,3,1,"I wonder why these black beers have such a propensity to created such a big, dense head. Here, it was two rocky fingers of deep-mocha head with enviable retention. Color was ... talk about truth in advertising ... jet black. There was no light penetration whatsoever. That's OK since some of my friendliest beers are Black. They CAN come over to my house any time. In fact, some of them are really liked by my sister. She's into Black. Nose was initially bursting with piney hops, but a second whiff gave me smoke and dark chocolate. This is what bothers me about the style - it is like the old Reese's commercial - "Hey, you got your chocolate in my peanut butter! No, man, you got my peanut butter on your chocolate!" with the tag line being "Two great tastes that taste great together." Yeah, well, keep your roasted malts OUT of my AmeriCAN IPAs, dang it. Mouthfeel was medium but there was a fistfight on my tongue. Smoke then bitter then chocolate then more bitter until the melange tasted like a hangover morning. This is NOT my bag, baby! What happened - some genius got bored and thought that this would be a good idea? Epic fail! The finish left me gasping for breath and not in a good way. It tasted like the fire in the hops plant that caused the dry spell a few years back. Jeez-O, man. Color me not a fan.","woodychandler","May 26, 2011"

Taste of bitter, piney hops up front...if you weren't expecting such a dark ale to be hoppy, you will be surprised. Mild essence of citrus zest just noticeable, pine resin, grass, and a good malt roastiness to follow, but with the hops ever-present throughout.

A light roast that has a touch of char to it with some cocoa powder leads off with a minty, spruce, herbal hop profile taking over down the homestretch.

Liquid color certainly lives up to its billing, black and opaque, even if not “dense” in appearance, thin orange rust influence at the glass bottom. The nose is a pleasing mélange of malts and hops with cocoa powder, mocha, ginger snaps, walnuts and then tangerine zest, green hay and grass, wildflowers and a glance of apricot, red apple, cherry fruit scents, good stiffness and length. Medium-bodied, too tightly woven to be heavier, plus the carbonation has a steady, lifting quality which prevents too much soaking in. More overt roast here, at once plays up its overall bitterness while emphasizing mocha, cocoa, molasses, dark chocolate. That tangerine to white grapefruit element keeps the energy high while adding a bit of needed sweetness. Pepper and clove spice keep it lively, the herbaceousness stays in check. Not as floral here, however, the apricot, peach, apple fruit a tick higher. Dry finish with good grip and palate coverage. Excellent example of a category growing in popularity.","farrago","Apr 15, 2011"

Taste big citrus hops with a big toasted malty over tone that ends with a nutty and/or chocolate finish. Lite to medium mouth feel, watery, a tad bitter.

4.05,6.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a nice one finger head. The colors are very interesting, because the body is not black (like the bottle indicated it would be), it's like a dark dark dark brown, it's very close to being black, but it is brown. I say the color is weird because the head is pretty dark, I usually only notice dark heads in pitch black beers, oh well. The head has faded a little bit now, it looks like it's leaving good lacing though. It looks like a very yummy beer, I would like a bigger head, but whatever. Man, I love black IPA'S, this beer smells like it has just a perfect balance of hops and malts, as perfect as you can get, they smell just so well blended together, no aroma dominates. On some sniffs you get that chocolate malt smell, and on other sniffs you get that crisp hop smell. I'm excited to taste this because it smells so good, but then again, most black IPA's smell good. The only thing not great about the smell is that it's not too complex, but who cares? It smells great. The first thing I notice is a nice big mouthfeel on this, I love it when my beers have a big body and mouthfeel on them. Is it the biggest mouthfeel ever? No, but it's an IPA, so a good mouthfeel, however big it is, is impressive. I then notice the taste, which is just like the smell, perfectly blended hops and malts, really really tasty. I mean it's very simple, but it's just really well done. I can't give it style points, but I can give it plenty of brew points! There is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, at all. If it were a little more complex, I would consider giving it a few 5's. As it is though, great beer, great flavor, super well done!","MaltsOfGlory","Mar 30, 2011"

It seems like the roasted malts keep the aroma down a tad. The longer the beer sits the more the roasted malt comes through. The inital taste is the American hops: slightly piney, some grapefruit. The finish turns to the roasty malt and chewy sweetness much like a porter. The mouthfeel is medium with too much carbonation and too much alcohol warmth. I love the idea of this style but I haven't had one yet that I thought really brought everything together with the IPA hoppiness and roastly malt finish. I think this would be improved with English hops and a less attenuating yeast.","alexkeil","Mar 22, 2011"

Mike the brewmaster formerly of DFH Rehoboth location, knows how to combine the dark malts in the hops this version is really nice. Strong bitter dark chocolate with herbal/mint/citric/pine flavored hops going on, finishes nice and dry a very well meshed combination of different flavors. The best Otter Creek offering I've had in quite some time, I'm looking forward to trying their Kolsch this spring. Medium bodied smooth carbonation, I noticed a good amount of yeast sediment.

4.18,9.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This was nice and I think that Otter Creek really hit the nail on the head for this style, with the roast and sweetness taking the more aggressive edges off the hop profile and really melding this into a flavorful and mellow affair. Really well done new seasonal here that I will continue to come back to. Kudos to Otter Creek!","Kegatron","Dec 08, 2010"

Good lacing, taste is an unique blend of malts and hops. I expected the taste to be more on the hoppy side considering the aroma was full of pine/hops, but it is a smooth blend with the malty flavor. Nice lacing and mouthfeel is very silky and smooth. Delicious and unique beer. Definitely worth trying... one of the better brews from Otter Creek.","CaptDavyJones","Nov 24, 2010"
4.12,8.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer with great play between the malts and hops. It also seems appropriate as a winter release.","CHADMC3","Nov 21, 2010"
3.95,3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Black body with deep red edges when held up to the light. Off white two finger frothy fluffy head. This fades to a nice white cap, big and small bubbles. Smells of one or two American citrus hops, chinook and maybe Columbus but it's just a guess. Taste is quite complex. Citrus, clean hop bitterness, roasted malt, piney notes,'tobacco, leather, black tea. Quite bubbly and prickly going down. Very balanced even though it feels thin bodied. I'd definitely pick this up again. Give it a try.","Homebrew35","Nov 21, 2010"

4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Relatively light drinking, as are most Otter Creek beers. I like this quite a bit, and it's far easier to drink than a lot of other examples of black IPAs. Nothing to intense here, and not a crazy ABV.","musicforairports","Nov 20, 2010"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D: Out of the blue comes another American black IPA, this time from Otter Creek. Thankfully, it's well-balanced, smooth and tasty. At 6% ABV, this is a good, cold weather IPA with the hybrid, bitter malt roast to satisfy those searching for the warmth of their porters and stouts. Well executed and I'd grab it up again this season.","Gambrinus1184","Nov 19, 2010"
3.41,-10.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D- surprised by how much it seemed like an IPA other than appearance and finish. An enjoyable beer and I would buy more.","ChugsMugs","Nov 19, 2010"

4.71,23.6,3,4.5,5,4.5,5,"D - Again, my first endeavor into the black IPA world, small as it may be, and I am very impressed. Only have one bottle of this as a sample from my favorite beer store, but after this one I am thinking I should have just bought a sixer...","HomebrewNurse","Nov 15, 2010"

3.87,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"12oz bottle no visible Freshness Date. This is my first Black IPA and I'm not quite sure what I'm in store for. Pours a nice black color with a medium sized head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing. Nice piney hop aroma. Some mocha as well. The taste is a nice blend of mocha and the pine flavor of the hops. Not as big a hop flavor as indicated by the smell. Roasted malts flavors at the end. A good introduction into this style of beer. I'm hoping this shows up in one of their mix 12 packs. Might seek out a 6 pack of it on it's own though.","PicoPapa","Nov 11, 2010"
4.1,7.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a black color, not opaque by any means, a good sized brownish head sits atop. Hop forward nose, roasty malt takes a back seat. Big hop driven flavor, excellent balance. Medium bodied, well carbonated and very easy to drink. Otter Creek continues to impress with their new offerings.","ATPete","Nov 11, 2010"
4.23,11,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Melange of dark malt, orangy, and herbal aroma is nice but could use more hop aroma to move it into the IPA realm. Sweet up front with chocolate, prune, orange, and cattail like herbal flavor that yeilds to elongated piney hop flavor and some bitterness. Well crafted and way too easy to drink. Like a winter warmer but uses hops instead of spices - although I would like to see it tipped more to the IPA side with more hop aroma and flavor - I like it and will buy more.","Longstaff","Nov 10, 2010"
3.96,3.9,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Very surprised by this offering, coming out of the gate and being a seasonal, Otter Creek did a splendid job of blending together a perfectly flavorful IPA with the big malt properties that alot of us crave during the colder months. Black IPA's are getting pretty popular in the past year and OC nailed this one pretty nicely. At 6% ABV, this one is a fairly easy sipper and pretty interesting to keep around on a colder night. A great attempt at a style that will get more popular as the years go by.","thespaceman","Nov 03, 2010"

4.05,6.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is full and rich and creamy, very satisfying. Overall seems more IPA than black, but a very tasty and drinkable beer. Seems like most Cascadian Darks are big and robust, whereas this one is a more quaffable version.","far333","Oct 30, 2010"
3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"My overall impression with Otter Creek is mixed. Like other Vermont based breweries it's either hit or miss. This is a hit for sure. The flavor is complex but not so much so you can't hone in. The biggest compliment I can give is that you can have several servings in a sitting and it doesn't become too much, as is the case with a lot of ipa's. I am interested in trying out some more black ipa's to see how this compares but I was indeed pleasantly suprised!","jlpower","Oct 24, 2010"
