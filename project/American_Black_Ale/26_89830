While the citrus, pine-y notes are more faded in this bottle, it makes up for it with the rich, roasted delicious cocoa-barley flavor. Hope to have this fresh sometime again, because this was definitely enjoyable.","magictacosinus","Sep 18, 2013"

4.24,9.3,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma and flavoring. While many Black IPAs/ales tend to overdo it with the bitterness of roast and overly hoppy bite, this guy strikes a tender balance between the inherent sweetness of the roasty, chocolatey, porter-esque malt base, with the fruity, citric, and floral hoppy balance of your sweeter east-coast IPA. This makes for a pleasing, highly inviting beer on all accounts. The ingredients are full flavor and never really cheapen, giving richness and robustness throughout. This is one of the best, most balanced weâ€™ve had for the style in a long time, and it, again, truly speaks to the diversity of the brewery in drive, intensity, and execution.","TheBrewo","Jun 28, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a dark black-sienna topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises heavy leek, light roasted malts, and some light pine resin. The taste brings in more of the same, but luckily the roast o'erpowers the leek character, though not enough to rid the world of it entirely. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I guess this could've been a nice black IPA had it been brewed with different hops, but the leek here just ruins things for me.","TMoney2591","May 26, 2013"

4.05,4.4,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Pours a cola brown with tan head. Plenty of head retention, perhaps a bit lighter than some of the other black IPAs. The nose is heavy on citrus hops with notes of grapefruit and bright pineapple tones. If I were blindfolded, I would never be able to tell that this IPA is dark. The taste features the deeper malt profile that I expect in the style, but almost no roast is present. Fruity hops dominate with some resinous undertones and mellow bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat light with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, I don't know what the dark malts contribute to this beer, but it is tasty nonetheless.","homebrew311","May 11, 2013"
3.96,2.1,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"O - this beer is very similar to FFF Toxic Revolution Stout which I drank right before this. It's slightly more hoppy and less roasty/malty with a thinner body. I prefer Toxic Revolution to this by a small margin. This is very similar to Firestone Wookey Jack and the same style, but I prefer the taste of this and I swear I'm not a homer rater nor do I have a stiffy for FFF. Nice beer!","GuzzLah","May 10, 2013"

If I had to compare it to another Three Floyd's beer, it would be the Toxic Revolution. After pouring, I saw that it was dark brown in color with a burnt brown, thin head.

The carbonation is on point as is the viscosity. This would be a better bomber to share as I was done for the night after this one just because my mouth was on flavor overload. The alcohol is well hidden due to the all the battling flavors. I would seek this out to try. It's very different than many Black IPAs I've had. The roast is deeper, and the hop character is distinctly 3 Floyd's.","PHBoiler","Apr 11, 2013"
