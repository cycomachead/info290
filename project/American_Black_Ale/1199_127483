For all that is going on, I thought it was fairly drinkable. Founders has the right idea here, just needs a little more tweaking. Not many of this style are better, though.

The liquid is not quite opaque and up close you really see how clear it is, basic brown color, no bubbles to be seen except a few here and there near the surface, actually looks like a “tweener.” In the nose the roast comes through like a bell, coffee and mocha, behind that is caramel, butterscotch and coconut, at turns gets close to being peaty, mild apricot and cherry fruit scents, with all of that maltiness the burst of herbaceousness is a jolting reminder that technically it is an IPA. Medium-bodied, lacking in the carbonation department which saps some of the life which would truly make this a superlative beer. Dark chocolate, coffee beans, toasted coconut shake hands with pine sap, leafy matter, and white grapefruit zest. While bitter you easily adjust to it. Nothing about this is shy nor retiring, it is not an easy sipper. For as much zigging and zagging as you get, it still manages to hold it together.

The flavor has a pleasing, pungent bitterness up front and a tapered bitter-roast that lingers. More green grapefruit hop character and a bit of chocolate-coffee roast play nicely together. Enjoyed this one.","elNopalero","Feb 11, 2015"

4.31,6.7,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Pours a very dark brown (bordering on black until you shine a light into it) with ruby hints when held to the light,  producing 3+ fingers of frothy, moderately lasting, khaki head that leaves a collar ring & patches of chunky lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, earthy floral & a little pine, with roasted notes of chocolate intermingled with hints of anise, molasses & very faint coffee. Taste is grapefruit hoppy-roast fronted but by mid-sip is citrus, Hershey's chocolate syrup & semisweet chocolate with caramel, molasses & a little coffee, in the finish it transitions to more bitter pine dominant hops backed up by citrus, smoke, & burnt malts, becoming a hop bitter/burnt chocolate malt aftertaste. There is a plastic/phenolic presence briefly, but definitely on my palate, in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden in both the nose and mouth for an 8.9 ABV; very little warmth but some alcohol bitterness and perhaps spice in the mouth. There is dark wheat malt in this but I do not pick it up in either the nose or mouth. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, creamy & mildly chewy with a little prickle in the finish.

4.07,0.7,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Picked a single 12 oz. bottle out of a line up to-go at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC. Carefully poured at home in to a IPA glass, giving ample time to let the experience unfold. The beer is a translucent, chestnut brown during the pour, but black and foreboding when it collects in the glass. Completely opaque. Slow rising carbonation yields a single finger of beige foam. In time the foam dissolves leaving some oily hop residue on the surface. No lacing. A burnt caramel aroma mingles with some minty pine hops, underscored by freshly baked dark breads. Altogether, it yields a feigned impression of rye with some nice floral hops. A complex and inviting nose. The initial sip is dominated by tart citrus bitterness with thin cocoa in the background. There's faint smoke with an earthy, herbal flavor throughout.  The finish is relatively dry. The aftertaste is where this beer shines, with a dark chocolate citrus flavor reminiscent of an orange truffle. The mouthfeel is medium-full with soft prickly carbonation. Quite nice. The alcohol in this beer is incredibly well hidden. In fact, it wasn't until I sensed a small buzz that I checked the label. I was shocked to see 8.9% ABV. Of course that is not unreasonable in the world of double IPA's, but it never occurred to me that this one was in that league. That's a testament to the quality of this brew. I would have preferred a bit more sweetness and balance but there's little to complain about here.  What you'll find is a fine example of assertive hops with a little chocolate & roast to add complexity. Another solid Founders creation. Would you expect anything less?","JohnnyI","Jan 10, 2015"

At first the bitterness completely overpowers the rest of the beer, but, as I've found more and more with Founder's beers and I can't help but be redundant, the more you try it, it's almost as if it has such a perfect medley of flavors that you can choose the characteristics that you want from it, it can either be a bitter, crisp, hoppy pale ale or a smooth, malty sweet dark beer with beautiful undertones of pine and roasted chestnut. By meditation one can transcend the bitterness. A definite addition to my regular rotation of craft brews when it's available.","Hntr2045","Dec 07, 2014"

That's not to say that other black IPAs don't have the same roastiness and bittersweet chocolate characteristics, but they're a little bit fuller here. It seems to teeter, in fact, sometimes displaying more of the citrusy hops, and other times offering more of the toastiness, roastiness, nuttiness, deep caramel, and dark/bittersweet chocolate notes. Somehow the alcohol never really shows itself, although there are suggestions of it in the splash of dryness that hits you at the finish. But again, where this beer could have hit you with a long-lingering bitter and roasty finish, there's none of that... instead, it somehow manages to squeeze out a bit of sweetness that seems like a combination of very light creamy caramel and burnt (or nearly burnt) sugar. In that way Founders has done an excellent job in formulating an almost compellingly drinkable "Imperial Black India Pale Ale". Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 26, 2014"

Nice nose of blended hops (citrus, rind and pine) over a slight biscuit/caramel  sweetness with a spicy note. As it warms, alcohol and char notes are present.  Almost medium body with a bit of slick texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is a bit intense, yet well balanced with subtle complexities, for this hop forward ale.  It begins with pine and grapefruit rind hop flavors that slowly yield to a medium bitterness.  As the bitterness fades in the middle, caramel sweetness comes forward providing a well constructed balance.  As this fades, tropical hop notes, a bit of char and peppery spice notes come forward.  The finish is long and leaves you with a strong alcohol note and back of the throat burn. A sweet bitterness lingers.","tillmac62","Nov 24, 2014"

This stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of dark khaki foam.  Hm, you'd think darkness was a theme here...  The nose comprises pine resin, mixed greens, and light dry maple syrup.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of treacly roasted malts.  A good amount of bitterness pervades.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather drying finish.  Overall, though my opinion on the style has not changed, Founders has made a black IPA that I don't hate.  I'll likely not have another, but the balance between the bittering agents (the hops and the roast) assures that at least I won't be looking back at this beer in anger (so no worries, Gallagher Brothers...).","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2014"

With this one we found a hugely surprising degree of bittering char and leathery bite from the massive malt character.  Unlike your typical black IPA, however, we missed that overly sweetened hop profile to bring you into that beautiful blend that you look for.  With that said, this was a very simple beer.  To compare, last years “Inspired Artist” took on that fantastic balance, with fruitiness of hops big enough to meet the dark malt profile.  Here, with a presumably imperial version of that recipe, the char takes us to a whole new level of darkness that lets little escape beyond it.  We have been sitting on this one a couple weeks longer than most everyone else, but we don’t feel that the hops would fade much in that time to allow for such a presentation.","TheBrewo","Nov 15, 2014"

The aroma of citrusy hops is so fresh and bright, one might think some sort of witchcraft was involved in it's creation. Now, as for the flavor, the hops come through with more of a 'resinous' piny taste, finishing very dry and coarsely bitter, just as a devoted hop-head would desire. There's a touch of molasses, but not much roasted malt... In the case of this Black IPA, the malts sort of give the beer a backbone and they add mostly to full out the body and mouth feel. Overall, not what I typically expect to find in a Black IPA, but that's not a bad thing at all.","Neorebel","Nov 02, 2014"

The aroma was a lovely mix of citrus from the hops, a hefty dose of pine, and then some cherry from the dark malt.  The taste was very dry from the bitter hops, which tasted like pine and grapefruit, with some astringency from the roasted malt.  There was a hint of toffee and vanilla in the finish.  The body was quite thick for the style, and mouthfeel full of burnt malt astringency but with a soft texture.  This was much more of a sipper than most DIPA beers.","rajendra82","Nov 02, 2014"

It's why lighter in the roast than others, getting its dark died not so much from roasted barley, but from a dark wheat malt, less intense darkness, and nowhere near the bitterness double jeopardy that sometimes results. It still feels delicate despite being enormous, well bubbly and not real thick or heavy in body or texture. The hops are very obviously centennial focused, which works great with the grain, super hoppy this one, but not overdone. The alcohol is invisible in the drinking experience until the buzz is considered, which is substantial even after just a bit of this. Heady hops here. Super dank and jazzy, long finishing. One of the better black IPA types going right now, just lovely from the tap. A hint of pepper in the finish with the hops, so dynamic and well made.","StonedTrippin","Nov 01, 2014"

With as many flavors at play here, they're walking a veritable tightrope. The Dark Penance never feels cobbled together, but somehow feels as though heavy citrus hops and dark bitter malts were meant to be together - something that I rarely feel with other beers in the style.

Then a long dry hop bitter finish.  Did I say bitter yet?

Light tan head. Stringy lacing. Aroma is interesting. Huge grapefruit presence. The dark malts are also important. I get subtle whiffs of smoke and anise. Heavily hoppy but still dependent upon its rich dark maltiness. The bitterness crashes upon the tongue. The hops are piney and coercive. They don't have much flavor depth; mostly just pure buttering effect. The sweetness brings forth more complexity. Rock candy, brown sugar, roast. Finishes with some wheat character. This beer is beyond bitter. Aspirin-like bitterness. I can't recall a more bitter beer in recent memory. Body isn't overly heavy; I was expecting more and I am actually happy with its forgiving heftiness. If there is any alcohol in the flavor it's hidden behind he fact that my tongue is absolutely blown out by the bitterness. Well carbonated. Well made, caustic bitterness, has its intricacies. May take a while to get through this 4 pack. The combo of roast and nearly toxic bitterness has me down on this beer. Probably a brew I would have liked more early on in my craft beer voyage.","VelvetExtract","Oct 18, 2014"

You need to be a hop lover for this beer to begin with, and then you will still do some penance for drinking the beer.  It's a strangely pleasurable pain with the hop bitterness.  I like bitterness and it comes through in this beer in spades.  The alcohol is dangerously well hidden; I did not detect it or start to feel it until the end of the 1st glass.  And since I was staying for awhile and having a pizza as well, a second one was a welcome event, even though it dealt out additional penance to my tongue.  A very good beer and I'm glad I had two over a long meal with friends.  Good to look at and strong in flavor.  I've done my penance and don't mind.","damndirtyape","Oct 17, 2014"

Black IPAs are something I have really been into lately and Founders makes great brews.  This one didn't have the "spicy" taste I expect on a Black IPA.  After it warmed the bitterness faded - but so did the chocolate and dark fruits.  I won't buy another - there are Black IPAs that are cheaper and I enjoy much more","fscottkey","Oct 15, 2014"

Leaves a good layer of lace around the glass after each sip.  Smells fantastic.  Hint of alcohol, a bit of citrus from the hops, and a slight aroma similar to a RIS.  The bitterness is perfect and well balanced by its hop character.  Very pleasant with a slight smokey flavor as it goes down.  This is right up there with Surly Blakkr, which I love.  Seriously considering letting it in my top 10 brews list...  A very good beer.  I recommend trying it for anyone who likes hops, bitterness, stouts, and medium to full-bodied beers.  Founders does a fine job yet again.","BeerSnobRobinson","0"

The head is small and sticky, leaving nice clusters of lace on the glass.  Aroma is chocolaty, developing a fruity greenness as it warms.  Instantly chocolaty in the mouth and surprisingly light on the hops.  I was expecting bold, spicy pine and floral/citrus battling it out with the malt, but what I got was lots of cocoa and a mild leafy citrus presence. Every one of the 100 IBU seems to be in full effect however, giving some edge to an otherwise creamy, medium-plus body.  Despite the lack of hops, I actually enjoyed this as more of a bitter chocolaty malty beer.  Easy drinking for its strength too.  I think I’ll need to try one from the bottle to see how it compares.","wedge","Oct 14, 2014"

Black IPAs are not my favorite style, and this one lacks the complexity of Stone's SSRA (or that 15th Anniversary beer Stone made that was simply divine - anyone else remember that one?). Nevertheless, I really like the balance between roast and hops that Founders has struck here. It's like the Roast Party holds 58 Senate seats, the Hops Party holds 36, and the Malt Party holds the other 6. However, as we all know, these parties somehow work together just fine.","deadonhisfeet","Oct 13, 2014"

It tastes like citrusy (citrus peel, grapefruit) and pine hops, roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and some earthiness.  Nice bitter finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.  It's also easy enough and enjoyable to drink.  Overall I liked this, but for whatever reason I expected it to be better.  Maybe I just expect more out of Founders than I do most other breweries.  And at $13.99 a 4-pack, to me it seems pricey.

Smell from the glass has more herbal notes like mint and tea leaf mixed with the roasted/burnt malt and rich coffee notes. The charred grains and hoppy sweetness make for a wonderful smelling nose. Tastes great, and certainly not less filling; the chocolate, burnt malt, coffee and smoky bitterness merge and balance quite well with the bitter piney hop and grapefruit flavors. The alcohol is caught up in the cyclone of flavors and has no bearing on the overall appeal of this brew, which has a kick that sneaks up on you. I’ve had several of these over the past 2 weeks and this is another great beer from Founders that I highly recommend. It's another great Black IPA that was released this year and worthy of mention within the class of Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale.","CHickman","Oct 11, 2014"

Aroma of bitter pine, some grapefruit, almost a spicy rye character. Flavor is very chocolatey and smooth sweetness balanced by a huge hit of bitter pine, super dry, spicy roasty notes. Beautifully silky body, medium plus carbonation, dry finish. This exceeded my expectations. Very nice.","BMMillsy","Oct 10, 2014"

4.25,5.2,,,,,,"Poured a rich black body with brown highlights on the edge of the glass and a thin film of tan off-white head. Very nice looking and true to form for a dark ale. Scents of grapefruit, grapefruit peel, orange peel and flesh, and tropical fruit, light notes of pine resin, very light notes of chocolate and roast malt in the background. Overall impression of aroma is of a nice, hop-forward black ale with just enough depth from the malt coming through. Very nice and quite appealing. Flavor begins hoppy, with notes of grapefruit peel and pith, orange zest, light tropical fruit, moderate-light pine resin and hints of roasted malt. Middle opens up to be more bitter with strong notes of grapefruit and pomelo peel and pith, more abundant pine resin and medium levels of roast malt. Finish is dry with strong notes of grapefruit and pomelo peel and pith, pine resin, orange zest and medium-strong levels of roast malt with light alcohol in the background. Aftertaste is roast malt bitter pine resin and grapefruit peel and pith. Overall impression of flavor is of an excellent dark ale that is wonderfully hoppy, but still has a very good roast malt presence. Nice and drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-light carbonation and a resinous feel upfront with a slick finish. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice dark ale that is true to form, very similar to other hoppy beers. Easy drinking despite the body and quite pleasant. Overall this is a fantastic dark ale. Like many others it leans towards hops, but the overall profile is so well done that it compares quite well to Mountain Standard and Wookey Jack. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Oct 09, 2014"

Aromas of resinous pitch, bitter hops, sweet citrus, wood and pepper spice, and a hint of roast and smoke in the backbone. Very hop heavy nose. Flavors are extremely resinous and heavy grapefruit forward, providing an absolute blast of tart and bitter on the palate. Wow! Solid roast backbone, with some hints of coffee and chocolate, but it's all about the resin, grapefruit, pine, citrus, and bitterness in this one. Hopheads rejoice! The body is soft, mid-range, but supports the palate perfectly. Very bitter, citrus heavy aftertaste, with lingering resinous notes. The finish is smooth, slightly dry, and light, and the drying bitterness lingers on for a bit. This is a beast. A fun hopped exercise for your palate.","GarthDanielson","Oct 09, 2014"

Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, light coffee, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and light-moderate roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, and floral/roasted earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of big citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/roasted malt sweetness; with a nice crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/roasted malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 07, 2014"

4.39,8.7,4.75,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,"O - A really great take on a black IPA. Definitely the most bitter of the style I've tried, but still manages to balance the roast and hops quite well. A good effort from founders. It reminds me a bit of my favorite black ale; Stone's SSR. I'll have to do a side by side sometime in the near future!","DemoniChris","Sep 29, 2014"
4.25,5.2,,,,,,"Founders really did a fantastic job with Dark Penance. It may not be perfect but it may just set a new standard that I will use in evaluating American black ales henseforth. I'm glad this is year-round because I'll be enjoying this a great deal.","ThickNStout","Sep 28, 2014"

4.2,4,,,,,,"With the long bitterness and roastiness extending long in aftertaste, the ale remains remarkably hoppy and bitter; offering a sane closure of sweetness and creaminess in body. There's moments when a hoppy and full-bodied porter is tasted and felt, however its hop-forward flavor reigns supreme and keeps the beer both American and imperial.","BEERchitect","Sep 27, 2014"

Will definitely be picking up more. I'm interested to find out what this will taste like at 6 to 8 weeks though as dark roasts of any sort tend to overtake hops quickly I have found.","PaulyB83","Beers"
