4.54,7.3,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"A fabulous beer and an interesting take on the so-called black IPA. This is as dark as a porter or stout. The nose is a bit of roasted coffee and chocolate, with a hint of pine. The taste is the same. This is a much maltier black IPA than others, but there's still a piney quality that marks as an IPA. Mouthfeel is medium with some creaminess. Very smooth. Quite different from others of its kind like Sublimely Self-Righteous but a great beer.","Qbdoo","Jun 18, 2014"

It's a good beer, and the strong hoppy taste (you get a LOT on the nose) blends well with the smoky malt, but at $18.99 a 4-pack, it's just too expensive. I purchased once because I was curious (it's gotten good reviews and I love both FFF and Surly), but I can't see myself dropping another $20 on a 4-pack of this. For fans of black IPAs, I'd assume this'll be a real hit, though.","SeanBond","Jun 01, 2014"

Flavor is more straight forward IPA like with piles of pine and citrus bitterness, very light dark chocolate and a bitter pine and mild ash finish. Medium thick, high carbonation, chewy finish.","yourefragile","Apr 27, 2014"

3.05,-27.9,3,3,3,3.5,3,"OVERALL: A good hop bomb for sure, but it's all IPA. There was really no need to make this beer dark brown, as any kind of roasted or chocolate flavors that would be produced by these dark grains were not allowed to come out and play anyways. The trick with a hoppy black ale is to hop it up, but show just the right amount of restraint so the character of the dark grains can play a role in the flavor profile as well. That didn't happen here. Might as well just make a regular hop bomb DPA and call it Ornggr. A good beer that we enjoyed, but not representative of the style.","Jeffo","Apr 25, 2014"

Light wisps of citrus, hints of espresso and roast, touches of burnt chocolate malt, and perhaps even a bit of toffee on the nose. Opens with light caramel notes and light cocoa powder. Tropical fruit accents join in including pineapple and mango. Caramel and toffee accented maltiness is joined by bold passionfruit. Transitions into bitter citrus rind which give way to espresso-tinged bitterness and clean alcohol. Well carbonated, lighter to average medium body that is smooth with a touch of creaminess here and there. One of the better brews in the style. Having enjoyed Three Floyds version previously, I actually prefer Surly's version just a bit more.","chanokokoro","Mar 06, 2014"

Love the complexity and long, steady finish that dissipates into a wine-like dry-roast acidity. The aftertaste is the lingering aftermath of a rich brunch washed down by the last sip of orange juice (mixed 50/50 with Cava?). Blakkr is the best Black IPA I've tasted to the date of this review. I feel bettr about the future of this hybrid category after having drank this beer.","dwabell","Mar 04, 2014"

Delicious beer, black malts and all and with a 10% ABV it packs a pleasant punch.. I don't believe I've ever tried anything from Real Ale, but with plenty of experience of the other two breweries I get a sense of the 3 Floyds and Surly DNA in every sip. And now the glass is empty..time for another.
