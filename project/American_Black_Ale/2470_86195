I'm a bit of a sucker for "cascadian ales," or black IPAs, or whatever you want to call them; I find the combination of smoky roasted notes with an often citric hop bite to be wonderful. Brew Kettle nails both aspects here. Ample Citra hopping delivers a winning burst of tropical fruit and citrus, before giving way to an almost mocha-like smokiness. This is delicious. A muted nose is the only subpar part of the beer. The body and feel are on point too, creamy and just aggressive enough. Tasty, dry finish. Love this.","markgugs","Feb 15, 2015"

Probably the best Iâ€™ve had of this style, although I must admit, I still find this style a little perplexing. The mix of hops and roast is still not my thing. Having said this, this one is pretty good. Fans of this style take this review with a grain of salt.","2beerdogs","Jan 23, 2015"

Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate roasted malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, chocolate, cocoa, toast, light char, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon/orange zest, pine, chocolate, cocoa, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate roasted malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate roasted malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 10, 2014"

4.04,-2.9,,,,,,"Side by side comparison with white rajah. Aroma is skunky and citrusy with tropical notes even in the bottle. Resin, grapefruit, mango, mango, and pineapple are contrasted by roasty chocolatey malt. The hop aroma profile is damn near dead-on between the two. Flavor reveals similar citrus notes, along with biting resin and an underlying malt sweetness, with a slightly more bitter finish, due to lingering roast malt. I like the perception of sweetness the chocolate notes in the malt provide, but the char pushes the bitterness too far out for me. Think I'll stick with the original, but still a great beer.","barczar","Dec 02, 2014"

Unlike offerings from, say, 21st Amendment (Back in Black IPA), there is no caramel malt sweetness to counterpoint the hops.  The dark roasted malt is additional bitterness rather than a contrast.  That said, the flavor is clean, and this is pretty drinkable if you're looking for a fairly assertive IPA.  I would have rated this higher as an amber IPA, which is basically what it tastes like.","HeightsEats","Nov 26, 2014"

4.02,-3.4,4.25,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, no bottle date.  Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours very dark brown with a couple inch frothy light tan head.  The head stayed around a long time, and there's also a lot of lacing.  The brew smells like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, grapefruit), pine hops, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt.  Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also some grassiness and coffee noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and coating with a good amount of carbonation.  I thought this was a good brew, definitely worth a try if you come across some.  $11.99 a 6-pack.","bluejacket74","Oct 10, 2014"

So maybe it just appears light. the tropical fruit shines through. I suppose it has more IPA than 'Black' to me. Still a very well rounded easy drinking beer~","BrewUSA","Oct 03, 2014"

4.04,-2.9,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Served on tap (and enjoyed in a growler) from Spinoza's in Beavercreek, Ohio. This poured a very dark brown with a two inch head that left splotchy lacing. The smell is malty and hoppy, with roasted malt and toffee but there's not much that stands out (while White Rajah has an amazing smell that rivals the best IPAs). The taste consists of a 40/40 balance between chocolate and pine from the hops with caramel and coffee rounding things out. As for the mouthfeel, this is fairly smooth and minimally carbonated with bitterness that seems to come more from the coffee than the hops and that is moderately thick. Overall, I'm not a big fan of black IPAs, and so I expected to enjoy this less than White Rajah. Still, I think there's some room for improvement here. This is more difficult to find than the White, probably because (I believe) this is only available on tap and tends to go quick.","DeFaz","Apr 12, 2014"
