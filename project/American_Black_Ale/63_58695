4.17,1.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Bomber poured into a shaker pint glass. Extremely dark brown opaque brew with a frothy, creamy sponge toffee-like head three fingers high. Rich aroma of dark chocolate/cacao powder, white grapes, pine needles, grapefruit rind, this morning's coffee left out on the counter top all day, guava, warm orange juice, gummy worms ... This could be one of the best Cascadian darks/black IPAs I've yet to sample with the possible exception of the slightly more tropical Lagunitas Night Time. The balance between dark roast and fruity, spicy hops is nigh perfect, no mean feat even for some pretty reputable craft brewers. An initial flood of burnt chocolate pudding, raisins, and wood char is quickly supplanted (or perhaps complemented is the better word) by grapefruit, orange, mango, grape, and lime, without any appreciable flavor clash or other unpleasantness. Somehow starts roasted and dry while finishing sweet and fruity, with a pine note lurking throughout. Gets spicier and more resinous over time but clean and without any harshness. Just enough green flavor. Medium heavy body with ample chew and nice middle of the road carbonation. This changes my general level of enthusiasm for this style from lukewarm but open-minded to keen on further exploration. Gotta love these paradigm shifts that occasionally strike the ticker like lightning.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 05, 2015"

Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/roasted malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, chocolate, cocoa, roast, toast, light coffee, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/roasted malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Black IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

Nose is a nice combination of pine and malt, some coffee and chocolate hidden in there as well. Balanced taste of the malt and hops, you get the hops initially with a malt backbone. Bitterness hits the tongue first and the sweetness flushes in before ending with hops again, dry finish. Mouthfeel is moderate and right in the middle, not too light and not too heavy. Well-balanced and nice carbonation, which makes it easy to drink. Overall, a solid black IPA. I like stouts and IPAs separately, not a huge fan of this style, but Deschutes makes this well.","fannypakit","Jun 24, 2014"

3.84,-6.6,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,"Overall, this is more of a “serious” take on your black ale. Where many black ales will meet the dark smokiness of the malts, and any bitterness of the hops, with a sugary sweetness of inclusions, or more commonly of a secondary fruity hoppiness, here you get the unabashed raw side. While we prefer our black ales to have more of that sweeter balance, this brew works well with the chord it has struck. We do lose a fair amount of pointage on the nose, which comes across dull, and dry. Warmth does help it along a bit, as it does with the thick creaminess of the feel, but it doesn’t quite eradicate those initial misgivings. This is a very nice black ale (C.D.A. if you will), but we don’t feel it entirely and adequately represents the bulk of what you should expect from the style.","TheBrewo","Jun 12, 2014"

There isnt as much roast as I would prefer but it is still very good. The mouthfeel medium to full body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer.","WoodBrew","Dec 22, 2012"

I've had this style a few times (Cascadian Dark Ale is apparently the name they're pushing for black IPA, I love it) and this is a prototype for the group. Not as stunning as Mountain Standard was to me the first time, but as solid as Deschutes always does.","AllHailBeercules","Sep 01, 2012"

The head is thick , dark tan and very soft, bubby and looks just like heaven should. I got a two finger thick head and it just won’t leave your side! It’s got a rather thin aroma, some roasted malts, mild dark fruits, very sweet overall, raisins, figs and prunes all come through. Pouring more into it, the beer cuts right through the head like an all too tight pair of jeans on an all to fat ass…it leave an mark to say the least. Its rather light and crisp on the tip of your tongue, and rather light bodied, but as it travels towards the back of your mouth it feels more like a medium bodied beer and then slightly heavier as it hits the back of your throat. The roasted malts re strong, the fig and raisin come through pretty well too. Its slightly bitter overall and the hops are well hidden until you get to the aftertaste…then it sort of kicks you in the tongue. Overall I really like this beer, I would categorize this beer's badassedness right up there with a Remington 870 Police Magnum with a 14 inch barrel.

Pine, grapefruit and a little bit of orange are all noticeable in the hop bitterness. The grainy bitterness does mask some of the hop flavor, and the light unsweetened cocoa character does enhance the sense that this really is a hoppy porter. The mid-palate is just a touch watery. Light in body with a moderate, creamy carbonation, this beer finishes with an aggressive pine bitterness, a little bit of roast and some citrus. Excellent stuff, this.","DefenCorps","Jun 22, 2012"

A sharp earthiness/pineness alongside a touch of some citric rind starts things off supported by some coffee and chocolate and even some bread. Smell dulls out a little as it warms. Flavor offers some chocolate, coffee, pepper, pine with a mild to moderate bitterness developing throughout the sip and climaxing in the finish. A nice creamy and silky active mouthfeel. Overall, Deschutes made me enjoy a black ale, though still not a style I find myself too fond of. Most Black IPA's that I have tried seem to have a strong infusion of citric fruit which this one doesn't, something that I think helped me enjoy this one more than others. Probably not a beer I will rush to have again, but still one I am glad to have tried and have enjoyed trying.","denver10","Jun 10, 2012"

Some floral essence as the olfactory becomes more involved in the taste. Lastly, a little smokiness that the hop bitterness tends to perpetuate. I've never been remarkably impressed with this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's better than average, but by Deschuttes standards, it is nothing about which to get too excited. Especially for the price.","DocJitsu","Apr 25, 2012"

Earthy, roasty, slightly subdued nose with hints of citrus, dark chocolate, coffee, and just a touch of pine and nuts. The taste is noticeably more bold with a nice roasted malt profile up front, meshing nicely with a tangy, fresh hop bitterness on the finish. Lots of dark chocolate and espresso, and as it warms, the citrus comes alive with a touch of pine as well. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and a bit oily, with a really bitter finish. Most of the Black IPA's I've had are more of a stout/IPA cross, where this was more of a porter/IPA. Definitely a unique interpretation of the style, and one that I will revisit. A solid offering from Deschutes.","beerdrifter","Jan 08, 2012"

4,-2.7,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Better than most in the style but not as enjoyable as the imperial version, the Deschutes Hop in the Dark CDA is a good sipper. I find that the drinkability is better than most American Black Ales, and that the beer becomes more drinkable as it warms.

Thick as hell, with nice sticky lacing. Smell was hoppy upfront but you could tell there was some nice dark malt behind it. This might be my new favorite style. I love me some hops but the addition of good amounts of dark malt is something wonderful. It's like a stout and IPA combined.

3.95,-3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O: This is what I think of when I want an American black ale. Little roasted quality with a hop character that works well with the roasted malt and chocolate/coffee flavors.

Solid bitterness from the hops as well as the dark malts with a sturdy malt backbone that was semisweet, notes of dark chocolate and roast, caramel, citrus and a hint of pine. It finished with some lingering malt sweetness and lemony citrus. Medium bodied with average carbonation level, a bit of dark grain astringency, relatively creamy texture.

5,21.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Even as the very first of many Cascadian Dark Ales that I would try, this beer struck me as special the first time I tasted it. it ventures into a degree of variety of dark malt flavors and roastiness that hardly have been conceived, or at least demonstrated in any other beer of this style. So many others are clearly afraid of their attempt resulting in a hoppy stout or porter, limiting the variety of dark malts to those that are only meant to affect color. This beer has set a standard for the style that outght not to be taken lightly. The progression of lingering hop flavors and terminal bitterness is nothing short of complimentary brilliance to the initial silky smooth and dark malt character.","amanofbeer","Aug 05, 2011"
3.88,-5.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Beautifully served to me in a tulip glass. Black body with a creamy tan head. Lets very little to no light through. Lots of malts and lots of hops is how this beer could be easily described. It has a great taste, very malty with an element that tasted just like a "malt" (like Guinness' non-alcoholic "Malta" or similar drinks). The malty feel is very sticky as well and leaves a unique and possibly overwhelming residual on your tongue as this is also a very hoppy beer. It's something to get used to, however, I don't know if I would. I didn't find it to be very drinkable for this reason. This beer is one to remember and may fit a incredibly unique niche of my personal beer taste, but not something that I would continually drink. For that reason, it is simultaneously mediocre but great.","mjw06","Aug 04, 2011"

Fantastic depth of flavor, a cuisine of a dark hoppy beer. I love how the hops are treated as an unusual flavoring ingredient. There's no citrus, there's no tropical fruit, there is just an accentuated roasting that really reinforce veggie bbq notes. I love this, I'd drink another one immediately if I had it. This would pair so amazingly with so many dishes, I say just improvise. Dark earthy salads, and mushroom burgers would make for a memorable pairing.

The aftertaste is a little sour and unexpected (not in a good way). Overall it’s a nice beer, but I didn’t get knocked off my feet as I expected I would.

Mostly citrus hop flavors up front with dark rosted malt flavors beneath. Roasty malt flavors slowly intensify in the middle, taking over the flavor profile and ushering in a roasted coffee flavor that carries to the end.

Only as it warms does the roasted edge come through. The flavor is much more porter-like, with the dark roasted chocolate malt, toast, a little smoke, and cherry, but still with the sparkly hops. It's a little hard to tune into what sort of hops you're experiencing, but their presence is clear.

Nice medium body with a smooth and mellow carbonation and a lightness to it that again was outside what I was expecting. Smooth flavor, clean, crisp, loaded with bitter citrus hops.

Goes well with a hint of pine and resin that are fairly refreshing. Shortly thereafter becomes bitter with higher apparent carbonation. Rich, dark espresso bean with heavily caramelized notes. Right on the edge of burnt but not quite there. Fairly dry from the middle through the finish and it dries out fast with over the top resiny/oily grapefruit and pine as a second, pleasantly bitter wave crashing into the mix. The grapefruit plays off the coffee nicely. Brown sugar, which starts out fairly subtle, becomes full blown but doesn't add much, if any, sweetness. Finish is only faintly bitter but oily and resiny with grapeskin, rather than roasty, bitterness which heavily coats the tongue and a hint of spice at the edge.","4000qtrap","Apr 30, 2011"

The nose is predominantly the now-customary west coast grapefruit hop aroma, but with tantalizing notes of apricot and a bit of ale yeast funk. The flavor, too will be familiar to IPA drinkers- hop forward, of course, but with notes of mocha as well. Mouth feel is light- surprisingly light considering how dark this stuff is, with a long, dry hoppy, grapefruit rind finish. A decent enough IPA, but the puzzling dark color isn't enough to break it out of the pack- I really want to see a little more malt here...","shadow1961","Jan 28, 2011"

The flavor is a bit complex, so bear with me. I'm getting a lot of different flavors, well blended, that attack the tastebuds. Bits of hops on a slightly sour malt backbone, with characteristics of molasses, bubble gum, and roasted coffee. It is full in mouth, but still remains light and crisp. The finish smooth and a little dry, and there is a bitter and hint of coffee aftertaste. The beer is extremely drinkable, and with the low ABV it is an easy going brew for the evening.

Pleasing spicy citric hop nose cradled by a solid malt base. Smoothness digs deep. Well-rounded malt character provides a good, balanced wall for the hops to play off of; an inkling of alcohol is clean.

There is the grapefruit kick on the front followed by some coffee/roasty characteristics on the swallow and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The two come together nicely. Chewy mouthfeel. I was expecting a lot from this beer based on the brewery and the sweet label. It did not disappoint.

4.02,-2.2,4,4.5,4,3,4,"D: This beer represents a good effort on the part of Deschutes to marry dark and hoppy qualities in one drinkable package. If anything, better balance could be achieved by adding emphasis to the hop bill--while certainly detectable, the aromatic hops seem one-note and not particularly characterful. The up side to this restrained hoppiness is that Hop in the Dark pairs wonderfully with savory food (such as the smoked sausage sandwich at Beachwood BBQ, on one outing). While the lion's share of recent dark IPA hybrids seem overdone, here Deschutes could give it another 10% and still be close to the mean (if that was indeed their goal).","beagle75","Sep 11, 2010"

The nose comprises pine, maple syrup, milk chocolate, and caramel. The taste mostly eschews the darker elements in favor of the pine, but a firm amount of the caramel makes it through as well. It's almost as though this was only an IPA in a porter's clothing... This isn't to say it's bad, just not what was expected from the smell. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a solid IPA, but I was kinda hoping the darker notes would persist on the tongue.

Like most things I enjoy, there was an interesting interplay, in this case between the sweetness of the malt (chocolate and toasted grain) and the great hop prescence - tropical fruits, bitterness, etc. There were some spice notes as well.

Very chocolaty and roasty flavors with very assertive hop flavors as well. I can honestly say I have never had a beer where flavors from opposite ends of the spectrum are so prominent but so well balanced at the same time. Mouthfeel was where this kind of fell short for me.

The hops are aggressive, yet they are still very well integrated into the large malt profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one fine beer. I'm usually not a fan a beers that try to be both malty and hoppy at the same time as they usually turn out to be a complete mess.

Citrus with spicy hops up front, with a hint of roasted malt. The malt comes out more with the finish. Medium-bodied and relatively smooth.

3.95,-3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I'm not entirely on board the CDA train, yet, but I still think this is a pretty good beer. As for the style, this seems like a strong, hoppy porter to me. There's some chocolate and caramel, but it's mostly the tangy, ashy roast flavor that I associate with porters. Hops are medium to strong for a 6.5% abv IPA and show up more in the flavor than aroma. The aroma is actually a bit milder than I expected. On the other hand, the beer is chock full of flavor. It's quite bitter with spicy pine resin and pungent grapefruit rind. The roasted malt adds further bitterness or, at least, accentuates the hops. Both taste and aroma are balanced between strong malt and hop flavors. The mouthfeel is a tad rough. I could see this beer and CDAs, generally, growing on me, but I'm not quite there yet. Still, it's a good beer, and I'll come back to it, one day.","popery","Jun 24, 2010"
4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a light black color. When held up to the light you can see a rusty/amber-brown color in the beer. Has a beautiful 1 1/2 inch tan head on this bad boy. This beer has a very interesting smell for an IPA. This is not my first "black ipa," but this one stands out a bit. You can smell a bit of "roastiness" to it along with a mild hop profile. I want to say that I'm also getting hints of dark fruit and coffee. Very interesting. Wow, the taste is extremely unique. I must have been right about the coffee smell because it totally comes out on my palate, especially in the aftertaste. The unique thing about this beer is that you get the hops right up front rather than after the usual citrus fruits. This beer has a strong coffee/espresso backbone. I'm really enjoying this. You also get hit with some nice grapefruit notes that seem to be enhanced by the bitterness of the coffee. This one has a very light mouthfeel for what I'm tasting on my palate. Drinkability is fairly high. This a great version of a black ipa. Very uniquely set apart from Sublimely Self-Ritious and Bashah IMO.","DovaliHops","Jun 24, 2010"
4.68,13.9,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This beer totally shocked me. I didn't expect much for some reason, although I love Deschutes. I guess I couldn't picture a black IPA. The appearance was as dark brown or nearly black. Nice thick foamy head which laced down the glass. The smell was of coffee and great maltiness and a little hops, but not much. The taste is just unbelievable. It's almost like a light porter with a real bitter finish. And it sits light in my stomach. It's not heavy. I've had nothing like it and I can't get enough. It's so smooth, too. I drank a bomber and could keep going. I've got another bomber in the fridge, but I'm going to hang onto it....for a day...maybe.","TomBrewnansky","Jun 23, 2010"

The flavor follows suit, with roasted malts and bold, piney hops. Moderately sweet, with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and dry, due in part to the bittering hops.

It's got a lot of flavor with not many spice notes which is cool.

4.35,5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: The incredible amount of roasted presence in the flavor is very surprising when you nearly can't find it at all in the aroma. This is definitely a hop forward ale both in aroma and bitterness, but there is room left for the "dark" portion of this emerging style to show a presence. Sweet chocolate aromatics are a pleasing blend to the citrus hop in the nose. Roasted dryness is pushing the palate to be overly stimulated and causes a great deal of drying.","DanOLeary","Jun 17, 2010"

This beer is great combination of roasted malts and intense hops. Pours an extremely dark chocolate brown with a slight bit a maroon showing up on the edges with a thin light tan head. The aromas scream IPA with intense citrus notes like grapefruit and fresh sliced oranges. You do pick up slight notes of roasted malts on the nose but it is tough to get through all the citrus. At first sip I really noticed the hops but as time progressed and the beer warmed the sweet and toasty flavors grain began to come through and actually becomes extremely well balanced. Overall this is a great beer for IPA lovers or anybody that wants to try something new.","WhatsNewinBooze","Jun 12, 2010"

Smell is of dark malt, piney hops, and almost a vanilla cream sort of smell to it. Very nice. Taste was superb I thought. Very rich and dark. At first you get the dark malt, almost a light taste of coffee and chocolate. Next you get the sprucey/piney hops with a bit of a grapefruit aftertaste. Very complex. The mouth feel was good, perhaps slightly light but overall fine. Very smooth and velvety with an oily aftertaste.

I may revisit this one again in the future to see if my opinion changes.","brewdoc75","Jun 08, 2010"
4.15,1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a near black, letting some light through, foamy cap of off-white head that doesnt linger long. Scent is of muted citrus, tropical and piney hops with a slightly brown sugar sweet malt backbone. Taste is a little more aggressive, a well blended concoction of the fruity hop notes and lightly roasted and freshly dried grains, neither overpowers the other. Lighter side of medium bodied, moderate carbonation, very little lingering aftertaste, slightly dry. A decent offering, well blended ingredients.","rfgetz","Jun 08, 2010"

Nice aromas of roasted malt, along with piney hops, bubblegum and citrus. The aromas translate well to the palate, with a good roasted malt background, complemented nicely by the piney/citrusy hops.
