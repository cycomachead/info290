4.08,0.7,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"Pours a dark brown that is close to black and has a massive offwhite head that dies slow and leaves lace patches down glass. A strong bit of citric hops are in the aroma along with hints of rye and roasted malts. Roasted malts and rye are prevalent and the wheat gives the beer both a fuller body and smoothness that is second to none. There are hints of sweetness (chocolate or caramel is my guess) as well as a good amount of citric hops on the backend. Well balanced beer and one of the few "black IPAs" that is able to draw out all the characteristics of both styles.","clayrock81","Aug 05, 2014"
4.21,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, spicy rye, cocoa, and slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt, rye, citrus zest, and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great balance of roast, citrus zest, and rye aspects all around.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 04, 2014"

4.01,-1,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Be careful with the pour or it will fill half the glass, otherwise it’s a few fingers of light tan, very uniform microfoam, looks like it was intentionally whipped up, very good retention, the lacing is pretty much a solid sheet down the glass side, rarely breaks into streaks. The liquid is a kind of muddy brown like pond water, semi-opaque, displays a yellow cast near the surface, through it all you can easily see the hyperactive bubbles bursting upwards. The nose is all but totally grapefruit citrus, the rye is consistent but not showy, well cooked country bread notes, light pepper spice, same for the nectarine to peach fruit scents, very smooth and focused, all about that citrus. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and the carbonation really gets it churning, overaggressive. When it does settle into the palate, the grapefruit leads again however the raw graininess is assertive. Some cocoa, the roast is not high-toned, more baked, bready. Pine adds to overall bitterness rather than sweetness, the fruit also tart, a mix of pineapple, nectarine and apple more than peach or apricot. Not trying to hard, that said, the finish while clean could use more flavor, quibbling. Hard not to consume happily.","farrago","May 13, 2014"

I know my bottle was probably beyond its prime by a few months, but the hops are still up front and provide a nice citrus-peel bite that offsets the barley and wheat flavors. It lacks the cocoa that many black ales rely on, and instead, relies on rye spice and roasted barley, which mostly works, but this beer gets a bit grainy at times. A solid effort in an increasingly crowded style.","spoony","Nov 29, 2013"

Flavor is similarly C-hop forward, with a little bit of roasted malt, and just a hint of rye grainy goodness on the back of the palate. Flavors are good but not all that complex -- a little disappointing given black rye IPA/CDAs have so much to offer. Still a really good beer...but 10 out of 10 times I'd rather have a Wookey Jack :) Carbonation is a little bit too strong. Bonus points for the massive head though.","hreb","Nov 16, 2013"

4.12,1.7,4.25,4,4,5,4,"The cork pops loudly as it's removed. A near-black colored ale is revealed with a towering, beige head that holds excellent retention, that leaves tons of lacing as it eventually fades. Aromas are earthy, spicy rye malt, roasted barley, dank piny hops, grapefruity citrus comes through more as it warms. Bold notes of spicy rye, roasted barley, sweet caramel, and earthy, dank, bitter, piny hops battle on the palate, creating a nice meld of flavors with excellent complexity and balance. Mouth-feel is exceptionally smooth and creamy, while being full bodied. Overall, I really enjoyed this, but in my opinion it falls short in comparison to another beer similar to this one (FWWJ).","barnzy78","Apr 12, 2013"

4.23,4.4,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Served in a tulip at The Saucer on 4/3/13. Pours a deep, light devouring black into the glass with not many other hues to it. It has a good tannish head with tons of tiny bubbles that leaves good, sticky, thick lacing all over the glass. The smell was full of powerful hops. There was tons of oily, resinous citrus on the nose, which I absolutely love, but I felt like the malt was a little overpowered. I pick up a bit of roasted coffee and maybe some charred cookie in the background, but it is totally eaten alive by the hops. As I taste the beer it starts with the bitter malt and some roasted coffee and brown sugar. This flavor flows seemlessly into the spicy character of the rye malt. Then at the peak of the performance is the flavorful hops: there is mango and oranges especially there. It's a very fluid expression of several very good flavors that just work well together. Mouthfeel is characterized by good carbonation levels and a nice body overall. As usual, I am very impressed overall with the quality of the Smokestack series by Boulevard, even while largely disliking most of their regular offerings. This beer was a good strong offering. The only detriment I placed was in the nose because I feel like a Black IPA should have a little more of the dark malts present (as this is what "separates" it from a regular IPA/DIPA). That is simply a "style" thing, but overall I loved this beer.","estlinska","Apr 07, 2013"

A roasty bitter and a hoppy bitter, a rye spice and the right amount of creaminess in the body to balance. Filled with malt or quenched by hops? Spicy hops or spicy rye?

3.52,-13.1,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Something tells me a grainstorm would be terrible to try to live through... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brown-garnet topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises dark greens, light roasted malts, light toasted rye bread, and mild grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the greens coming in all salad strong and whatnot. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a good black rye IPA, one that certainly is a black rye IPA, but nothing exciting.","TMoney2591","Feb 25, 2013"
4.53,11.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Exactly where I like my Black IPAs/CDAs - aggressive hops, minimal malt and roast. The hop combo is one of my favorites (Simcoe, Amarillo, and Citra) and the brewers should be applauded for not going overboard with the specialty malts, with the rye addition being a unique twist to the style. Grainstorm keeps up the tradition of excellence I've come to expect from the Smokestack Series. Simply a great American craft beer here.","bump8628","Feb 25, 2013"

The smell of grapefruit became stronger with beer having been liberated from the bomber, but oddly did not get much more intense while nosing the glass. The look was as dark as a stout, but the head formation was much more massive, at three plus fingers thick. The head did not seem to go anywhere at all till I typed all this. The taste was very complex, with a constant interplay of light and dark malts and hops. There were notes of licorice, banana, coffee, dark toasted bread, grapefruit, and iced tea flying across the tongue in rapid succession. There was not a lot of heft to the body though, and the finish was a little watered down. I also did not notice much of a rye influence, as the dark malt seemed a lot more assertive. Boulevard produces another winner. What a surprise..not.","rajendra82","Feb 24, 2013"
4.08,0.7,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"A nicely done black IPA that utilizes the addition of rye to create a zesty twist on what is now becoming a US mainstay (i.e., the DIPA). Boulevard did a nice job in creating a well-balanced, subtle, and nicely complex take on this style.","beergoot","Feb 24, 2013"

4.09,1,4.25,4,4,4.25,4.25,"maybe the most appropriately named beer to come out in awhile. the malt bill on this is colossal, and the rye malt is so intense, huge body, super yum. the pour is thick and dark. milkshakey with a deep fain red brown depth, pushing up on black, with a mocha colored soft head maybe four inches high and long lasting. amazing. the nose is grainy as hell, spicy roasty rye and barley, a good alcohol kick, and tons of hops. pine and straight English bitter varieties, just a massive nose. the taste is really heavy malt with very little sweetness. some german and English doughy flavors, but mostly just roasted American two row and brutally intense rye, black as black can be. hopped well, bitter in the finish but bittersweet cocoay throughout. long finish of beautiful complexity and some surly attitude. a well hidden abv, but you could hide anthrax, your girlfriend's rolodex, and a shorty of cheap vodka in this one without affecting the flavor. no joke. full as a body can be, but made mild my the carbonation which is really active and creamy, almost akin to a nitro dispense. drinkable on your own, but a good bottle to share too. overall an impressive beer, the smokestack series kills it. I also found this on my roof after an enjoyable scavenger hunt for valentines day, which only sweetened the pot...","StonedTrippin","Feb 18, 2013"
