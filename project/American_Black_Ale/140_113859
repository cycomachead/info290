1.94,-49.5,4.5,3,1,3.5,1,"I didn't really know what to expect from a "Black IPA". I've had a few different black beers before, and i've had many different IPA's. Never together, and now I know why. Best way I can describe this is burnt citrus. Unappetizing for me. Literally one of the only beers I've not been able to finish and found it's way down the drain. I'm glad it was just part of the 4-way IPA variety pack I bought and not a 6 pack of just this!","NCMatt","Saturday at 05:27 PM"

Aftertaste fades quickly for the IBU level. Not bad but would probably only drink this when I am also eating something to contrast the hops.","Lard_City","Friday at 03:04 PM"

4.83,25.8,5,4.5,5,5,4.75,"Poured a bit hard with a 1:1 beer:head ratio at around 45 degrees F. into a pint mug.  Head dissipates so slow leaving huge, beautiful chunks of lacing all the way around.  Dark brown with burgundy around the edges, sort of looks like a porter until the smell.  Smells of cascade hops, west coast style, Sierra Nevada standard like a dark Torpedo scent in a way.  Deep and dark molasses and hops hit the nose with a mixed dank mustiness.  Medium bodied with carbonation that makes it seem fuller than it really is.  Bitter.  Quite dank and tasty but not very sweet west coast hops, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses on dark bread toast with butter! Lingering aftertaste sort of like campfire blackened marshmallow.  As it warms, the charred chocolate campfire treats and signature cascade hop bitterness lingers ever more.  If only all beers could taste this good. Trick I think with this one is to let the aromatics out with a rough pour at just below 50 degrees F.  Kind of tones down the acidity while enhancing the natural flavor.","nizzle8287","Feb 17, 2015"

4.24,10.4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Translucent deep brown as it pours in to the New Belgium tulip. Impenetrably black once it collects in the glass. Remarkable 3 finger head of coffee colored foam that settles gradually in to a resilient layer, leaving impressive lacing all the way around. This could easily be mistaken for a robust imperial stout based on the appearance alone. Chocolate and coffee bean aromas mingle with a fresh, leafy hop bouquet. Toasted biscuit notes give the scent some depth. Smoky, roasted coffee bitterness bounces off of spicy, herbal hop notes creating an artful exposition of flavor. Hints of dark chocolate and minty pine come together in the finish to give the subtle impression of a peppermint patty. Medium bodied with creamy, active carbonation that really plays up the roasty bite. Perhaps a little slick for such a dark, foreboding brew, but executed well nonetheless. The pithy zing clings to your palate with a cumulative effect, reminding you that it's definitely an IPA. A little booziness on the breath also lets you know that it's a sturdy brew. The combined bitterness of the burnt malts and assertive hops yield an aspirin-like quality that's surely not for everyone. But, for me, this was pretty divine. Another win for Sierra Nevada and beer drinkers the country over. So glad they have expanded East!!!","JohnnyI","Feb 10, 2015"

3.92,2.1,5,3,4,5,4,"Purchased Mid Jan., 2015 (already has 2015 on the bottle) at a Publix in Tampa. Pours a nice murky black with pillowy eggshell head. Aromas are typical IPA: pine, hops, resin, a little malt, and hints of grapefruit pith and citrus juices. Flavors are darker, with tart, roasted hazelnuts, smoke, and burnt-ness that accompany the aromas. Has a really bitter, charcoaly aftertaste that kinda sticks with ya. Body is in between that of a stout and IPA, with some silky/creaminess. Overall, this is a "black-tar affair" of a beer in that it is eloquent, dark, and fucking brutal... not in a bad way, just in a manly, campfire-on-a-frozen-lake kinda way.

4.05,5.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured out opaque black and produced a massive three finger off white head that left beautiful skirts of lacing down the glass. On the nose it gave off a mellow dark roast with some coffee, citrus, and grapefruit which went back and forth from malt roast to hops.   The taste is like the nose with a bitterness, dark roast, coffee, citrus, pine, all coming through strong and coming out at different times.  Sometimes I get more citrus/pine and some times I get more of the dark bittered roast qualities.  Comes in medium bodied and slick in the mouth and comes across dry which is perfect for this beer.  This is a really enjoyable black IPA, I wish Sierra Nevada would make this a regular in their line up.  Best beer in their mixed IPA pack and one I wish to try again, Cheers!","DrinkMoreBigBeers","Jan 11, 2015"

The nose is more IPA like, pine and floral hops over a light chocolate with roast notes.  Medium body with a slick texture that is almost creamy.  Below normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The unique flavor profile is quite nice, balanced and complex.  It begins with citrus hop, then flows to pine over a light chocolate sweetness. Bitterness follows that is citric rind in nature over a very light smoke from the roast - very well balanced so each component is evident, but not over powering.  The smooth finish leaves you with a lingering citric bitterness with a chocolate note.  An Outstanding example of the style.","tillmac62","Aug 24, 2014"

4.02,4.7,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Poured a gorgeous deep black/brown with red highlights around the edges and a finger and a half of beautiful tan head. It looks fantastic, like a good stout. Scents of pine resin, peat moss, undertones of tropical fruit, with an emphasis on mango, notes of dark chocolate, coffee and roast malt and faint undertones of orange and lemon zest. A nice aroma that combines rich roasted malt aromas with bright fruity and pine-like notes from hops. Quite nice. Flavor begins lightly sweet, with notes of toffee and dark chocolate mingling with orange flesh and orange and grapefruit peel. Pine resin joins grapefruit peel, roast malt, black coffee and light sweetness in the middle. The finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, and light roast malt. Aftertaste is dry with notes of roast malt, pine resin and grapefruit peel. A good black ale flavor profile that combines a stout with IPA level hopping quite nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation and a resinous, slightly drying feel. Quite nice and very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good American Black Ale. It has the nice hybrid of stout and IPA in its aroma and taste and combines it with a very drinkable mouthfeel. A good experiment that is worth trying.","Auraan","Jul 31, 2014"

3.56,-7.3,4.25,4.5,3,3.75,3.25,"Had while at a local grill pub with family. The first thing you'll notice is the bright hop aromas enimating from the glass. It's not clear if they used fresh hops, but the smell is comparable to SN's annual "Celebration" seasonal. Pours a deep, dark black hue that lives up to it's namesake. Little to no head present, even with a moderately aggressive pour. As for the taste...well, the smell builds up a lot of hype, but the taste is purely middle-of-the-road IPA. Fruity, piney hops and plenty of bitterness, and not much else. The deep abyssal black hue of the brew and the special roasted malts ultimately don't matter as the bitterness overpowers any semblance of a malt profile from start to finish. It's a decently thick drink, close to stout levels of creaminess, and finishes clean with nothing lingering on the palate. It is an interesting little experiment, and I want to see where they can take it, but until they find out how to keep the hop flavour and cut the over-aggressive hop bite, I'll have to pass on any future iterations of Blindfold and it's derivitives.","Slashytits","Jul 15, 2014"

The dark malt really gave a strong roasty-toasty flavor to the ale. Subtle coffee notes and roasted chocolate were in there too. The roasted flavor was over a sweet malt flavor that led into the sweet grapefruit floral hops and a classic IPA bitter burst at the end. Good carbonation combine with a more full-bodied IPA then is the norm, a nice combination. Overall, a well-balanced and fun IPA. Not your everyday IPA, but a real treat worth seeking out for a night time drink.","juanny","Jun 30, 2014"

3.67,-4.4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown-highlighted, blackish coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy, off-white surface coat of head. Aromas of roasted coffee in the backbone, with tangy citrus notes and hints of resin. Flavors are very well balanced, with a blast of bitter and roasted coffee traveling across the palate neck and neck with the tangy and tart citrus notes. Resinous and piney characteristics add depth to the flavors, too. The beer is light and slightly effervesced in mouth, bringing a quick end to the roasted and bitter coffee aftertaste. The finish is fairly quick, as well, and a little on the frothed/effervesced side, and a slight resinous and coffee linger. Interesting brew.","GarthDanielson","May 12, 2014"

Nice creamy tan head and medium-thick clinging lacing. Aroma is hoppy, floral, caramel, sweet, not grapefruit notes. Flavor is mild to moderate hops, nothing like Torpedo, mild dark roast malt, a bit sweet, coffee, a bit of dark chocolate, very nice but a bit tame.

Very nice aromas with good balance of citrus/pine hop and dark roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, toast, pine, floral, grass, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange/lemon zest, coffee, roast, cocoa, light char, toast, pine, floral, grass, and floral/roast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of citrus/pine hops and dark roasted malt flavors; with a very crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice black IPA. All around good balance of citrus/pine hops and dark roasted malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on.

4.02,4.7,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Pours almost pitch black, there are ruby highlights at the edges when held toward the light, light tan head looks kind of like a dry Irish stout in the glass. Nice full thicket of head with chunky textures. Aroma dark roasted malts, earthy almost mint like herbal hop qualities. It also has a nuttiness that's complementing the dark roasted malt character with some generic ale fruitiness that may be characteristic of the hops as well. Flavor I'm getting more of that nutty character with the bitterness of the hops call me crazy but I'm experiencing something that almost comes off like peanut butter for a minute...maybe I've drank too much DuClaw Sweet Baby Jesus lately, but that's what I'm getting even though I know that's not intended I think it's some interaction between the roasted malts and the hop character here. Caramelized roasted malts, dark chocolate edges more like drinking a very hoppy porter with a bit more malt expression than your average dry dark roasted malt finish, the bitterness here is definitely from the hop varieties used. A very good sipping beer complex herbal/fruity/citrus hop edge wrapped in dark nutty caramelized malts that border on complex iced coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied great textures on the palate, a tad oily but flowing carbonation clears that off the palate quite nicely dry herbal/dark roasted malt finish. Overall, a very good version of the style, it's hard to come by a good Black IPA, I hope this sampler remains available for awhile...I could picture myself needing more of this.","WVbeergeek","Mar 17, 2014"

Well, I say "balanced" though the hop bitterness is clearly winning over any roasty qualities. Resinous, leafy spice with a little char in the aftertaste.

This beer had ok drinkability, it was a little smooth, fairly clean, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think one would be enough for me since I really don't have the urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, I thought they were both good and true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but but the malt aspect and the hop aspect were just ok. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, there's many Black IPA's that I enjoy much more then this one and I might recommend this beer to someone just getting into the style but I wouldn't call it a great example of a Black IPA. All in all I didn't think this beer was that bad, but I didn't think it was that great either, it kind of fell right in the middle in most aspects and I would much rather have B Craft Black IPA, or Short's Goodnight Bodacious. I would say that this one and Torpedo were my favorite of the mixed IPA pack, but as for the new ones this was my favorite, but as a whole I wasn't too impressed with this new variety pack and I wouldn't buy it again.

The aroma is complex with lots of roasty malts carrying notes of coffee and caramel as well as a generous amount of hop notes bordering on the piney side of the spectrum. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy just as one would hope for and expect from this style of ale. The flavor is an awesome balance of deep roasted malts and bitter west coast hops.
