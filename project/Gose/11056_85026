It is however a very good beer, but not usually what I look for in this style.  I would however recommend this though for fans of the style to give it a go.","smakawhat","Feb 14, 2015"

3.92,3.2,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"O-This is a pretty tasty beer. It manages to pack a fair bit of flavor into a low ABV package without tasting gimmicky or "tarted up." It is more aggressive than classic German gose, but less salty than many popular examples of the style, e.g., Westbrook. I actually like it this way. I could drink a few of these on a summer afternoon without any problem. My only knock would be the price...this guy is a bit spendy to drink in volume.","spoony","Dec 27, 2014"

3.93,3.4,4,4,3.75,4.25,4,"There are no fitter descriptors than balanced and delicate, with nice coriander, herbal,  dill and citric notes abound. The palate - the real challenge in gose-brewing - is involving and expertly achieved; The balance between the salinity, acidity, ABV and sourness make this a memorable quencher and really set this one apart. At the tongue the aromatics are restrained but fair and fitting overall.","endovelico",
