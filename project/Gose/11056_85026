3.92,3.2,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"O-This is a pretty tasty beer. It manages to pack a fair bit of flavor into a low ABV package without tasting gimmicky or "tarted up." It is more aggressive than classic German gose, but less salty than many popular examples of the style, e.g., Westbrook. I actually like it this way. I could drink a few of these on a summer afternoon without any problem. My only knock would be the price...this guy is a bit spendy to drink in volume.","spoony","Jan 06, 2015"

The palate - the real challenge in gose-brewing - is involving and expertly achieved; The balance between the salinity, acidity, ABV and sourness make this a memorable quencher and really set this one apart. At the tongue the aromatics are restrained but fair and fitting overall.","endovelico","Dec 19, 2014"
4.24,11.6,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"one of the better gose beers i have ever had, its so bright and herbal, with notes of green tea, sweet lemon balm, coriander seed, lime leaf, and something more floral even, hibiscus or something. its complex but its clean, minimally tart for the style, just very light and drinkable. the salt here is nice too, gives the beer some body and a nice mineral character. with an abv this low too, its one i can drink plenty of, and for what it is, the price isnt bad at all. i am surprised to look and see i havent had any beers from these guys before, i see their stuff around periodically, but have always been turned off by high prices. this one is really really fair. the flavors here are as bright and summery and herbaceous as i have seen in the style, carbonation is fantastic, and the wheat malt base is very flavorful. exceptional example of the style, a nice little twist of being different in here too. i need to find some more!","StonedTrippin","Dec 17, 2014"

Hors Série Gose is one of the few that has been able to break that trend, as the saltiness is the perfect cure for this one's assertively acidic flavour profile. Now I am pumped to try a few more examples of this style - hopefully its growing popularity will encourage other brewers to give this style a shot. Highly recommended.","thehyperduck","Sep 08, 2014"

Not too sour, maybe some light tartness to it but that was about all I registered. Creaminess from the wheat is there in body but a lot of the flavour is commanded by the salt. A tasty and light session beer, enjoy the complex tart fruit and floral character mixed with a strong earthy spice. Well balanced as it delivers a long but crisply satisfying finish. Good session beer, though the salty brine was a bit much for the most part and it did have a distinctly saltwater character to it initially. Worth trying.","mick303","Aug 06, 2014"
