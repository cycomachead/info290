3.58,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Bottle at Redlight Redlight. Pours a slightly hazy pale orange with a good amount of tight, white head that held about 30 seconds before fading into a thin collar. Good lacing. A weird kind of funk to the aroma of this beer, almost like a spoiled cheese. I also get some orangey citrus and dry grass. Taste is very similar. The citrus up front, the grass in the middle, and the bleu cheese funk throughout. Nice carbonation, medium to high; and a nice medium-light body.","mverity","Oct 13, 2013"

4.01,4.7,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Poured from the bottle into a hefe glass. Looks like a normal wheat beer. Aroma is light and not as smoky as expected. The flavor though is very unique. The sourness hits your first, then the smokiness lingers on your palate after you swallow. Very smooth and clean beer. Really enjoyed this one. I love the intermingling of smoke and sour. One of my new favorite styles.","morebeergood","Oct 10, 2013"
