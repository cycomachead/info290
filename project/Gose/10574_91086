4.13,9.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.25,"I poured the beer into a regular hefeweizen glass.  Cloudy once I poured the yeast into the beer.  The head is white and thick.  The smell is grassy, not what I expected from a spruced gose.  The taste on the other hand, is just what expect and great.  It's got the saltiness I expect, and a little something extra which I think is the spruce.  Overall, a good beer.","deg","Feb 14, 2015"

4.05,7.7,,,,,,"This zippy light-honey colored offering, is quite literally bursting with a fragrant layering of peach, mango and spring flowers. Focused and refined where the  residual sweetness is playing off the lemony tartness and traditional salinity. Refreshing and elegant overall even if rather hollow and short.","endovelico",
