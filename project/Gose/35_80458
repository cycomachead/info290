3.75,8.7,,,,,,"Not much hints at this being a Gose as it has a deep copper hue and a thick foam. Hints of white wine, lemon lime, coriander, honey and molasses on the nose. The flavor is very malty, with some dried dark fruit. The coriander is more evident in the finish as I taste some lemon lime soda water as well. Perhaps a little salty, this seems to miss the Gose mark but I find it good to drink.","KYGunner","Aug 03, 2014"
