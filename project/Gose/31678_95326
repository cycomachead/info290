Super light and drinkable, but has that little edge of real flavor and crispness over the aforementioned macro and others like it. Gose will probably never be a favorite style of mine, but this sample has all the characteristics to make me respect and appreciate the category.","1000lbgrizzly","Mar 28, 2015"

4.36,15.3,5,4,4.5,5,4,"Very good beer. Appearance is traditional with a smallish off-white head that soon settles and a hazy yellow color. Aroma is grain and yeast. On my first sip I got wheat, grain, a little tart & coriander, but no salt. Second sip got all of that but then got a little salt too. Body is just right. Very nice drinking beer. Wouldn't mind another.","drpimento","Mar 22, 2015"
