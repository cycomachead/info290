All orange/shades of amber with a slight golden edged hue to it. Head naturally disappears quickly, leaving nothing but clusters of bubbles ringing the glass. Great nose for a gose (ha, it rhymed!), very bright and zesty, like salad dressing you want to drink. Taste doesn't disappoint, lime zest, vinaigrette dressing, spice, and a great salty finish. Would be awesome with craft mustard on pretzels. Slightly thicker mouthfeel that most gose beers I've had (or remembered), but still refreshingly crisp and effervescent.

4.21,3.7,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured a cloudy orange body with one finger of thick, fluffy white head. A very nice looking beer. Scents of salt water, delicate German malt aromas, a light lactic sourness, light bready malt and a light fruit ester presence. Overall impression of aroma is of a true to form gose, very nice. Flavor begins highly sour, with notes of lemon zest, lemon juice and a slight lactic sourness and a medium-light saltiness balancing the sourness. Middle opens up further sourness along with a light hint of grainy malt. Finish is dry and highly sour with notes of grainy malt, lemon juice and salt water. Aftertaste is sour lactic acid, lemon juice, fading to grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a good Gose that tends more towards the sour side of the style, a good take on the style. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and a sour, puckering feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a true to style gose, nothing wrong. Overall this is a good gose. It has a nice sour flavor, fitting the style, keeping the saltiness present and complementary and having an excellent aroma and mouthfeel. A very nice example of the style.","Auraan","Feb 21, 2015"

Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, green apple, wheat, biscuit, light honey, coriander, sea salt, white vinegar, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Outstanding aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/acidic yeast, spice/salt, and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, green apple, wheat, biscuit, light honey, coriander, sea salt, white vinegar, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, green apple, coriander, sea salt, white vinegar, wheat, biscuit, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/acidic yeast, spice, and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spice/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic/salty mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding gose style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, spice/salt, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity.

3.86,-4.9,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,4.25,"a great gose, maybe the most sour example of the style i have had. so much pucker here, and a bigger malt bill and body than i am used to in the style, more than just wheat, or more deeply toasted wheat that gives both a light amber color and a bunch of body to this. its hazy and weird looking for the style though, and doesnt have a ton of head, it certainly doesnt hold it long. the nose is light on the coriander and heavy on the lacto, sour fermented as much as it is traditional sour mash or kettle sour in its complexion, where is where its mature sourness comes from i have to imagine. the salt is light in the flavor but it adds body and accents the sourness really well. i didnt no know they canned this (or anything), so its cool to imagine it in that context too. ive never had such a sour one of these though, its almost caustic, and hurts the drinkability that the style is supposed to have. its also a little slower down because of all the body, but i cant help but be impressed with this overall, its dynamic and fun, and i will definitely buy it again if i see it around. a little more carbonation would really help, but i like this a lot as it is, appreciably different. bravo!","StonedTrippin","Dec 20, 2014"

I'll give it the benefit of the doubt but Westbrook is far better and Boulevard Hibiscus Gose is more enjoyable.  Worth trying if you come across it.","IrishColonial","Dec 01, 2014"
