4.08,2.8,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"A delicious, crisp, tart, salty, refreshing take on gose.  The blood orange is noticed but does not dominate.  Good salty/sour balance.  No fake/artificial flavor notes and not overly restrained like some takes.  A nearly perfect summer beer.","BlarpBlarp","Monday at 04:19 AM"

4.18,5.3,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a clear orange body with a half-finger of bubbly white head. Overall impression of appearance is of a Gose in head, with the blood oranges shown in the color of the body. Scents of salt water, with an ocean-like quality, mingling with medium-light aromas of blood orange and spicy coriander and a light earth funk from the yeast and light lactic acid. Overall impression of aroma is of a typical Gose, true to form, but with a good use of blood orange to add an additional bright aroma to the beer. Quite nice. Flavor begins lightly sour, with notes of lactic acid with a plan yogurt quality, moderate saltiness, tangy wheat malt flavors at moderate levels and a light level of blood orange. Middle gains in sourness, with notes of lactic acid still providing the sourness, bright fruitiness of blood orange at moderate levels and a moderate level of saltiness and tangy wheat. Finish is highly tart with strong notes of lactic acid, moderate saltiness, a nice tangy wheat malt still present and a medium-light blood orange flavor. Aftertaste is tart with notes of lactic acid, grainy, tangy wheat malt and salt. Overall impression of flavor is of a classic Gose, tart, salty and true to style, but enhanced by tangy, sweet blood orange. A very refreshing flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and puckering, drying mouthfeel that urges you to take another sip. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderful Gose that is true to style and very refreshing. Overall this is an amazing Gose. It is traditional in its base, but the blood orange takes the aroma and flavor to new levels and makes this a fine, refreshing beer. Fantastic.","Auraan","Friday at 06:42 PM"
