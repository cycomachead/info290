4.5,7.9,,,,,,"The only Gose I've found I liked. Some say it's too salty, not for me. It was refreshing, tart and crushable. This is recommended.","Shroud0fdoom","Aug 14, 2014"
3.75,-10.1,,,,,,"The nose is tart, citrus peel, yeast, good funk.  It has a very rustic barnyard note.  The flavor is traditional gose, lots of salt, some wood, but I can't place the barrel.  Lemon zest at the end.  This is good, clean, but I never think of a gose as refreshing due to the saltiness.  Fun to try.","nmann08",
