4.71,19.2,5,4,5,5,4.75,"This is not an in your face beer. Uniquely American but European in aim. I think this is my top two all time favorite gose after Westbrook but they're very different from each other. Westbrook is more traditional in aim and cleaner with a more watery texture. The salt in the Westbrook gose is also much more prominent which is not very traditional. This is maybe a top 10 all time favorite beer.","indesertum","Mar 16, 2015"
