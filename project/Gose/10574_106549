3.92,-5.3,,,,,,"Bottle. Pours a opaque, golden color. Minimal head. The color is interesting, as is the aroma. It smells slightly cheesy with some unripe fruits. Lemon aroma as well. Reminds me of kiwis, too. The flavor is sharp and bright. Tart fruit flesh, lemons, rhubarb, kiwi. Mostly dry. Funky with a bit of cheese rind. Salinity is minimal. Barnyard flavors. Cider similarities. Salt actually starts to sneak up on me the more I enjoy this brew. Light bodied. Surprisingly high carbonation. Savory yet crisp. Dry. Very interesting. Very rustic and fruity. A tasty, unique Gose.","VelvetExtract","Oct 20, 2014"
