4.03,3.6,3,3.75,4.5,4,3.75,"Pours an opaque deep straw producing barely 1.5 fingers of  shortlived, foamy, white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma has a low but nice wheat profile & I detect what I would call pilsner malts. It is crisp, clean & dry with hints of tart fruit & brine (which the brewery says should be be below what humans can distinguish as salt). Taste opens with  lactic acid sourness, wheat & a hint of coriander & finishes peppery, clean, crisp, dry with faint salinity (again) & tart fruit. Aftertaste is salty wheat, coriander with briney lemon, lime & tart green apple. Easier to drink than the American versions I have tried due to less lactic acid sourness & salt. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, lightly astringent, prickly & dry.","mothmanscott","Jan 31, 2015"

3.91,0.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours a straw yellow with lively looking carbonation, small head and minimal lace. Aroma first hits you with salty tones but becomes more malty as it warms. I dug the taste; not too salty or sour, hint of lemon and enough of a malty backbone to make it drinkable. Good feel; light and refreshing. Great for a hot day. The first time I tried Gose I poured it down the drain. This one, my 2nd one, I liked. Either it is becoming an acquired taste or I simply like this one better.","Gajo74","Jan 13, 2015"
