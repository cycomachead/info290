4.24,-0.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"A hazy, light straw yellow with a dense white head, this looks good. The nose is brilliant. Bright, sour, focused, with a blend of funk, earth, mushrooms, a touch of sulfur, salt and coriander all on a wheaty, bready base, this smells excellent. The palate mirrors these flavor notes, with the robust wheat base, dextrinous and lending a backbone for the lactic and Bretty flavors. Refreshing. Very nice.","DefenCorps","Feb 23, 2015"

Flavor is vivid dried apricots with mild coriander and brine. Really fruity, brett C, high carbonation, dry finish. Really came together well.","illidurit","0"
