4.24,-0.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"A hazy, light straw yellow with a dense white head, this looks good. The nose is brilliant. Bright, sour, focused, with a blend of funk, earth, mushrooms, a touch of sulfur, salt and coriander all on a wheaty, bready base, this smells excellent. The palate mirrors these flavor notes, with the robust wheat base, dextrinous and lending a backbone for the lactic and Bretty flavors. Refreshing. Very nice.","DefenCorps","Feb 20, 2015"
