4.09,0.7,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Flavor is definitely on the American side of the gose spectrum, but not as extreme as most. The cherry character adds a great character. Kinda like cherry pie.","barczar","Saturday at 10:21 PM"

4.1,1,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle - strawberry soda color - bit of foam and light lacing. Smell is very light (after it warms a little it comes through) - a bit of sweet bread malt and berry. Taste has a bit of salt up front with nice tart cherry, follows with a touch of the malt and lingering cherry. Feel is light and slightly effervescent. Very happy to find this in 4 packs at the local grocery store!","jancona","Saturday at 02:37 AM"

3.95,-2.7,4.5,3.25,4.25,4,4,"Not as sharp or tart as a lot of Gose beers, but it has a solid flavor profile that isn't too saccharine or sweet, but has a nice bouncy flavor with a good cherry flavor & a good hit of malt yeast to round out the mouthfeel.","ajm5108",
