3.76,-3.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Gose is not my favorite beer style....far from it.....this one however is palatable.  The beer poured clear with pink hue and white head that is not lacing.  The scent carries floral notes.  The taste is tart with coriander spice.  Themouthfeel is lighter in body with subtle carbonation.  Overall this is a probably the best Gose I've had....just don't like the style.","WoodBrew","Feb 12, 2015"
3.84,-1.3,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Pours an almost clear, pinkish pale amber producing 2 fingers of effervescent, shortlived, foamy, white (faintly pink) head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is tart lactic acid, coriander & brine with a pungent hint of vinegar & something faintly strawberry like; malt profile is low but I detect a little wheat & a floral component that might be from the hibiscus flowers(?); crisp & dry. Taste opens fruity (green apples, strawberry & lemon/lime) & dry with salinity & lactic acid tartness, coriander, thin wheat & a floral hint. Less tart, but peppery in the finish; crisp, and dry in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with high carbonation, a little prickly, puckering, mouthwatering & very dry.","mothmanscott","Feb 08, 2015"

3.13,-19.5,4.25,2.5,3,3.75,3.5,"Smell is a floral, sweet tart, small note of coriander. Head has very little retention with even less tracing. Taste is a slam of tart sour up front with a smoother flowery middle and ends with a unique salty dry finish. Drop a couple of sweet tarts into a salty dog and muddle a flower and you have this beer. Overall unique and interesting, I'm not a big sour fan to begin with though.","KellenCampbell5","Jan 03, 2015"
3.35,-13.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Not bad, but a bit underwhelming. I was hoping for more sea salt, or more sour, or more flowers, or moreâ€¦.something. All the various ingredients are tame & forgiving, & I like my bitches, I mean beer, aggressive & forward. Decent enough.","maximum12","Jan 01, 2015"
