3.75,-2.8,,,,,,"The perfect style of beer for the Texas summer. Light in color and body, the limes are apparent in both the aroma and the flavor. The salt hits about middle to slightly after. Malt is very unpronounced and shows up toward the finish. Hard to tell if the coriander has any influence as the lime predominates.","LittleDon","Aug 31, 2014"
