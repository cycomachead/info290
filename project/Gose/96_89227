I used a heavy-hand to begin the pour, resulting in a pseudo-cascade, settling into a finger off bone-white (salt-white?) head with fair retention, dropping into a skim across the top of the beer. Color was a button-bright sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose smelled like sea spray. I kid you not, I felt like I was back on the forecastle of any of the four ships on which I served. Man, my mouth was watering, both from the memory and at the prospect of what was to come! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was salty, sure and slightly spicy, but in both instances, they seemed muted. This lacked Ooomph! to make it a really standout Gose. Finish was dry, but it could have been so much more.","woodychandler","Apr 13, 2014"

There is a pleasant barley malt flavor with a mild hop bitterness and just a hint of spice (from the coriander I assume, but it is not strong the way coriander sometimes shows up in Belgian style ales).","Foyle","Dec 14, 2013"
