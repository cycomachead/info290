3.85,8.1,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"O: Overall this is an interesting beer - the combination of cilantro, lime, and roasted red pepper integrate in an interesting fashion with the slightly sour and salty gose. Seems more like a combination of flavors found in food than in a beer but glad I grabbed this one.","dbrauneis","Jan 05, 2015"

2.94,-17.4,2.75,3,3,2.5,3,"Overall: Interesting but wouldn't buy again. The red pepper schtick is too overwhelming, but again I do find it relatively drinkable. I like Against The Grain in general but this one didn't deliver as expected because I was super pumped for some serious cilantro taste, which I didn't get.","economice","Oct 16, 2014"
3.01,-15.4,2.75,3.5,2.75,3,3,"I like the ambition but I don't think the roasted red peppers work at all in this beer with the lactic and citrus sourness going on. The flavor of the calamansi is very nice and would actually make a killer Gose on its own.","cbutova","Oct 16, 2014"
