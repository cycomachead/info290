4.17,0,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"The tight malt, drinkability of this beer and interesting fruity/melony aroma and flavors make this gose stand out.  It's hard to judge carbonation but it could also stand with a bit more sour.  Really well done.  I hope this style takes off,  the craft world could do with a few more like this one.","rawfish","Dec 12, 2014"
