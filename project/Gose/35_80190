Malty goodness just rests on your palate while still maintaining a refreshing quench.  Complete lack of hop bitterness and a one-of-a-kind twang that I've never tasted before, finishes with a pleasant spice note (coriander).","BeerEsquire","Mar 28, 2015"

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from the first set of growlers filled at their JP brewery. The beer pours a nice foamy white head that dissipates moderately. The beer itself is a clear light copper. The beer leaves quite a bit of thin lacing that lasts a while. The beer has a fairly light smell but not out of place for a gose. The notes tend to be coriander with a light hop profile and supplemented by salt with a hint of pepper. The taste is similar but with a stronger bitter hop and salt profile. The coriander is more of a background taste that complements salt. The mouthfeel is fairly towards the light end of medium bodied. Very refreshing and smooth. Overall, a pretty good after workout beer and worth getting while it's available.","HattedClassic","Apr 08, 2014"

Mainly notes of coriander and wheat. The taste is good. Medium to lighter body. Wheat and coriander are the main flavors. No real sweetness or bitterness. Crisp, refreshing. Pretty nice brew.","Boto","Jun 11, 2013"

3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the Sam Adams tour: Poured a hazy light orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coriander is well integrated with the malt base. Taste is refreshing with good notes of coriander and malt with light salty finish. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Well brewed and something I wouldn’t mind to have regular access during sumnmertime.","Phyl21ca","May 07, 2012"

Overall it was a pretty decent beer, but it seemed a little dumbed down from the more traditional Leipziger version I've had. It tasted a little like a slightly salty version of their summer brew. While it may not be as bold as a traditional version, they did a pretty good job at incorporating those flavors into something the average craft beer drinker would like.","billab914","Apr 19, 2012"
