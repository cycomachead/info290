4.41,-0.5,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Verdict: A lovely Gose from de Garde, bright, delicate, refreshing and super crushable. The fruit flavor is fresh and juicy, plenty sour without being crippling and the coriander and sea salt flavors add a nice counterweight, stunning for the style.","kevanb","Feb 21, 2015"
