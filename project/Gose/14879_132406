3.55,-3.8,3,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Overall: An enjoyable gose, though neither quite as sour nor as salty as one might hope for. Still, it does make for a refreshing citrus beer, without dragging along ridiculous levels of hops.","UrbanCaveman","Feb 18, 2015"

3.79,2.7,4,3.75,4,3,3.75,"Recommended. Despite the high ABV this is definitely more of a traditional Gose than are many of the sharply citric, and quite popular, ones on shelf today.","cavedave","Jan 14, 2015"

3.26,-11.7,3,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"22 ounce bottle.  Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly.  There's a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is on the weak side (but it's not bad), the brew smells like lemon peel, white grapes, green apples, wheat/grainy malt, lime, and a bit of salt.  It tastes like lemon, salt, wheat/grainy malt, citrus peel and some earthiness.  I think it's more salty than tart, I expected more tartness out of this.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with low/moderate carbonation.  Overall it's decent and I'm glad I tried it, but at $8.99 a bomber I wouldn't buy it again.  I can't say I've had many Gose ales, but I thought most of if not all of the other ones I've tried were better than this was.","bluejacket74","Dec 23, 2014"
