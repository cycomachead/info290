It was slightly tart, but lacked the salt and lactic flavor I was looking for in a gose.

Head retention is OK, and there wasn't much lacing at all. The brew smells like marionberries, flowers (which I assume is from the hibiscus), and wheat. It tastes like marionberries, wheat, and a bit of floralness (once again, from the hibiscus). Moutfheel/body is light/medium, it's easy to drink and has a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a decent enough brew, although I'm not sure if I would call this a gose or not. Regardless, it wasn't bad at all. $8.49 a 4-pack.","bluejacket74","Aug 11, 2013"

The nose is light with some berry and floral characteristics but no typical Gose wheat or salt water. The flavors too, light berry and some hibiscus character. It is lightly tart, but its slight. If anything, there is more sweet berry than I anticipated. It is very light in body with little carbonation. It's approachable but nothing really impressive.

Interestingly enough, the smells actually seem to disappear as the beer warms. Taste is slightly tart with sour berry and hibiscus flavors up front followed by grain and spice flavors on the finish. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a somewhat crisp and slightly acidic mouthfeel.

Overall, in my limited experience with the Gose style, this wasn't really a typical example, but was still quite enjoyable. No aspect of this beer dominated, but the beer was very well combined.

3.91,18.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I'm totally charmed by this stuff. If it's not anything like the ancient style, it's what I like about the World Beer movement. Take inspiration and make it drinkable. They could make another version without the training wheels, though. Another of the user-friendly oddball beers from Widmer.","mactrail","Jun 11, 2012"
3.01,-9.1,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,"- Kind of a bland attempt at a Gose. It's got wheat, brewing salts, and a touch of funk, but it isn't quite there. Certainly a style of beer that shouldn't be done in large batches and with any brewers house yeast or fermentation style. This is strictly a style all in its own, and should be brewed as such. It wasn't tart enough for me, funky enough, nor did it have the fruit I was expecting after seeing its color. Want a good Gose? Hit up Upright or Breakside. Or better yet, grab a nice Berliner Weisse and add a little marionberry syrup to it.","Docer","Jun 09, 2012"
