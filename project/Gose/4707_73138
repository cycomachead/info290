3.89,-0.8,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"someone told me that this recently medaled at the world beer cup or something, but i have yet to confirm that. its a heck of a nice goes no matter whether it won something or not, it should have. honey colored, not as pale as others, and with some clarity too until the bottom of the bottle. smallish white head fades fast, but there is plenty of bubbles in the beer. nose is nice and tart, lactic acidity is mid range, nothing caustic, but nice and zippy too. coriander is on the lighter side in both smell and taste, which is great, sometimes these get too foody and herbal, more mealish than beerish. this one stays light despite a richer color, and a little more body than the style average in my experience. salt is there, actually having a strange and paradoxical effect of making my mouth water after the swallow, and with the nice refreshing carbonation this is a wonderful beer for a warm afternoon. wheat malt is fresh and crockery. light citrus with the sourness, lemon rind or grapefruit flesh or something like that, when ice cold its perfect, but when it warms up and the pour gets dreggy, its not as flattering. definitely worth seeking out.","StonedTrippin","Feb 18, 2014"
