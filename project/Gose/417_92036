Normally I think “refreshing” is a rather lazy adjective to use in describing a beer, like when female houseguests mindlessly refer to my bedroom as “Kafkaesque,” even though my furnishings evoke none of the subtle humor of Kafka’s work. This beer, however, is refreshing as hell. Because it’s like sitting next to the goddamn ocean.","mynie","Nov 03, 2014"
