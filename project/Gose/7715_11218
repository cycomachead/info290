Aroma of sweet wheat and light citric tartness, a hint of coriander. Flavor is light wheat, citrus, mild lactic tartness, hint of coriander and salt; interesting light lemon tartness in the finish at the edges of the tongue. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. A really nice example of the style, with all flavors handled lightly, but nicely balanced. The tartness is well supported by the wheat body. Both coriander and salt are deftly integrated. I'm not a sour beer fan, but found this nicely made, lightly tart beer to be refreshing and tasty.","LiquidAmber","Feb 11, 2015"

This one is slightly more complex and agressive, sourer and saltier, the other one is more refreshing. Nice beer, but for me the style is much less exciting than, for example, geueze or witbier. Similar to Berliner Weisse. Interesting, unique, must-try for beer geeks - yes, but if that would be the only available beer style out there, I'd drink much more water and wine, for sure.","hansavijaticar","Dec 29, 2014"

The aroma is funky, earthy, musty, a bit straw like.  The flavor is nice with some tartness, wheat, straw, hops and lemon peel.  Slightly savory but in no way salty or brine influenced.  This beer is perfect for what it is, it has balance, hops, grain and a bit of that sour that beer loves seek.  A lovely beer and perfection to style.

4.09,1.7,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours a dark, hazy gold with a fizzy, white, soda-pop head that quickly fizzles away. In body the beer is dark, yet translucent, showing murky, cloudy hints of the other side of the glass, along with a healthy torrent of bubbles. No particles can be seen in the beer. On the nose, the beer smells lightly tart and wheaty, like a wheat flake and a subdued Berliner Weisse. Light saline notes also puff upon the tongue, though I don’t think I would detect them if I didn’t know this was a gose. Lemon citrus is light, yet bright on the nose, giving a nice pop and inviting you to drink the beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially tart, nearly puckering, but this mellows into a soft, bready sweetness with just a touch of saltiness, and a deeper earthy sense to suggest that this is a gose. In flavor, the beer begins as sharp lemon-lime citrus, which mellows into sweet lemon, then lemon bread, and then slowly works into a soft, fluffy, wheat flake flavor that finishes soft and comforting on the tongue for a decent amount of time. In the middle of the taste, the earthy and mineral flavors can be distinctly sensed as the lemon citrus dies down. The aftertaste is soft, but distinctly flavored with wheat malt notes. In the mouth, the beer feels fizzy, yet light in body. The carbonation is at soda-levels, with a slightly sharp effervescence that snaps upon the tongue and gives the beer a crispness. The mouth is left wet with acid-canceling saliva on the cheeks and a very soft chalkiness. Overall, this beer is hugely refreshing and very tasty. It’s not quite as salty as I was hoping it would be, but it’s the first old-world gose I’ve tried, so I blame new world interpretations for making me expect big salt. The beer is soft, yet nuanced, like a well-crafted ginger ale with alcohol and deeper citrus flavors. It’s crisp, refreshing, and perfect to slake your thirst in summer. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Sep 02, 2013"

I think I would like this best as a summer beer. there is so much going on here between the salt and the sour, crank up the alcohol and itd be more like a cocktail than a beer, but its very inventive, and apparently quite traditional at the same time. id recommend this only to the adventurous beer drinker.","StonedTrippin","Mar 03, 2013"

3.88,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Beer is medium-light to light bodied, with medium to high levels of carbonation for the heft. This makes the beer quite propulsive on the palate, slightly prickly, but generally a fast sipper. The salt adds to the drying effect of the beer itself, making this quite dry, with a bit of stickiness on the mouth after each sip.","falloutsnow","Jun 22, 2012"

Nice lemon peel and a bit of spice (coriander?) to it. Some sweet malt aroma, too. The flavor is a nice mix of sweet and tart with lemon peel and lactic acidity. A subtle salt and spice flavor is present. Really just light and easy to drink.","womencantsail","Jan 15, 2012"

Tastes really good, I think a mix between Berliner Weisse and a hefeweizen - a little bit sourish with woody notes, but also fruity like lemon and apricot. Very refreshing.

4.6,14.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Overall: What an amazing beer. I had tried the Bayerischer Bahnhof Gose on tap in the States, and this put B-Bahnhof to shame. The lactic acid is assertive but not as dominating as it is in a Berliner Weisse. I suppose it can't be if you want the coriander and salt contributions to come through. And while the salt gave it an earthy quality, it never becomes savory. The salt complements the sweetness of the wheat malt and coriander in the same way that you add salt to cookies and other sweets. Overall there are some unique flavors here that all come together to make something unexpected and remarkable. While B-Bahnhof plays it safe, Doellnitzer/Ohne Bedenken goes all the way to make an incredible beer. If you are anywhere near Leipzig you HAVE to stop by Ohne Bedenken or pick up a bottle in a local liquor store/supermarket.","Windigstadt","Nov 15, 2007"

Lemon sour towards the back end, with a remarkably crisp and bright finish. Rather astonishing.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 21, 2007"

3.75,-6.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Hazy yellow grassy color with a thin white head that recedes quickly. Aroma of buttery corn and yeast. Flavor is initially yeasty, but not overpowering. Flavor evolves to corny malt and finishes crisp with zesty lemon and some spice, sorta peppery. Some spicy lemon lingers. Relatively low drinkability due to the yeast/lemon combo that was a bit much for my pallete.","far333","Nov 16, 2005"

3.97,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Finally found this beer, and got a bonus of it being on sale as "no one wants to drink that crap" Well i dont know why as I didnt find anything wrong with it. It pours maybe a shade or two darker than a normal hefe, but not as dark as a dunkle. Not too much head on this one, might be due to the salt. Smell is also reminicent of a hefe with an added spicy element. Taste is smooth at first with the banana and clove esters usually associated with German wheat beers. However at the end the salt is slightly noticable and drys the beer out in the mouth. I had been told that this beer tasted like licking a salt lick, that is not the case. Carbonation is nice, and this one goes down pretty smoothly. Not sure if i would drink a lot of these in an evening, but one or two with dinner would be fine. I will definately give this a shot again","TinusTime","Apr 03, 2004"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Surprisingly hoppy smell. Hazy gold with a nice creamy head. Very visibly carbonated with the carbonation lending a tang to the flavor. Almost takes like a belgian triple, but certainly closer to belgian in flavor than any other german beer. Cloves and banana came through along with a nice malt sweetness. Definitely worth checking out if you can find it.","jreitman","Jul 12, 2003"
