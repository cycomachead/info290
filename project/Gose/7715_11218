4.36,8.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"16.9 oz bottle, pours straw gold w/ slight haze. 1/2 inch head fades, nice lacing on glass. Active carbonation. Smell is wheat, funk, coriander, & citrus. Taste is salt, coriander and citrus, fades to malt and white grape. Clean and very balanced. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and effervescent with a dry finish. Very refreshing. If you've gotten on the gose train try it-very nice without being over the top.","AppaZappa","Mar 17, 2015"

3.61,-10.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"I have had only a few examples of the style so I figured today would be a good day to revisit it while getting the grill out for the first time this year.Pours into a cylinder a hazed orange tinged light golden with a nice looking white head atop.Toasted grain and slightly metallic in the nose along with some lemon zest.A healthy dose of lemon/lactic brings some sourness to the palate,with me not being a fan of anything very sour it kinda turned me off a little,toasted grain and the hint of salt/brine in the finish.I know the gose is becoming a fashionable style right now but it's not my thing,this is a good example though and I tried to rate accordingly.","oberon","Mar 09, 2015"

4.31,7.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall: I can see why this is one of the beers generally recommended as a staple example of the style. This is a nice, well-executed gose, not too overdone on the salt or sour aspects, with a pleasant depth of character. Will repeat.","UrbanCaveman","Feb 14, 2015"

3.97,-1.2,4,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet wheat and light citric tartness, a hint of coriander. Flavor is light wheat, citrus, mild lactic tartness, hint of coriander and salt; interesting light lemon tartness in the finish at the edges of the tongue. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. A really nice example of the style, with all flavors handled lightly, but nicely balanced. The tartness is well supported by the wheat body. Both coriander and salt are deftly integrated. I'm not a sour beer fan, but found this nicely made, lightly tart beer to be refreshing and tasty.","LiquidAmber",
