Not much lacing, but probably due to the "glassware". Aroma is very nice: citrus, floral, and grassy hops jump out followed by a slight malt sweetness, mango, and tropical fruit. Taste is a muted version of the aroma. Good hop bitterness, light sweetness - just faded. Not an old bottle by any stretch - less than 30 days post-bottling, well inside the recommended 90 day window. Light-medium body, crisp but thin, thin, thin texture, moderate carbonation, dry, bitter finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 27, 2015"

The taste followed albiet a hair more bitter then I was expecting. If it was just a *bit* more balanced (less bitter) it could be as good as Lawson's Sip of Sunshine. It was bright, sunny, citrusy with a dry finish that wants to be followed with more. It says 6% but it packed a pretty good punch, too...perhaps because it goes down so easily.

Taste has lots of complexies, smooth green fruits, citrus, and florals with pine and earthy undertones. Carbonation felt on the low side but it really helped the hops come through.

Smooth, slightly grainy with something akin to crackers for a dryness that passes the tongue on each sip. Flavors are bitter yet juicy hops and there are some tropical fruits and a touch of sugary sweetness but for most part this is a hoppy, dry beer.","clayrock81","May 14, 2014"

A light gold color with a thin head yet the smell was fantastic with hop and citrus notes in the nose. The taste was even better with well defined notes of hop through out with great flavors of lemon peel, banana, and I tasted notes of elderberry although those I was with said they didn't agree. One of my favorite kinds of beer, simple yet excellently crafted. It was a little thin for me but I thought this beer was great and would definitely recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Apr 21, 2014"

4.31,0.2,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"A very recent arrival to mercurial Calgary in April, four beers from this Maine brewery have appeared in my fridge thanks to a heads-up from my favorite neighborhood beer dealer wordemupg. Cheers brother. This is only round one and frankly things might have already plateaued based on how f'ing tasty this pale ale is. A somewhat cloudy yellow with orange and red tints, featuring a lively pour with a soapy white head managing to fill much of my shaker pint glass. Phenomenal head retention, stuff sits there like a milkshake. Aroma is sweet, fruity, and redolent with a hoppy spice. I get lychee and white grape, mango, orange, faint pineapple, kind of a gummy worms effect presumably from the crystal malts. An absolutely masterpiece on the palate, with uber-clean yeast, pine, grapefruit rind, peaches, and some weedy and catty notes all in a well-integrated interplay. Bitter but very clean, faint onion and pepper apparent from the IPA-level hopping regime but with nothing sticking out in an unpleasant fashion. Toasty caramel malts provide the backbone and the finish is leafy and a tad woody, with more citrus rind and tropical ghost notes lingering until the end. This could be the best American pale ale I've had to date, a hop-centric brew but with sublime malt balance and nary a flaw to be found.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 19, 2014"

Taste is slightly hop forward and heavy on the citrus, but mellow and refreshing enough to remind you that this isn't an IPA. My new favorite pale ale, and it isn't close.","tclipse","Apr 18, 2014"

The nose is heavenly, loads of tropical notes, mango flesh, peach, and pineapple. This is backed by some pine and resin as well as mild malty notes. The taste is hop forward with moderate bitterness and an emphasis on tropical fruits. There is not much body or malt backbone, which works to make this brew light, refreshing, and full of flavor!

4.34,0.9,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma, and following flavor. The nose, right from the start, gave freshness and cleanliness that is hard to come by. Although the taste rushes in rather abruptly, it too gave a spice and ease of sip that followed rather well. This is the last of the Maine Beer Company “heavy hitters” for us to sample, and it was certainly no disappointment. Compared to Lunch and Zoe, however, we did find this guy to sip back a bit easier, and flow a touch lighter. While this can be attributable to stylistic differences, it detracts nothing from the overall sentiment of flavor and forward punch this beer has to offer. This is a fantastic beer, and one of their best, most consistently drinkable to date.","TheBrewo","Feb 14, 2014"

4.21,-2.1,3.75,4.5,4.25,4,4,"Pours a large frothy head cresting around three fingers of eggshell white foam, very whipped up and airy, lots of dimpling across the surface, the retention is so-so, the lacing is comprised of a few razor thin but very long streaks. The liquid is a pleasing light orange with a mild metallic sheen, quite clear and pretty, slight yellowing at the rims, plenty of fat bubbles, no beads, all randomly dispersed. The nose has a certain purity to it, milled grains, sour mixed white citrus, spoonful of honey, pine cone, not very sappy, minimal herbaceousness, soft cocoa maltiness, needs to warm to really release the peach, yellow apple, apricot fruit scents. Full-bodied, in fact a little too broad shouldered as it tends to progress slowly through the palate. Here it’s much more floral and the white to pink grapefruit and orange citrus a bigger overall element. The fluffy carbonation helps relieve some weight and create lift and mouth perfume. The sweetness of the apricot, peach, pear fruit takes hold with force. Some peppery notes but the graininess lost a bit. Otherwise, does a good job of masking the total sweetness and making it a blended experience versus bunch of soloists jockeying for position.","farrago","Feb 05, 2014"

The Maine Beer stuff was this old everywhere I went in MD while visiting so I figured I would take a chance anyway. Pours a slightly hazy apricot color with a massive fluffy white head on top. Aroma of zesty, earthy hops alongside some citrus and a big sweet toffee/caramel malt bill. Just smelling this I have to assume it isn’t fresh enough to enjoy as intended so I’ll tick for now and rerate another time with a fresh one. Flavor begins with some light grass, a good bit of lemon zest, grapefruit, and ending with some sweet toffee. Even with this age the beer is light and zesty on the palate. I will have to try this fresh because it must be glorious. Hops are a bit on the stale side and the malt bill is taking over a bit. Goes down easy with medium high carbonation. Nicely crafted beer. Now someone trade me a fresh one.","BMMillsy","Jan 04, 2014"

4.38,1.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled on 10/22/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden orange color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the entire glass. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, floral, grass, light honey, light caramel, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with huge hop complexity and a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big pineapple, tangerine, orange peel, peach, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, light honey, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Good amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, orange peel, lemon zest, floral grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright juicy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic pale ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of bright hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 01, 2013"

My best friend has a great trading partner who lives in Maine, so I've had a few Maine Bee Co brews and they have all been SOLID. I love clear date stamping on the bottle and the additional recommendation of number of days to best enough the beer by. Purchased on 11/2, bot said drink within 32-days of 10/22. Everything is correct with this pale ale. Love the flavors of citrus and pine, with the additional notes of spice and/or herbal and/or floral. The 6% abv is perfect and in the right portion with a 17-oz bottle. And it's a clean and refreshing beer to drink. I know this statement might be challenging, but I had a fresh Pliny the Elder a week ago, and I think the brews from Maine BC are on par with the WC powerhouse.","2BDChicago","Nov 16, 2013"

Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of more citrus fruits up front like grapefruit and orange. Then beneath that there are some tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, as well as a tiny hint of pine and floral. The malt imparts a sweet breadiness note that makes the fruit aromas seem more juicier. Taste is outstanding. Reminds me of a Hill Farmstead beer. Starts with hefty doses of bitter grapefruit and orange notes. The the middle brings a crackery, bready, sweet malt presence that balances quite nice with the increasing bitter, yet juicy grapefruit. Also starting to get tropical fruit notes as well. The finish brings more juicy tropical fruit notes like pineapple. Also getting more juicy grapefruit and a good amount of pine. Definitely detect the red wheat on the finish as well. Getting almost like a bubblegum flavor. Bitter, but not as aggressive as you might expect. In-your-face, yet delicate from the balance of malt and hops, as well as the clean finish. Medium body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfect, as it refreshes the beer and cleanses the palate, which makes you want to take another sip. I’ve had a lot of amazing pale ales, and this one is right up there with those. Glad they are in Chicago now.","brewskis","Nov 02, 2013"

Hop forward and refreshing. Light in body with moderate carbonation. Big floral and citrus notes. Oranges and lemons with a touch of bitter pine, finishing dry. A wonderful pale ale. My only complaint is that it's $6.99 per 500 mL bottle, when a beer of this ilk should be $9-12 per sixer.

I also detect some qualities that I cant quite put my finger on that are usually common in DIPAs. And at only 6% and easily sessionable, I'm in heaven. Regardless of ABV, this is a gem. Anything above 93 rating on BA usually is. Do try it if you have a chance. As I'm finishing this glass a waitress brought another beer along the same style to sample. I can already tell this is going to be a bumpy ride.","DavidBart","Sep 09, 2013"
4.3,0,4,4,4,5,5,"Thick rich body for a pale ale. Good carbonation, a little sticky but the medium plays it down a bit in a good way for balance. Citrus peels with a faint touch of tobacco. Earthy meets bright citrus fruits with a solid sweet malt backbone throughout. Simple and subtle yet packed with flavor, slowly building bitterness but balanced by a lingering malt sweetness, quite the pale ale. But like everything else Maine, it's just a tease, a beer is rather have in a 6. I'd even pay stone 4 pack prices for their stuff.","jtierney89","Sep 09, 2013"

I love the intensity of it, while staying not too bitter. jazzy carbonation, clean finish and feel, as good as any American pale on the market I think. the lightness is what impresses me most. I could drink this forever, and my 10 ounce pour just isn't enough! all beers on at maine beer company were tasty, great examples of their respective styles, but this to me was the pick of the litter. already looking forward to my next one, whenever I may be so lucky. a true gem.","StonedTrippin","Aug 18, 2013"

It has a nice nose: a lot is going on there. Get some apricot, spices, pine notes as the main players. The taste is very good. Just a hint of the apricot, and a bit of bitterness.

The smell is not even close to over powering, but it's nice; just a light, citrusy hop smell; classic american pale ale. The taste is nice too, but the citrusy side of the hops is muted a bit and instead you get more bitterness that I would expect in a beer of this style. Still, it's a great tasting beer. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but fine. All in all, a very nice apa. It actually reminds me of Founders All Day, but it's more bitter, has less hop aroma and taste, and it costs about 3 times as much. That's why, even though I'd be happy to drink this beer again, I probably won't.","dougfur","Jun 25, 2013"

Taste is also dominated by some citrus notes with some floral hoppy notes and some citrus notes with lightly sweet non-descript malt base. Body is about average with good carbonation. I really like the take on this one with nice floral aroma notes and limited bitterness.","Phyl21ca","May 26, 2013"

This stay smooth and creamy looking, leaving back a robust smattering of lacing behind. Smells fresh and floral with a little dankness and pine mixed in. Lot of juicy tropical fruit notes. Taste has a zesty grapefruit bitterness with a resinous finish. Sticky notes of fruit, herbal flavors and neutral malt sweetness do a tremendous job of balancing and adding extra flavor to this. The mouthfeel is medium with a firm and sharp feel in the mouth which is undercut by just the right amount of creaminess. This was really nice. An APA with a good bit of aggressive to it yet was still extremely well balanced, with those tropical passion fruit flavors in particular really standing out. Well worth checking out.","Kegatron","Apr 23, 2013"

This bottle is definitely unfiltered and bottle-conditioned. Scent is...WOW! Blown away by this aroma...very reminiscent of the hoppy beers I'm familiar with in Santa Rosa. Awesome tropical aromas... I actually pick up mangos in this one, along with grapefruit, honeydew, pineapple, and orange peel. Not an ounce of maltiness. Does the east side know what they're doing now??? Taste is just as great. By far, one of the most flavorful and tasty Pale Ales...in the same family as Daisy Cutter, Row 2, Hoppy Birthday, Zombie Dust, and Happy Hops. The flavors are spot on from the nose. No overwhelming maltiness. Amazing hop flavors with the right amount of citrus, pine, and bitterness. I love when such a sessionable beer packs such a flavor punch. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with a crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is crazy high. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. This is my first beer from this brewery, but I'm onto them. They're smart. They realize the success of Russian River, and they're using them as a model. Simple labels, 500ml bottles, emphasize the "drink now" aspect, and make the beer taste DAMN GOOD. Much respect for Maine Beer Company. I can't wait to try more beers from them, and will definitely be seeking this stuff out.","DovaliHops","Dec 19, 2012"

The flavor is light bread, cracker and a hint of seltzer water with a nice pine and grapefruit flavor going on. There's a solid shot of bitterness in this one, I'm guessing because the body is a bit light to stand up to the massive hopping here.

There is a fair amount of dry hopping with Amarillo, Centennial, and Simcoe I would guess by the bright nose and flavor. Great job Maine Beer.

On the palate, tropical fruits (pineapple, papaya, and mango) make a run early, before a sweeping rush of biscuity malt and soft earth. The finish is mildly bitter and lightly sweet from the tropical fruits. This is a nice APA. Well-balanced.

3.99,-7.2,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, bright, crystal clear yellow-gold coloring with a thin, sparse, bright white filmy coating on the surface. Aromas of resiny, bitter, pungent green hops with piney overtones. Smells delicious! Flavors are heavily roasted, with a bitter overtone that is undercut by a citrus and bready backbone. Both lemon zest and buttery biscuit support the heavy dose of hops character, that quickly gives way to an effervescent, light, crisp aftertaste. The flavors are so huge initially that it almost seems like it disappears on the backend. Clean, crisp finish makes this beer an incredibly easy drinker. Nicely put together, but a little abrupt on the ending.","GarthDanielson","Sep 07, 2012"
3.94,-8.4,4,5,3.5,3,4,"The beer pours a pale straw yellow color with a nice big creamy head that pusses down to a rocky finger’s width, leaving slight spots and clouds of sticky lacing. The beer is hazy and torrential with bubbles of carbonation racing up from the bottom of the glass. This beer smells fat and juicy. It is drizzling with citrus, mango, pine, and slight pineapple. There is a great buttery biscuit smell lying below the fruity hops and giving the beer a great body. This smell is very enticing. The beer tastes like a mellower version of the smell, but it’s a little disappointing. The initial sip dances with some of those wonderful hops but rushes away quickly and is replaced by vegetal bitters. The taste overall is bitter and average. There is a great bitter taste at the middle with a little stale biscuit taste that lasts in the mouth and reminds me of a bitter earthy hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and velvety, sitting quite nicely on the tongue and leaving the mouth with a nice skim of saliva and a little dry. The only problem is the earthy, almost vegetal bitter aftertaste that tingles through the mouth. Overall this is a pretty good APA that is hurt by its aftertaste. The smell is to die for and might be my new favorite smell, but the taste doesn’t quite follow up. This is another good offering from Maine Beer Company but my least favorite of the ones I’ve tried; to be fair I must admit that APA’s are not my favorite. This beer is definitely worth a try and smell and continues the excellence that this nano-brewery has developed.","Maxwell","Sep 07, 2012"

Perfect, true to the style, hoppy pale ale. Nice range of hop flavors. Bursts of grapefruit, orange... nice lemongrass kick. Really mild pine notes and a nice sweet malt.

There's both solid head retention and lacing. The nose is of dank, bitter grapefruit peel, an aroma a typically associate with Centennial hops. The flavor displays a brief bit of bready malts at the open, before a very snappy bitterness comes along. The close tastes of grapefruit peel, but also the pith, which ends up giving the beer a slightly unpleasant close. The body is a tad chewy, and the carbonation dull, but both are super close to being right on the money. MO is right at the upper end of the APA category, trending towards an IPA, and it's just an alright version of the style. I definitely prefer Peeper from MBC.","axeman9182","Jul 23, 2012"

4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Right off the bat, another solid Maine Beer Company beer. These guys know what the fuck they're doing Pours a brilliant, transparent gold hue with a nice two finger head with some decent lacing. The smell has a very lovely hop aroma with some stellar citrus and pine. The taste is just sublime. Seriously...MBC knows what it's doing. Excellent balance of all components across the board. The mouthfeel too is slick as hell. This could EASILY be a go to beer for me. I can't wait to see what else these guys have going on. This may be better than both Lunch AND Zoe, to me. Incredible.","Retail1LO","Mar 17, 2012"
4.39,2.1,4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"This is an excellent beer. With the amount of hops and 6% ABV this is borderline IPA territory. I suppose it's whatever the brewer calls it but if I had it blind I'd call it an IPA. Either way it's a great example of a clean, hoppy beer that could be a mess if it wasn't done properly.","ms11781","Mar 16, 2012"

4.03,-6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Always excited to try anything new from the guys at MBC. This one pours a very vibrant gold, very clear, huge rocky head. Lively, and screaming fresh. Very hoppy in the nose, lots of green pine, some citrus, herb-y. Flavor is indeed very hoppy but this beer remains balanced. Lots of bright hops, herbal and grassy and pine again, woodsy, light doughy malts, and a definite crispness. This beer is super light on the palate for having so much flavor. Very airy and quaffable. Definitely along the same lines as Peeper and Lunch but a testament the brewery that they can pull off such a variety of hoppy light colored beers that all have their own identity. Curious to see if this makes it into the regular rotation or is just a seasonal / one-off. Always a delicious, fresh, well made beer from Maine","twelvsies","Mar 01, 2012"
