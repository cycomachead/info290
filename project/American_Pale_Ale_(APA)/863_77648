The first time I tried it I didn't know the ABV and guessed that it was around 7%, not because you could taste alcohol, but because there was so much flavor.  Hop forward with plenty of citrus, missing some of the pineyness that I expect from west coast ales and substituting tropical and earth notes, riding a sufficient and perfectly complimentary malt backbone.  I find single hop beers to have more personality than usual, and not always in a good way,  but here  RR nails it.  I've almost stopped drinking pale ales because they are less interesting to me than IPAs, but this is one I sorely wish was available locally.","Gastone","Oct 31, 2014"

Not much aroma, which was unexpected. smell of light pine and a hint of citrus peel backed by some very lightly sweet malts. Simcoe grapefruit flavor dominates alongside some piney medium bitter on the tongue. Resinous yet dry finishing pine, medium plus carbonation, and super easy drinking. A really nice beer, but one that I was expecting more from. I will have to try and revisit this one.","BMMillsy","Mar 01, 2014"

Awesome lacing and retention. Aroma is very pine and grapefruit forward with just a touch of crackery malts. Bitter grapefruit leads into resinous pine and smooth bready malts. Falls a bit flat towards the end but then again it is a pale and not an IPA. Very tasty and refreshing. Mouth feel is coating and sticky. This is just a solid, no frills pale ale.

Poured a nice golden yellow with slight orange hue with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit, grapefruit hop, fruit, and very subtle pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, tropical fruit, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, fruit, and subtle grapefruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really intrigued by this one upon seeing its release from the brewery. I know RR is good at making IPA/IIPAs so I wanted to see what they could do with an APA. I can honestly say that they did quite a nice job on this one. The simcoe is a very nice hop and this brew definitely showcases this fact throughout each sip and especially in the aroma. This brew also brings a very nice balance of flavor and aroma with it as well to keep your palate intrigued throughout. Up there as one of the best APAs I’ve had, but not quite up to Zombie Dust standards as I would have LOVED to find.","thagr81us","0"

The flavors too are hoppy, clean, and floral. There is also a perfumey essence. I love how straightforward it is. Simcoe isn't my favorite hop varietal but that doesn't phase me from cherishing this beer. It would be fun to see what other hop varietals could do with this recipe. It drinks light and is very smooth. Overall this is a great pale. I would place it behind Zombie Dust and the Hill Farmsteads but that already puts it in an elite class.","aasher","Jul 30, 2012"

A delicious APA, much needed here on the west coast in a sea of sameness with this style beer. Very drinkable and almost sessionable at 5.8 abv. It's not Zombie Dust, but it's a serious APA for all of you that seek out quality in this style.","OTB","Jul 13, 2012"

Taste mirrors nose, more fruity than malty until the pine notes set in on the back end, increasingly so as it warmed. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, good effervescence.

It's a mouth-watering mix of bright citrus, tangerine, lemon, some tropical fruit (pineapple/mango) and light spruce/pine. Just wonderful. Some light sugary caramel malt peeks through the hops. The beer is dry and light on the palate. There's a gentle caramel backbone with definite but light bitterness. It's very easy to drink. I keep using the word light but it's a very flavorful lightness. For my palate, it's perfectly balanced and as good of a session-ish IPA (not really sure what to call these APAs that are dry and hopped up like IPAs/DIPAs) as I've had. The finish is crisp with more marvelous floral hop character. It's an excellent beer. I still remember liking Hopfather a touch more, so I'll stick with 4.5s, but this is an absolutely worthy edition to RR's APA/IPA/DIPA lineup.","popery","Apr 24, 2012"

Taste is just as good... probably the most user-friendly pale ale they offer (from ones that I've had). Not as flavorful as the nose would seem to imply, but so much complexity to make this beer as light as it is...it's ridiculous.

The scent of oranges mingled with pine resin fills the air as I pour. This smells more like an IPA than a Pale Ale, and I must say that it smells great. Taste opens with huge citrus flavors. Orange, tangerine and mango intermingle with hoppy bitterness. A sugar cookie malt backbone imparts a bit of sweetness which plays nicely against the hops. The beer finishes semi-dry with a very subtle aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. This brew is yet another masterpiece from Russian River. The malt melds seamlessly with the hop profile providing an incredibly balanced brew. Fruity, piney, and mildly bitter, the beer is insanely drinkable and very tasty. Well done Mr. Cilurzo.

The taste follows the nose, with pine, grapefruit, and a dankness. Just a enough malt comes through to balance it with a little bit of caramel and sugar cookie.
