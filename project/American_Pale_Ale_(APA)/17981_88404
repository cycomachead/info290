Taste is very hoppy, closer to a IPA style. Not bad, just not what I was expecting. Pronounced pine and hop notes at the beginning, fading to a very watery lemon taste. Mouth feel is very little carbonation with a very oily feeling. Not very good. Overall, a little disappointed based on the BA Score.","TBCE","Apr 05, 2015"

Taste is strong orange, then pine, sweet caramel, little spicy, medium bitterness, dry almost watery finish, and a lemon pith finished flavor.

Aroma is very tropical, lots of pineapple, mango and some toasted malt aromas. Flavor is much of the same, tropical fruity hop flavors with a solid toasty malt backbone. Carbonation is a bit off, as noticed by the huge head. Somewhat fizzy and just slightly off.

4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 10/9/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright golden color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light steaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange zest, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent pale ale. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

As CC never disappoints I secured a sixer myself and headed towards the door. Now back at the ranch, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top on the can I get a nice piney-citrus hop waft. Pouring into a chalice I get a translucent orange with a multi-sized bubble off-white head that stands well. On the taste this brew is a well balanced PA that hits up front with some bitterness, fades to sweet maltiness then finishes with a dry and bitter aftertaste. Very refreshing and a wide range of flavors for a PA, complex if I may say so. This is yet another keeper from CC","mooseisloose","Aug 07, 2014"

Smell is of malt, earth, citrus zest, and slight tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, earth, and slight tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I am getting more earthy aspects than tropical ones like the label describes.","UCLABrewN84","0"
3.45,-12,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured into a cheap hotel-room glass. Still has a nice thick head though. Pale yellow in color, transparent. Smells of grass, lemon zest, and grain. The taste is light and crisp. A good amount of hop bitterness for a pale ale. The hop flavor is earthy with a slight citrus aftertaste. Grassy finish. Light-bodied and refreshing and but not too thin; good consistency. I tried hard not to compare this to Jai Alai. It's definitely not Jai Alai light. It stands on its own as a solid, drinkable pale ale.","mattsdenney","May 22, 2014"

4.05,3.3,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, pale, golden coloring with some suspended proteins and a frothy, chunky, fluffy, off-white head that slowly settles out into a sparse surface coating. Aromas of citrus and melon hops forward, with a pungent bitterness and some subtle spicing. Smells big. Flavors are spice forward, with pepper and pine tassel blending well with the quickly following citrus and tropical fruit notes. Remains light throughout, despite the heavier characteristics, and you start to get a heavier roast quality towards the end of the palate, which highlights the tropical notes. Light, effervesced body keeps the beer moving all over your taste buds. A sweet and spiced blend of pineapple and melon in the aftertaste, with a quick, roasted lingering finish. Easy drinker, and this would be a great hot summer beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 01, 2014"
