Aromas are of toffee, caramel, earth, really light citrus and a touch vegetal.  Aromas are very muddled and really needed to be focused on to pull out.  Taste follows with some nice toffee and burnt caramel notes, a touch of citrus mid palate gives way to an earthy and vegetal note in the finish that I assume is from the sweet potato.  Not overly bitter and very drinkable.  Medium body with lower carbonation and a really nice creamy feel that coats the palate well.  I can't say I was over the top with this but I found it enjoyable all the same.","HopBomb515","Jan 13, 2015"

The beer gave off a nice, sweet malty aroma, but it was tough to distinguish any distinct part. The flavor of the beer was good, malty, but like the taste, nothing too distinctive. The beer; however, was nice and creamy and had a good fell to it with a nice mild, but slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, a slightly better than average beer.","PhillyStyle","Oct 30, 2014"

A hint of milk chocolate and brown sugar as well...  Very pleasant aroma all the way around...  The flavor is rich and robust but a significant deviation from the aroma...  Roasted malt, coffee and peat materialize after not being detected on the nose...  There is actually a fairly potent hop bite, especially by style standards...  The end result is a highly complex and highly enjoyable flavor profile...  The mouthfeel is a tad bit thin and on the lighter side of medium bodied...  Crisp with some prickly carbonation...

3.65,1.4,,,,,,"The beer pours a bubbly slightly tannish head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a clear and brown copper. The beer smell has strong sweet and caramel notes with a bit of the sweet potato. The sweet potato is fairly distinct from the other notes. The hops are barely noticeable but give off a floral aroma. The taste has the same notes but at different strengths. The hops are slightly stronger and the sweet potato is more noticeable and stands apart from the rest of the beer. The malt and caramel notes are not as strong as they were in the smell and are covered by the sweet potato. The change is not bad but could have been better incorporated even though it still works. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy bodied and thick but light enough to be smooth with the biting carbonation. Overall, a decent beer and okay.","HattedClassic","Sep 16, 2014"

There is an earthy gourd like flavor but I struggle to find it. Instead it's just a nice smooth malt like barley grain, tea leaf and burnt toast. Some fruity hops, lemon I think, along with a bit of pine compliment the malt.

Flavor is sweet caramel malts, some other interestingly sweet notes that I assume comes from the sweet potatoes, the same characteristic yeast or water or something that I get from every SN beer, black cherries, bitter straw to balance. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly resinous with a dry finish. This was interesting, sort of like a light bodied old ale. Lots of flavor very dominated by the malts.

The appearance is almost on the next level, the smell is very solid but not outstanding, and the flavor is absolutely on par and hitting all the right notes, but nothing in particular sets it apart. That said, it all comes together to make an exceptionally well-integrated beer for the style, smoothly incorporating the sweet potato (which I’m guessing is actually just a yam, but that’s another conversation entirely and immaterial to the subject at hand). Very good stuff.","fmccormi","Sep 11, 2014"
3.05,-15.3,,,,,,"Overall I don't get much from the sweet potatoes but I wonder if the abundance of sugars in them might have boosted the alcohol without any buffer. I don't want to say it is alcoholic but for 7% it does have a bit of a harsh edge when this combines with the somewhat medicinal fruit flavors (which grow with each sip). I appreciate the malt flavors here and they are the best part of the beer (along with the aroma) to me but it just doesn't end up sitting well on the palate towards the end.","cbutova","Sep 11, 2014"

I get a decent amount of caramel, toffee, and what I think is sweet potato at the very end. I wouldn't know what that smell was if they didn't advertise it. Pretty typical for a scotch ale but a bit subdued. The flavor is very mild and not nearly as sweet as I expected from the nose. I get some toasty notes at the finish that are preceded some mild fruityness and toffee. I don't think the sweet potato comes through at all. The finish is fairly dry with a low bitterness. Medium body with a low carbonation. Overall, I am not a fan of the style and I think the use of the sweet potato was a general miss.","PSU_Mike","Sep 04, 2014"

Taste like a mix between a pale ale and a Scottish ale.  Has a carmel malty taste and once it starts warming up I start tasting the sweet potato.

3.73,3.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a dark, hazy mahogany brown with a half finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, an earthy, sweet smell that does resemble sweet potato, hints of vanilla and peat. Flavor is interesting earthy malt, mild toasted malt, sweet potato, coffee; finishes with light grassy hops and mild biscuit malt with a faint peat component. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A rather subdued Scottish ale, with light malt flavors, little smokiness. Redeemed by the interesting sweet potato taste, this would have been kind of boring without that novelty. A pleasant enough mild Scottish ale that could have used some more intense character. One of the beers from the pack I was looking forward to, but it's not my favorite.","LiquidAmber","Aug 13, 2014"

I was hoping for a better beer and because it was a collaboration from my home region I will probably give it more than it deserves, but it was an average beer at best. Truthfully, Old Chub is a better representation of the style and I much prefer the new NITRO version of that over this. It was worth giving a try but it was about as I expected. Not much. I will say that I was not expecting the amount of hop bitterness going on in this beer. Not that it really has any hops in it to speak of, but it was more bitter than I was expecting which gave it more balance than most in the style.","humuloner22","Aug 05, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, brown bread, herbal, grass, light roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and unique scottish ale. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink.

The beer was a crystal clear, ruby-blood coloring with a dense, frothy, clingy, cream colored head. Nose of rich caramel, earthy notes, and subtle floral highlights. Favors are earthy and sweet forward, with scotch notes, caramel candy, sugar, thistle, and subtle bitter characteristics. Smooth and mid-bodied, with a tangy, richly sweet aftertaste. Smooth finish. This beer was a nice drinker, with very decent flavors coming off of those sweet potatoes.","GarthDanielson","0"

It smells like a Belgian, super sweet with some dark fruit notes... but it lacks the malt backbone required for the style. It tastes interesting, again - like it wants to be a Belgian. I don't get sweet potato from it, but I do get sweet, like cotton candy sweet. Still, there's a lot here to be admired and I'll freely admit to an afternoon of drinking. If you get a chance, definitely try this. I'll review it again my second time round... picking up a second box tomorrow.","Mantooth","Jul 27, 2014"

Nose is very hard to detect - perhaps dark fruit and an earthy and/or medicinal quality. Taste follows nose - dark fruit is muted and flavor profile is dominated by pale malts. There's also a slight herbal/medicinal bittering towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even, consistent carbonation.

There's really not much else here, and the finish is rather dry. Not very to-style. I don't know what the sweet potatoes contribute, but I can't taste any at all.

A very interesting take on a Scottish Ale made with Sweet Potatoes from North Carolina. the appearance was dark brown with a bit of a haze and a tan foam that left nice trails down the glass. The smell was sweet but mostly malt. The taste was similar in that there was a lot of amazing malt flavors, but you could still get hints of the sweet potatoes on the end. Reminded me of Thanksgiving. Also the mouthfeel was full, but not overly thick. Really enjoyed this one and made me excited for the next eleven out of this years beer camp.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 16, 2014"

The beer is akin to a highly refined Newcastle or Honey Brown that isn't overpoweringly sweet and packs a respectable amount of ABV in the punch. If your expecting a delicious sweet potato beer, you will be disappointed. If you are of the rare few that love Scottish Ales, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one.","CraigS119","Jul 14, 2014"
