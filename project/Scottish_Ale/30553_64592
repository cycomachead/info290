4.21,12.9,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Had on tap. Has a smoky, peaty nose bordering on dirty wool socks. It pours brilliant copper amber with a thin film of a head. Presents a very clean and smooth palate with a little smoke, dark kettle sugars and lightly toasted malts. The palate is close to an American interpretation of a Scottish ale while it has the clean and smooth character of a lager. Medium body and carbonation.","pat61","Feb 27, 2015"

This is a Scotch-lover’s Scotch Ale!!  Between this and the Slingshot, I’m impressed with this brewery!  Thanks to my brother for bringing them back with him from Iowa after visiting his in-laws!","Jeffreysan","Jan 01, 2015"

3.93,5.4,3,4.25,4,3.25,4,"O: This is one of the more unique lagers I've tried, and rest assured, it is in fact a bock lager and not at all a Scottish ale. The smoke and malt play off one another quite well. I repeat this beer any time I happen to be near Iowa City (Go Hawkeyes).","UrbanCaveman","Sep 16, 2014"

4.25,13.9,,,,,,"Got this tasty brew after dinner. Had a nice copper, brown color and slightly ivory head when poured into a glass from a bottle. Not a strong aroma from the bottle, but picked up the malts. I enjoyed the bock style that tasted like it got mixed with a rauchbier. Smokey flavor and aftertaste, but not overpowering. Overall, I'm glad I spotted a poster the wall for this brewery, good local brew.","CrackedHarlot","Aug 11, 2014"

4.06,8.8,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,4,"O - From the first whiff, Wooden Nickel has an aroma unlike any other beer, even smoke, or peated beers. This blend of styles trail blazes a new path of Scottish-style German lager with the classic characteristics of each shining with equal importance. Very unique and very nicely done.","BeerFMAndy","Feb 15, 2014"

While it could use a bit more potency from all the flavors at work here, it's very easy to drink and very easy to enjoy. Worth picking up, I know I will be reaching for this one again soon.","alphagnome","Aug 28, 2013"

4.09,9.7,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"I didn't have high expectations but this is a good one. Described as a Scottish Peated Lager on the bottle and it is just that - a spectacular version of a slightly smokey Scottish ale only lagered. With the fruitiness of the ale yeast gone, the malts really shine. I may have found my new go-to fall/winter beer. Great stuff.","knepper","Oct 04, 2012"
