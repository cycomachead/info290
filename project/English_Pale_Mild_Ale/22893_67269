3.4,-2.6,3.75,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The Mid Mountain Mile Ale is just that a mild tasty beer that would be perfect with....everything! The Chicken Man who is eventually moving to the land of Utah provided this morsel. The beer poured a hazy copper with foamy head that is leaving a lace. The scent is very faint almost non-descript. The taste is very well balanced between malt and bittering hops. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer that is very sessionable.","WoodBrew","Jun 23, 2014"

The mouthfeel is probably the highpoint since the smell and taste are somewhat uninspiring. Criticisms aside, there would be nothing wrong with sharing a few pints of this with friends at a bar.","spoony","Jun 13, 2014"

3.54,1.4,3.25,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy orange with white head and lots of lacing. Nose starts with some dry malts followed by some biscuity character. Some mild hops round it out at the end. Taste is malt forward with very mild flavors. The base grain come through strong with light notes of sweetness which is cut by dry biscuit notes. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, this is an easy drinking brew. Not sure how this is a mild though.","homebrew311","Nov 13, 2013"

3.58,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"A respectable mild malt beverage. This probably won't appeal to any IPA hop heads, but, then, this isn't the style. Relatively light in character overall but with a pleasing toasted grain and nut character that proves quite satisfying to the taste buds.","beergoot","Sep 27, 2013"
3.67,5.2,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"aside from the obvious question of how a mild makes the exponential series, this is a pretty good brew. its not what I expected though, and English mild, this is decidedly American. darker in color too, caramel, medium spectrum, heady and well carbonated. it has more than just light grain, and I appreciate immediately its diversity. there is a touch of smoke, some darker toast, and the delicacy of white wheat, all in great balance. our bottle says 4.5% abv, and it certainly doesn't seem any more than that, very drinkable and soft. not as interesting as some, but the plethora of grains makes it not boring. not sure I could session this long enough to catch a buzz, but I like its richness for the abv, and I like how smooth it finishes, flavorful and everything in good harmony. not a beer that's meant to wow you, epic has plenty of choices for that, but a good hearty mild as they go, and one I wouldn't be opposed to drinking again, especially at about 4 bucks a bomber, very appealing.","StonedTrippin","Jul 17, 2013"
