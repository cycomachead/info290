4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"d - I liked this one a lot. Some slight bitterness from the hops in the taste but very drinkable. Would like to have again.","mdfb79","Jun 04, 2010"
3.95,8.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice golden color with a white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose is nice and gentle with a slight hoppy character and a nice amount of backing bread. Lightly malted with a sprinkling of hops, this is nice and mellow and works really well. Some floral and herbal characteristics linger throughout. Body is pretty light with good carbonation. Nice and drinkable; this was an enjoyable brew that I'd certainly have again.","Thorpe429","Jan 08, 2010"
4.1,12.6,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Beer is thin and has a nice floral bitterness to it. There isn't as much yeast on the palate that I expected from the aroma. Beer is flavorful and really nice. A hop forward pale mild from England. I'm super impressed. I'd have this again if it were available to me. A very exciting beer in my opinion.","drabmuh","Aug 31, 2009"

4.02,10.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Note: Fairly ridiculous that this, at 4.7%, is a Pale Mild while Castle Rock Harvest, a nearly identical beer at 3.8%, is an English Bitter. Many English beers need style help on BA.","StJamesGate","Dec 11, 2008"

3.64,0,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazed pilsner-yellow with a fizzy, soapy white head that doesn't retain particularly well. Pleasantly sharp and pilsneresque in the aroma as well, bright with noble, lemony hops, white wine, faint lime and lemongrass, and even fainter honey. On the palate it is clean and crisp, perhaps a bit too light, but nice and zesty with quite citric hops - in fact this is almost like American lemonade. Quite bitter for such a light mouthfeel, and parchingly dry. I'd recommend having this one well chilled, as it's more of a refresher than anything and I don't think its flavor benefits much from a warmer serving temperature.","soulgrowl","Apr 17, 2008"
