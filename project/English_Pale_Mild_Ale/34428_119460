3.55,-8.3,4,3.25,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Pours a deep garnet, ruby color with a two finger off white head that disappates quickly.  Aroma shows sweetness with hints of caramel, toffee, and chocolate.  Taste is similar with caramel, toffee, and more chocolate.  Mouthfeel is thin with light carbonation.  Overall a good example of the style and a drinkabke, sessionable brew.","BrownAleBollocks","Oct 08, 2014"
