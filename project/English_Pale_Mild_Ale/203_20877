3.23,-4.2,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Notes: Not a bad beer but not great, and I can't really decide when I would want to drink it. Not really a session beer, or one that I would want to casually sip. Seems like it is marketed to go with food, and it probably wouldn't be bad that way, but there are beers that I would prefer over this to have with food. Not really a typical British beer, but a decent beer. Flavors just a little too bland and faint.","FreshHawk","Jun 16, 2007"

2.63,-22,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Drinkability: It is very easy to drink but the flavours are far too muted, and it gives the beer a bland taste, which is a shame. I can see why they pitched it as a dinning beer.","PartyBear","Jun 11, 2007"
4.04,19.9,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Peachy honey-gold, thick with bubbles, but not up top where it counts. Brown sugar, caramel, apples, lemon, and a very nice, mellow but robust bay leafy herbal hop character round out the aroma. The flavor is balanced and light yet spicy. I suspected that in making a "beer to dine for" Greene King was basically attempting an ale that tastes like a bland, inoffensive continental lager. I was half right. The taste is comparable to Stella or Heineken, but only in the sense that it has a similar balance of clear, bready malts and quick, zesty hops. Bland it isn't; it's flavorful, grainy, husky, and sweet, well spiced with a sort of citric-herbal hop profile, nicely accentuated by a fizzy, airy mouthfeel. Nice fruity undertones of grapes and orange as well. Very good, I think, and indeed it was good with the chicken soup and rye crisps I paired it with. Refreshing yet robust.","soulgrowl","May 26, 2007"

4.22,25.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D- I bought this beer on sale and wasn't expecting much, wow was I wrong. The Tettnang hops really add a nice character to the beer. This beer looks light but it has good flavors making this very drinkable. There is a nice flavor that reminds me of a very good Kolsch beer yet there are some nice ale qualities aswell. They say this is a beer to dine for but with food I think the subtle flavors might not hold up to spices and flavor of the food.","rhoadsrage","Sep 19, 2006"
3.57,5.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The mouth is light bodied, a little creamy, with a gentle citrus buzz, and a mild hoppy dryness on the finish. Very drinkable, and I can see it pairing well with a wide variety of foods--thus it's achieved its goal. Yet, by itself it's merely an easy drinking, unremarkable brew. Decent overall.","Osiris9588","Sep 01, 2006"
3.38,0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The Beer To Dine For is much too cutsie a name for a beer that expects to be taken seriously. I must admit, though, the name and the bottle ensure that this Greene King/Morland offering will get more than a few impulse purchases. In fact, I was one. In the end, it's a decent English pale mild that isn't quite worth the $3.99 that I paid for it.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 30, 2006"
3.1,-8,3,3,2.5,4,4,"M&D - this beer is great on its own, too light and carbonated and malty for me, but suits a nice dinner perfectly, goes well with food and that was its intention so i must review it within its intentions and the style, for which it is very good","sinstaineddemon","Aug 28, 2006"

2.97,-11.9,3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"M&D: too spritzy to be nice on the mouthfeel, and the body is very thin as well... the carbonation is simply not right, making this beer less than drinkable if consumed alone... Well, probably that's why it's meant to be a "beer to dine for", rather than something nice to drink alone?!","wl0307","Apr 26, 2006"

3,-11,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"M/D: This is on the heavy side of a light beer. This beer is very mild and non-offensive. I guess it would be good with food, but I feel that other English selections might complement the dishes discussed on the back of the bottle a little better.","jameaterblues","Nov 22, 2004"
3.68,9.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice, somewhat on the darker side golden color. Sort of low aroma-slight hop and sulfury smell. Medium hoppiness level. Tad of a bitter finish. Good mouthfeel-quite smooth and viscuous. A decent British ale. Theres a bunch of them out there-definately 1 of the more enjoyable.","lackenhauser",
