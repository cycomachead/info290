2.15,-29.3,2.5,2.5,2,2,2,"At first I thought, not really bad, but also not very traditional. Then it started downhill. First thing I noticed was the color being quite light. It did have some noticeable hops, but not much malt - very thin. Unbalanced beer. There's significant long lasting carbonic tang. Not much in the aroma department either. Now that I'm done with this review, the brew gets dumped.","drpimento","Mar 10, 2013"
2.82,-7.2,2.5,3,2.75,3,2.75,"Overall: tastes somewhat like a lighter / lower ABV version of the Coopers flagship Pale Ale and Sparkling Ale. The only problem with that is that it lacks any kind of individuality, and just leaves me thinking 'Why not just get a Pale Ale?" If I was getting a semi-craft lower ABV beer, I'd just get a Little Creatures' Rogers beer.","SmashPants","Jan 23, 2013"
