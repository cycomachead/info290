3.58,-4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, tea, and citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and tea flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite mild but tasty.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 27, 2013"
