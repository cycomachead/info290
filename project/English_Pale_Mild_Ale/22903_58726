Is it a world beater ? no, of course not but it does what it sets out to do, a good brew for those who can't grab an english export to experience the genesis of the style.","Ego","Oct 20, 2013"

3.33,12.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, grains, a bit bready. Taste is light and mild, some breadyness and malts, not a very strong flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.","tone77",
