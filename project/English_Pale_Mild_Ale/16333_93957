3.64,1.4,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Deep brown in color with a half inch tightly knit beige head. Light Brussels lacing. Aroma of dark,biscuity malt is what I'm getting from the nose. The taste is caramel and light chocolate and is delicately done. There's a gentle bitterness from the darker malt at the back of the palate. The mouth is dry and creamy,very much a sessionable beer.","Franziskaner","Jun 16, 2014"

Not a bad beer by any means, years ago I would have loved this, but becoming more of a hop head Pale Ale/IPA type, this one just is too thin for me now.","paladinjoe","Apr 02, 2014"

3.43,-4.5,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Woodychandler, a couple of reviews below this one, has it wrong. I recieved this beer from him in one of his beautiful packages. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is a bit malty, biscuity. Taste is nutty, a good bit of malts, a touch of toffee, just a bit unusual. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a different and enjoyable beer.","tone77","Sep 05, 2013"
3.77,5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Picked up a can from the Ale Jail in St. Paul. It's always a pleasant surprise to find another session beer on the shelf, and I'm always a fan of milds. As it should be, it's malty beer. It's a touch heavier than I'd expect, but doesn't feel too filling. It's a sweet mild, with a sugar cookie, English biscuit and a bit of toffee. There's a smooth fruity undertone and really no hops to speak of.","tempest","Aug 19, 2013"
4.26,18.7,4.5,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,"The Crack and inverted Glug went smoothly, right up until it started creating a massive head above a pseudo-cascading action and I was forced to back off. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity (SRM = ~ 34). Settling, I had two fingers of dense, foamy, light-tan head, like the top of a mocha shake. Nose was syrupy sweet and slightly buttery. I felt as though I were sitting down to pancakes. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was, well, mild. Not too sweet, not at all bitter, and with just enough diacetyl that even I could discern it (and usually, I CANnot). Given the style's descriptor(s) on this site, I would say that they nailed it. Finish was semi-sweet, not over the top in terms of its sweetness in any way. This, combined with its relatively low ABV, made for a nice nightcap. I am going to retire for the day after I finish. I guess that if you are looking for a sessionable beer, you could do way worse than some of these.","woodychandler","Aug 18, 2013"

The taste is also very mellow and light. With some roasted malt notes, and toffee flavors. Light flavors, but nice either wise. Overall its a nice flavored lighter beer.","vette2006c5r","Aug 03, 2013"

3.99,11.1,4.5,4.25,4,3,4,"I like this beer! Poured a bit cold out of the can, but with a large, fluffy, frothy, foamy, light tan head that soon settles to a light cover and some lace. Color is a clear mahogany with some bubble trails. Aroma is a fresh malt, molasses, grain, hop. Flavor's like nose and light with a touch of bitter at the end. Body is odd as it's good on one hand, yet a bit thin too. Carbonation is good. Finish is like flavor, has bitter going to sweet, and has some length. Pretty good drinking stuff all in all.","drpimento","Jul 17, 2013"
