2.53,-28.1,4,3.5,2,2.5,2,"I had this on tap as part of a sampler, this was one of most disappointing beers for sure...It actually looks really nice, nice gold color, good retention...The aroma is nice too, light but gives off some decent hops...The taste is terrible, all skunk from start to finish, nothing redeeming here at all. At 3.5% I'd almost rather drink an American macro.","jrallen34","Jun 18, 2006"
5,42,5,5,5,5,5,"What a great session beer that taste like a beer. Great yeast notes mildly hopped but in balance. Not astringent like some mild beers that turn out watery. This beer is light in body but throws a great head, it is after all a session beer. Great for drinking but it really doesn't stand up to having with a meal. Just enjoy one at the bar. Faint brown to copper color.","ComputerBeer","Nov 10, 2005"
3.65,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Appears light gold with a short white head in my glass. There's a sweet biscuit aroma with herbal hops. A little more hops come out in the flavor with a fresh cut grass note. The overall flavor here is light, but it's also delicate and relatively complex. I'll call this a good session beer.","tempest","Mar 29, 2005"
2.9,-17.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Very sessionable at 3.5% and still aroma and taste, but skip it for the pils. Aroma was both hoppy and malty. Orangey with a little white head, with lace. Bitterness and a bit of fruit, metallic finish. A light mouthfeel and prickly active carbonation. Perhaps the weakest in their lineup","Sammy","Sep 10, 2004"
3.26,-7.4,2,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"Originally reviewed on January 18, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. An orange-yellow pour, with no head. Light orange and cascade arom. Very light and very watery. Light bitter flavor, with light resin. Palate is light grassyness. Finish is sweet and a little puckery. Drinkable.","CharlesDarwin","Sep 08, 2004"
3.63,3.1,3.5,3,4,3,4,"Mild is sure is. Pours out to a light brown / hazy yellow color with a small head of white foam. Aromas are light, but hints of dark fruits and grain are noted. Taste is suprisingly robust for such a low ABV brew; malt, estery fruits, mashed grain, mild hops. Nice. Mouthfeel was mediocre and had no real character. Drinkability I must say is good. I could easily drink this for a session, no problem. Likely not for everyone, but worthy of a try.","Frozensoul327",
