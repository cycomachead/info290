2.6,-20.7,3,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Fruity aroma has a malty undertone, not much else. Pours a clear bright yellow with a fairly thick white head. Flavor is a little malty and a little fruity, with a weird varnish-like hint. Texture is rather thin and lacking fizz. Overall, not too hot. Nevertheless, it is drinkable, fine if nothing else is available.","Cyberkedi","Mar 27, 2012"

The clear bottle may have played a role in this beer's poor showing, but I suspect it's just a bit shit. Not recommended; spend your money on something else.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 21, 2011"

3.16,-3.7,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The style is subject to flaws since it is quite light and some flaws do come out. Too much grain, butter, and sulfur for my liking. Just a tad too many off flavors for me. Doesn't really drink clean.","Gmann","Mar 05, 2011"

3.82,16.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Let it warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a small to medium sized off white head that settled down to a big island and a little lace. Color is a nice straw amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, bread dough, yeast, and a bit floral. Flavor is similar to nose with nice balance between bitter, sweet, and tang. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of medium length. Session beer, not bad.","drpimento","Nov 11, 2010"
2.9,-11.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours a clear medium copper/amber color with a small and quickly disappearing head leaving a circle of lacing in the middle of glass. Scent is mostly of wheat with some floral scents as well mixed with some slightly bitter malts. Taste is very weak and dry. Has a semi bitter taste as well. I'm not sure if this is how the beer is suppose to taste or if has gone skunky even though there was a decent sound when I cracked open the bottle. If this is how the beer is suppose to taste it is too weak and taste is less than appealing. Considering the price you'd be better off going with a cheap macro-brew than this beer.","Lemke10","Sep 12, 2010"
3.67,11.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a very light bodied honey gold in color with a light white lacing around the glass. The aromas are both sweet and bitter. It has a real honey tea vibe going on that is pretty appealing. The flavors are pretty similar but a little more bland. There is little flavor aside from tea leaves with a dash of sweet pale malts/honey. It's not too bad. It's easily drinkable and is pretty light in body. For 2.99 and ticking another style, it wasn't a bad pickup.","aasher",
