3,-14.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Brownish and transparent colour, small lasting off-white head. No doubt it’s a pale ale, but it seems to be relatively modestly hopped. Aroma includes biscuits, finish is a little sweet. A more than decent alternative to your Mexican lager. Nothing special but not bad.","stoutman","Jul 11, 2012"

3.77,7.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A not-so-sanely categorized beer - this is a pale ale, no foolin', with a clear identity schism between Yankee and Red Coat - regarding the booze alone (props though to the seamless integration) discounts the given classification (Miiild? There's nothing miiild about it!). Anyway, a decent ale, flavourful, and moderately hopped. Worth the pesos, that point is beyond reproach.","biboergosum","Apr 20, 2012"

3.76,6.8,4,3,4,4,4,"Very tasty english brew. Easily sessionable. Opens up very nicely as it warms up. A very good interpretation of the English Ales. The style may seem boring to some of the BAs used to bolder American Ales. However this is a truly great beer and very nice for a session, every day brew. Highly recommended. Probably one of the best regular ales brewed in Mexico.","luisfrancisco","Beers"
