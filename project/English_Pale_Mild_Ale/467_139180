3.91,-1,4.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"Massive head with a great head retention, bright and clear dark copper hue. Very toasty, fresh bread, and biscuity nose and palate. Hint of lemony hop zest and alcohol in the middle and dry throughout. Packed with soooo much flavor, a lovely malt bomb and warming as well. Not all Mild Ales need to be small quaffable brews, loving this ale.","Jason","Jan 18, 2015"
3.98,0.8,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"The taste has a very subtle malt and lightly roasted flavor with nutty english malt character with slight hops in the taste -just enough to keep things in balance. The yeast has a mostly clean flavor yet it accentuates the beautiful malt and slightly dry pine flavored finish with almost no alcohol in the taste. Overall a very good 'Imperial Mild' it carries a lot of the session beers style into a strong version which is excellent drinkability wise -Kudos Summit!","Slatetank","Jan 12, 2015"

4.17,5.6,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a pub pint glass. Amber color, 1 inch cream white head that lingers. As it recedes, it leaves sticky lacing. Low to moderate carbonation. Malty aroma a bit bready with some fruit. Malt initial taste, just a bit roasty with fruity presence also, transitioning to bitter, bready aftertaste. Definitely English in the balance. Feel is initially tingly/ bitter with a thickish texture.  It is a very good English-style mild, in spite of being too high in ABV for the style. It does not in any way taste boozy, however. I'll be stocking up on this one before it disappears forever, and perhaps I'll cellar a couple of sixers, too. Once again, Summit nails it with the Union series. Congrats to Summit brewer  Damian McConn!","MNAle","Jan 04, 2015"

4.18,5.8,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall:  The Union series has another winner here with the 3X Mild ale, which I would probably describe as more of an English pale ale (or even "strong ale") instead of a mild.  It is a malty treat, plenty of fruit and barley with earthy hops for balance.","Mdog","Dec 22, 2014"
