3.91,-1,4.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"Massive head with a great head retention, bright and clear dark copper hue. Very toasty, fresh bread, and biscuity nose and palate. Hint of lemony hop zest and alcohol in the middle and dry throughout. Packed with soooo much flavor, a lovely malt bomb and warming as well. Not all Mild Ales need to be small quaffable brews, loving this ale.","Jason","Jan 04, 2015"
3.98,0.8,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"The taste has a very subtle malt and lightly roasted flavor with nutty english malt character with slight hops in the taste -just enough to keep things in balance. The yeast has a mostly clean flavor yet it accentuates the beautiful malt and slightly dry pine flavored finish with almost no alcohol in the taste. Overall a very good 'Imperial Mild' it carries a lot of the session beers style into a strong version which is excellent drinkability wise -Kudos Summit!","Slatetank","Jan 04, 2015"
