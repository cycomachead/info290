3.59,5.9,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy medium golden amber with a fine one finger ivory head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet, mildly biscuit malt, tea, a hint of nuts. Flavor follows, with mild, almost diluted biscuit malt, a hint of grassy hops, finishing with a dry hop bitterness with little hop flavor. Light bodied with good carbonation. The malt and light hops seemed very English in flavor, and although the flavor felt a bit attenuated, that seems fair for an ale named "mild". Good malt flavor and light, but English style hops. This is not a style I have much experience with, so I'm not sure how much flavor I should be expecting. The taste that is present is pleasant, but light and appropriately British.","LiquidAmber","Feb 28, 2014"

The aroma has an interesting fruitiness to it, like dates. A kiss of plain chocolate and a slight amount of hops brings some hope to the taste. There is some flavor, although it's simple and not intense. A kiss of chocolate and vague esters make much of the flavor, which overall is okay. It's light bodied and a little watery, but would be an okay choice as a lower alcohol beer.","DoubleJ","Dec 13, 2013"

3.52,3.8,3.75,3,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Overall, drink this from a glass. It tastes terrible from the can. From the glass, it's not great, not bad, just a little above average. Not sure why this ale is classified as an English Pale Mild Ale. It tasted like a regular malt-forward American Amber Ale to me. Some of their Utah competitors brew much better brews. To be fair, I'd say this brew fits the month because this is the time of year when peaches and apricots have ripened in the hot summer sun. Fairly refreshing.","Jsteez",
