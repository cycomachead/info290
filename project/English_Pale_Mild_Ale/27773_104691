3.46,6.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, amber-copper coloring, with a ton of carbonation throughout the body, and a low profile, fluffy, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of tangy caramel and roasted toffee forward, with some sugary sweet highlights and woody notes. Aromas are a bit muted. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a blast of rich, tangy sweet toffee, bordering on sugary, with some darker caramel undertones. Subtle roast and bitterness in the tail end, but overall cloyingly sweet. The body is light and somewhat effervesced by the steady flow of carbonation. The aftertaste is more of the roasted and rich characteristics that have been present throughout. The finish is light, a bit crisp, and the sweet characteristics do hang out quite a bit.","GarthDanielson","Dec 28, 2013"
