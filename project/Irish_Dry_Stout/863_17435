3.73,4.5,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"probably underrated here, this was the only beer i had at russian river that was neither hoppy or sour that really impressed me. its a big chalky textured stout thats as dry as they come, but loaded with deep earthy roast that never turns acrid or bitter. its drinkable too at a real low abv and a mouthfeel that almost leaves me thirsty. there are coffee notes in here too, rich and creamy in that way, but a dark chocolate complexion arises before the finish. i get the grain before the flavors it produces, which is how i like it. yeast has done a complete job here, residual sugar is nil. its really easy to put this one back, although maybe it does lack a finish just a bit. i had no idea russian river made beers that werent the hop bombs or the sours, and while most of the ones i tried were pretty pedestrian, this stout really stood out as a top quality beer.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

I got some burnt malt but not overpowering as in some other stouts. I tasted caramel, chocolate and coffee with no off-putting sourness I've experienced in some stouts. Very crisp and refreshing finish. I highly recommend giving this one a try if you're near the brewery. It's a tap-only deal.","Antnego","Jul 27, 2014"

Aroma was chocolate, coffee, dark malts, great. Flavor was exactly the same and so robust. This was delicious and I'd order pints regularly if I ever saw it on tap.","ArrogantB","May 05, 2014"

3.84,7.6,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Tried as part of a sampler at the brewery. This was a black pour with super creamy light brown khaki head. Chocolate and espresso on the aroma, plenty of roast to go along. Surprised at the big aroma for such a light stout. Big chocolate and roasted coffee flavor, finishes with lingering charred roast. This has more flavor than I have had in any dry stout. Nicely done. Very thin mouthfeel that goes down very easy with velvety carb. Not bad at all, and I would have this again despite this being one of my least favorite styles.","BMMillsy","Feb 17, 2014"

4.3,20.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The aroma was loaded with roasted malts, though not as heavy as one would expect given the big look of it. Light hope notes were also noticed in here, with a small plum or raisin like note, almost like some dark Belgian yeast was used. As it warmed some light cocoa started to show as well. The flavor was more of the same. Started out with a nice bit of roasted malts, which then careened off into a slightly hoppy finish. Lots of cocoa and light licorice hints swirling around in the background, giving it some nice depth. Very nice feel, rich, full bodied, with good carbonation that led to never a dull moment, and something that would be best categorized as not very dry at all.","mikesgroove","Aug 02, 2011"

3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Beer is super smooth and medium in body. There is a little sweetness up front and some midpalate hoppiness to it. That is followed up by some really nice bitterness from the roast with a moderately dry finish. This is a great beer to have a nitro. A cask version would also be quite good. So silky smooth.

4.02,12.6,4,4.5,4,3,4,"I only realized this was on nitro as they brought it out to me. At first I was bummed because the only nitro beer I've enjoyed is Murphy's, and I've tried a few. There's over a finger of solid tan head that's clearly not going anywhere. The beer is black opaque with nothing pulling through in terms of light. Aromas are roasted coffee and chocolate. Flavors are similar with an emphasis on the espresso. Great coffee and chocolate flavors melding together. Mouthfeel is light with low carb, which is nitro's biggest downfall in my opinion. This is a delicious beer, with the only bummer being the lighter, undercarbonated body.","washburnkid","Jan 08, 2010"

Very creamy tan head, as should be expected from a nitro pour. The head sticks around quite well and leaves some fine lacing. Smells quite roasty with some light earthy hops. Tastes a little on the thinner side, with some sour graininess, some medium roastiness, and a fairly bitter, earthy finish. Smooth and roasty in the mouth, could be a tad creamier. Enjoyable for bing so low abv.","Georgiabeer","Apr 01, 2009"
3.89,9,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - One of the finest nitro pours I've ever been served. Very good dry Irish stout with an emphasis on the roast, yet it also packs plenty of hop bitterness. The nutty character also adds more depth, making for a tasty brew.","ffejherb","Feb 03, 2009"

There were some lurking coffee and chocolate notes in the aroma. The beer delivered more taste than the smell indicated. It has a light roasted malt flavor than is better balanced and more interesting than most beers of this style. The beer was still somewhat light-bodied for me. I probably would have loved this beer back when I was primarily drinking Guinness, but BA has happily ruined those days for me. It's a drinkable stout with a great flavor and a light body.","popery","Sep 24, 2008"
4.2,17.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the RR brewpub. Pours pitch black with a dark beige head. Nose- dark roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste- very dry and roasty with wood and smoky undertones.

Easy to drink, a great session stout.","baiser","Mar 09, 2005"
4.36,22.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Solid brown nitro top adds a dark, solid color contrast between the black body and brown top. Aromas of mild vanilla and cappucino.

Thankfully not very sweet. Notes of toasty grains. Quiet and addictive brew.","donnebaby","Feb 02, 2005"

4.38,22.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This stout poured an opaque black color with light brown foam that clinged and coated the glass a bit. Impressive for a beer on cask. The smell was slightly sweet and malty (very roasted) with notes of cocoa. The taste was roasted malt with elements of cocoa and oats(?). Very delicious. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall it was dry with only hints of light sweetness. It was relatively clean. This was a very nice stout, and was one of the best beers offered at the Real Ale Fest.","UncleJimbo","May 08, 2004"
4.48,25.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pulls from the cask an onyx color the head thick and tall, the color chocolate brown, the texture creamy with the lace a glutinous sheet to cling mightily to the glass. Nose was sweet chocolate; coffee with a rich toasted grain aroma to end it all, start was ambrosia, rich in malt and the top full and creamy. Finish was gentle in it acidity, the hops perfection, somewhat bittersweet and dry aftertaste, I voted this the hit of the fest at least for me, and just missed by a frog hair of getting some at OBriens, damn well better luck next time.","Gusler","Beers"
3.73,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This light colored stout, it leans more towards brown than black, left some of the best lacing I have encountered. A solid coating really added to the ambience. This beer had a strong roasty aroma, taste profile seemed to have some strong licorice notes to it, almost imparted a medicinal taste. A well made stout that just didn't quite make it with me taste wise. Could grow on you though. Ful bodied and enjoyable if you can adapt to the different taste.","Mark","0"
