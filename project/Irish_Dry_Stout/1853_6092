Very smooth, from nitro, but at the  price of overall body. Decent stout, but not a particularly big one. Drinkable, and goes down very easily; traits enhanced by being dry as opposed to the cloying sweetness some big stouts can have and by the slight bitterness that makes you want to return to the glass frequently.","logicalparadox","Sep 24, 2014"

Dark as night with a rich and creamy tan head that rose up from the bottom and settled down very nicely along the top of the glass. Bu that was about the best it would get. Too light of a n aroma, as roasted malts and chocolate notes seem to be horribly off balance. Hints of coffee maybe? But it all seemed to be a bit of a mess for me to be honest. Smooth, even carbonation on a somewhat mellow profile, needed a bit more of a punch to really be anything worthwhile to me. Roasted chocolate, hints of tobacco, a light sweetness, but again it really all seemed terribly off balance to me","mikesgroove","Jun 20, 2011"
3.34,-9.7,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"O- overall it does not have enough going on, flavors need to be more assertive to pull off the lack of acidity from going nitro.

Nice and creamy on nitro though as long as the head lasts. Fairly drinkable.","Rifugium","Feb 23, 2011"

The color is a deep brownish black with a really nice creamy brown head on it thats sticky and laces pretty well. The aromas are lightly roasted slight smooth creamy aromas too. The taste is very smooth kind of on the flat side but the nitro makes it that way. The mouthfeel is very light and easy to drink.

4.29,15.9,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O'Reilly's Irish Stout by Sly Fox is pretty much all one would ask for in a dry Irish Dry Stout. This beer, served on nitrogen, carefully poured at Local 44, is pitch black with a fluffy, 2.5 inches of beige meringue foam. The beer has just a faint wisp of chalky roasted grain. This beer tastes almost perfect. It is plenty dry with flavorful espresso and dark chocolate roasted flavors. The hop bitterness strong and a bit surprising considering the mellow hop flavors in Guiness, but it works well with the creamy, silky mouthfeel, accentuating the dryness of the beer. This is a pleasure to drink and at 3.6%, it is very easy to keep going with it all night long. The only thing was that the roasted grain and bitterness from hops made this just a bit too astringent, but overall, fantastic.","Soonami","Aug 07, 2010"

The beer had a beautiful jet black color with a long lasting silky 1 inch head of beige foam. It looked good enough to eat. It had a faint aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a pinch of sweet caramel at the end. The taste was dry (no duh!) with dark roasted malts, a splash of sweet caramel, a hint of bitter dark chocolate, a pinch of herbs, and then all of this ended with some dried roasted bitter hops. The mouthfeel was light and dry with a faint aftertaste of dried roasted malts and dried roasted hops. Even though the aftertaste was faint, the dryness of the roasted flavors lingered on for a few minutes. It wasn't the best Irish Stout I've had, but it was still a good one even though the aroma was faint and it seemed like the flavors needed to come out just a little bit more.","AltBock","Oct 08, 2007"

Had a very dark black color with a think, creamy, tan head that head great retention and left a lot of lacing through out. The aromas where of burnt grain with some coffee and chocolate highlights. The flavors seemed to mimic the aroma highlights but a coffee bitterness really came through which was nice being mixed with chocolate flavors.

Smelled primarily of roasted and sweet malts as well as dark grain and some floral and bitter hops Tasted great - creamy roasted malt and barley with a bit of bitterness and a great dry finish.

Keep that flavor on my palate for jkust a bit longer, and I'd drink this over all but a handful of beers.

My favorite part was the mouthfeel: a delectable creaminess that had the texture of milk (but without the heavy lactose taste.) Drinkability was slow for me- by the time I drank the pint dry, my dinner partner was finished his second beer. This is a stout to savor and enjoy, not to pound.","StoutHearted","Mar 16, 2006"

Plenty of chocolate and roast flavour with a bit of hop character as well. Quite dry, but with a pleasant sweetness. There's some nuttiness as it warms as well.

Flavors run wild, which is rare for this often-copied style that often turns out bland and flavorless, especially when served on nitro. Coffee, chocolate, and big toasted almond and walnut flavors meld into an extremely mild hoppy bitter finish, complemented by a slight sugar sweetness. As smooth and creamy as they come. Forget everything you think you know about Irish Dry Stouts (ie Guinness, though I do love her) and try this. It's available in quite a few places and seems to be more available than any other Sly Fox offering. Drinkable by the bucketful.","IrishRedRock","Mar 24, 2005"
3.91,5.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Quite a nice example of an Irish dry stout. Nitro pour with a cascade of a rich head of tiny bubbles. Dark black color, smell is hard to make out in the bar, but it smelled kind of roasty. For a 3.6 dry stout, this has quite a bit of flavor. Roasted malt wtih some chocolate and coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is typically nitro smooth. They have this and Guiness on tap at Grace. Why anyone would ever choose Guiness over this one, I have no idea. It's nice and drinkable with just enough flavor to keep it interesting.","whartontallboy","Oct 28, 2004"
3.54,-4.3,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pretty good example of the style. Not among the best stouts I've had but certainly a solid beer. Poured on a slow nitro pour into a imperial pint glass. Looks pretty much like a Guinness and is dark as night. Smell is fairly non-existent although some roasted malts are present. Taste is kinda subdued cause of the nitro, but is dominated by roasted malts, bakers chocolate and a nice clean slightly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is full and rich up front, a tad thin in the end. Very drinkable at only 3.6% ABV with a nitro pour. I give them credit for not just creating a generic brew-pub stout.","ChrisBowers","May 18, 2004"
4.5,21.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On Nitro Tap at Grace. This is an absolutely amazing dry irish stout, probably the best one that I have sampled thus far in my beer tasting exploits. This is a beautiful looking beer. Opaque black in colour with a lovely tan/khaki head that lasts for ages. The aromas are awesome! Roasted malts, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, a bit of vanilla, and more. Wow, this is like a Rogue Shakespeare stout stuffed into the frame of a 3.6%abv dry irish stout! The taste is roasty, with some lovely chocolate and coffee notes and the mouthfeel is thick creamy and awesome. Drinkability I hear you ask? Awesome as well! And at 3.6%ABV you can drink this all night and not worry about the next morning! My first beer from Sly Fox, and it has made a big impression!","francisweizen","Apr 07, 2004"
3.96,7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: very drinkable as the flavor is strong and it is lighter in body for a stout.","Gavage","Sep 07, 2003"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep black color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a dry black malt scent. It seems a bit heavy on roasted and patent malts. The taste is good. It is dominated with black patent and roasted malts. It finishes dry, but with good mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine stout. It has a good malt makeup and mouthfeel.","WesWes","Jul 23, 2003"
3.67,-0.8,5,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Many a brewpub has tried to emulate the dry stouts of erin's isle, but this one has finally pulled it off! It's the perfect dry Irish stout served via nitrogen carbonation and dispense; and it rivals Beamish, Murphy's, and Guinness. There's not much in the nose (as to style!), but it's soft and creamy in the mouth due to the soft carbonation and densely creamy head due to the nitrogen breakout. It doesn't have the lightly sour tang of Guinness, but it does offers a touch more bittersweet chocolate than most which gives it a bit of a unique edge. It's roasty with a thin bit of malt underneath, and backed by a solid bitterness in the 40 to 50 IBU range. It's light body lends to its drinkability; and it finishes short and dry. An impressive rendition of the style, and an excellent 'end of the night' beer that offers alot of flavor with a limited alcohol - although it's equally at home as a session beer for the evening. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Jul 19, 2003"
4.23,14.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow what a pour,pours a pitch black with a great creamy head that leaves some real nice lacing,smells very dry and earthy.The taste is dry and earthy with some unsweetened chocolate under tones.A real complex dry stout,very enjoyable,first time trying,wil be sure to get again.","oberon","Mar 17, 2003"
4.5,21.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is probably the biggest surprise for me from sly fox. Dark black in color with a thick creamy nitro head. Aroma is of roasted coffee. Taste is chocolate with some coffee as well. Whenever I order a dry stout I never expect anything more than guinness, but this was fantastic.","dmarch","Jan 24, 2003"

3.79,2.4,4.5,3,4,4,4,"Rich thick tan head. Dark opaque look. The lasting thick creamy head does impress. Not much nose to speak of.. just a whisp of roast in the back of the throat. Very roasty malty taste with hints of expresso on the back of the tongue. Dry toasty finish left on the tongue. A solid Dry Stout.. the only area it was lacking was in the nose.","frank4sail","Dec 15, 2002"
4.11,11.1,5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours an opaque black with some light mahogany hues. Head is quite creamy and looks very much like a Guinness. I was very pleased to find the beer to have a much more complex flavor profile than ye 'old Guin. Flavors ranged from a bittersweet chocolate to coffee to a nice underlying roastiness. Mouthfeel was creamy and on the light side, but was still very pleasing.","jreitman","Beers"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an opaque black with slight ruby or mahogany highlights. The head is decent; light tan in color, dense and very creamy, lasts all the way through. On the nose the aroma was deep roastiness, bittersweet chocolate, coffee flavorsÂ…all of the same can also be found in the flavor, coffee, chocolate, roastiness, slight bitternessÂ…mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. The is very comparable to a Beamish, a very good dry stoutÂ…","WilliamPhilaPa","0"
