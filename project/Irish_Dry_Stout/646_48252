4.61,15,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Pitch black beer with a creamy white head. Nose is the malt character of an RIS, but a full cocoa roundness. Hints of coffee, and the lightest minty pine from the English hops. Taste is smooth, like a nitro but not. chocolate, coffee, caramel and a full malt bill with light roast to balance out, maybe a touch of nutiness. Very dry but a round slickness that gives a sweet impression. Lightest hop at the end that lingers with the chocolate. It sticks in the nose as well. Wow, this beer far surpasses the other O'hara's I've had. What a treat and a hella price over at Tully's in wells. $2.50 a 330 bottle or something.","redleaves","Oct 04, 2013"

4.06,1.2,4,4.25,4,4,4," The flavor is very coffee and biscuit from the malt up front with a slight caramel tinge in the mid palate and herbal hops add complexity in the flavor with the light mineral yeast accent and subtle smoke in the taste from the highly kilned malt delivers a nice amount of layered flavor with some light cocoa notes and wood notes with earthy elements in the background. Overall this is a very tasty stout...I didn't expect so much malt complexity but this is a topnotch example of the style. I would recommend this to any stout fan","Slatetank","Aug 13, 2013"
3.96,-1.2,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Leann Follain is an excellent example of an Irish Dry Stout. It's got a bit more flavor than most Irish Dry Stouts, with the very well balanced chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors mingling nicely. The flavor doesn't linger for long, leaving a nice, dry finish. Overall, a great Irish Dry Stout that's a bit stronger and more interesting than the pack.","shand","Aug 11, 2013"

3.93,-2,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and coffee beans. Taste is much the same with cookie dough and cocoa powder flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and super easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 01, 2013"

It has an unexpectedly sharp bite, but it doesn't seem to be hoppy so I'm kind of confused where that bite comes from. It also tastes quite roasted/smokey ... sort of overpowers any other subtle flavors that might be hiding underneath.","Vierenner","Sep 18, 2012"

4.2,4.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste is excellent! After having the regular dry stout, this one is much better. Roast is exceptionally smoother than most dry stouts, an amazing feat that fades seamlessly into dark chocolate. Fruit is prevalent, but never goes overboard. Body is full without being sweet, another impressive aspect. The bitterness throws in a nice curveball too. Best 'o the O'hara bunch me thinks!","twiggamortis420","Aug 25, 2011"

4.57,14,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: This is what Irish stouts should taste like. The best in this style that I've had. It isn't a Foreign Export, because it lacks the sourness and heavy hops, and it isn't a true Irish dry because it's a bit heavier and much more robust. Take it for what it is: one of the best beers Ireland has to offer. Recommended!","JohnnyChicago","Feb 01, 2011"

4.12,2.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Picked this up in Sheil's off Licence on Dorset Street, Dublin for about E2.40 per bottle. Pours almost pitch black in colour with a dark brown hue on closer inspection. Head is latte in colour - settles after pouring to about a fingernail's height in the glass and is retained well. Aroma is quite complex - cocoa, coffee and malt with some burnt/roasted notes. Taste is slightly bitter with strong coffee, smoke, and dark chocolate flavours. Mouthfeel is quite dry and cleansing on the palate - goes down nicely. Very drinkable dry stout that doesn't fill you up too quickly and the 6% volume isn't too taxing. All in all, it's an excellent stout and well worth a go.","Ruaidhri","Apr 12, 2009"
