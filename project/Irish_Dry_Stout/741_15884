3.45,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, cocoa nibs, and slight coffee. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and slightly sour dark fruit. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel but pretty thin mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Irish style stout but the mouthfeel is a bit lacking in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 02, 2012"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, and roasted malt. The flavor was of roasted malt, cream, earth, and subtle toasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This brew really didn't wow in any way, but it was quite easy to drink and a good representation of the style. This one felt to have more of a toasted flavor to it as compared to roastiness which is typical in most brews. This was a welcomed change. Worth trying if you have not had it before and like the style or are just curious.","thagr81us","Apr 01, 2012"

Nose is a burnt grain mixture with some, chocolate, coffee, smoke and mild citrus and metallic twang in the finish. Taste is metallic with quite a solid citrus presence from the hops. Also picking up on yeast in the taste along with some smoke character. The taste is actually a disappointment from what the nose led on.

3.58,3.8,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"The Snake Chaser Irish Stout is a decent beer that is certainly worth a try. Its tightly formed tan head sits on top of a deep dark brown body. It looks like something familiar, but the taste is much less conventional than I expected. I couldn't pick up much off the nose; both bottles that I sampled gave off only an occasional whiff of roasted malt. Medium-light bodied with a moderate dose of fine carbonation that adds to the balance of this beer. Initial light roasted malt flavors are quickly subdued by hop bitterness and a touch of acidity. Coffee with a dash of unsweetened chocolate combines with a mostly dry finish. I found this stout easy to drink and would expect this to be a much better beer off a fresh tap or cask.","86sportster883","May 02, 2007"

3.28,-4.9,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours nearly black with a thick, medium tan head that retains well. Sheets of lacing in the pint glass. Nose is of dark roasted malts, baker's chocolate and espresso. The palate is a well-balanced blend of roasted/burnt malt flavors a solid dry hop backbone. Has a slightly bitter flavor, reminiscent of a scorched malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium and finished very dry. Gets better as it warms, opening up the flavors a bit. A good example of the dry stout style, I think.","beerphilosopher","Mar 29, 2007"

3.56,3.2,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Nice caramel head that dissipates rather quickly on top of a coal-like black brew. Nose is a suble, smokey/sweet mix. Nothing too special yet. Once I started drinking this I realized what a quality stout this is. Creamy, but not too this, this has a near-perfect mix of flavors for the style: smokey malts, black coffee, and dark caramel. A little tinge of alcohol on the tongue and a slight carbonation just add to the enjoyment. Not terribly heavy for a stout and much easier to drink than most stouts.","GDMFSOB","Mar 24, 2007"
4.08,18.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"As stouts go, this one is a real winner. Incredibly rich, almost black in the glass with a small head (this is no Guinness in the foam department); all smoky malt in the nose. Decent mouthfeel and very fresh-tasting for a stout. A touch sweet on the tongue, then the smoky malts kick in (almost a porter-rich taste) but the overall flavor is balanced with a bit (tiny bit) of fruity hops that kicks in a nice bitterness in the end and makes the beer overall extremely drinkable. Excellent.","tugdriver7","Jan 13, 2007"
3.43,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"The taste is similar, with notes of coffee, dark chocolates, and dark fruits coming through. All in all this is quite a tasty stout, although it seems more American than Irish. A minor sore spot I have with this brew is the mouthfeel, which is on the thin side and a bit too carbonated for my liking. Still, this beer is incredibly drinkable, and a nice beer for a cold day. Solid.","BBM","Jul 22, 2006"

3.3,-4.3,4,4,3,3,3,"When I was in third grade Ms. Weinberg used to put a bear on her desk on the certain days that she was grouchy and would warn us, "Don't cross me when the bear is out." These were days when she would deliver fatal blows to students: "This is the worst handwriting I've ever seen. Go home tonight and practice until you can write in perfect cursive." I wish Lakefront Brewery had a bear to put out on their bottles to indicate when a brew is a dirty little imitator. They are so hit and miss for a microbrew that it is almost confounding how decent one beer tastes as compared to another's blandness. Luckily this one isn't one of the bad ones. It delivers a reasonable dark stout flavor with a hint of sweetness. No kissing the urine soaked Blarney stone here.","thelagerheads","Mar 14, 2006"

3.77,9.3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This brew pours a solid black color. The head is one-finger in height, tan, and had an off-white ring around the top along the edge of the glass. The aroma is roasted and chocolate malts with a hint of graham cracker in the background. It is quite aromatic for an Irish Style Stout. The taste does not disappoint either. It is nothing overpowering or big, but it is a bit more than is expected from a small stout. Lots of roasted malt shows though up front with a touch of chocolate in the back ground. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with nice carbonation. It could be a little smoother though, but it isn't bad. Overall, this is one of the better Irish Stouts I have had the pleasure of trying. I would certainly choose this over Guinness anyday.","KarlHungus","Beers"

The brew seems to have a little more carbination that your typical stout and perhaps this is why the mouthfeel is a little thinner than the average stout. Unlike other stouts I think I could have this with dinner and be able to drink this bottle and few more without feeling bloated. I wonder how this brew would taste through a nitro-tap.","lampkins","Feb 12, 2004"
4.07,18,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Snake Chaser pours black in color with some dark mahogany highlights near the bottom of the glass. Finger thick creamy tan head reduces to a surface covering that lingers throughout most of consumption. Aroma consists of roasted malt, roasted coffee, with hints of sweet cocoa as the beer warms and just a touch of caramel. Very pleasant. The mouthfeel is thinner to medium-bodied with some coarse carbonation. Flavors of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate upfront. Dryness starts in the middle. Smooth burnt malt and roasted coffee flavors round out the dry lingering finish. Flavor is very full and satisfying. The dryness is classic for an Irish Stout. Very well done.
