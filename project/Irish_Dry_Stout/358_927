Not as available, really anyway compared to Guinness or Murphy's but that is what you beer snob dweebs are pretty much into, yeah? Go out getcha some Beamish!!! (If you can find it!

If in Ireland, I would reccomend buying one of these before Guinness, they are just as widely availible as the other legendary stout. It is famous for being slightly cheaper too.

The flavor was very creamy with notes of light milk chocolate and coffee. The roasted malt flavor was very mild when compared to other dry stouts.

Mouthfeel is medium and super creamy thanks the widget. Slightly chewy, but finishes with just a tinge of sour, not sticky at all. Like others of this style, I could down these one after another.

Light aromas of coffee and chocolate come though the glass and beg to be taken in with large gulps.

There is also some chocolate in there as well, nothing strong but it's there. The taste, like the smell, was pretty predictable. A nice light roasted flavor, that small hint of chocolate, and unlike the smell I got just a dab of coffee as well. Nice refreshing taste. The mouthfeel is really creamy. I wouldn't say it's thick but it's definitely not thin, kind of almost chewy but more creamier than anything. Drinkability is high for this one. With a ABV lower than Bud Light kicking back a few of these wouldn't be a problem. This one definitely contends with Guinness and Murphys, not sure which of the three I like best but all are great.

Theres a hint of maltiness and maybe some mild sweetness, but the bitter, dry finish somewhat mutes that point. The feel is thin and watery in a way. It is rather smooth, however. Though it would be easy to pound these back, you would likely be left unsatisified by the lack of flavour and the odd viscosity.

Eventually settles into a tight and thick head which lasts the entire pint and leaves rings of lace the whole way down. Smell is typically underwhelming, roasted malt and light chocolate, and the flavour profile follows. Slightly bitter, with a dry bite in the background, but not quite so bitter as the other big Irish stouts. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and just a little too thin, and drinkability is fantastic.

It's mild enough that it won't conflict with any food pairing, and simultaneously robust enough to stand up to anything. One of my all-time favorites.

Little carbonation visible. Smell was similar, just a touch of smoky malts. Initial tastes were quite different. Beamish was smooth in the mouth, with a well balanced, drinkable mix of malt flavors and a hint of sweetness that made it very easy to drink--top to bottom. The Guinness was similar, but with a bit more hops bitterness that soon turned to a metallic hint of alcohol as it warmed.

A thick creamy head blankets the top of my glass and stays throughout the entire beer, even after the beer is gone the head remains in the bottom of the glass. Intense lacing sticks to the glass. The color is a rich dark mahogony. Strong aroma is present making me aware of the roasted malts that dominate this beer. All of the other Irish Stouts I have sampled had a faint aroma that was hard to detect, Beamish lets you know right away that you are going to enjoy their brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, this stout is beyond creamy with an exceptional finish. The flavor is bursting with rich roasted malts. Undertones of coffee are present. It is now known that Beamish is on the outs and this is unfortunate because in my opinion Guinness is very good, Murphy's is better, but Beamish is the cream of the crop. My only regret is that I was not able to discover this beer sooner. Fantastic Dry Stout, I'm going back to the store to stock up.","kinger","Jul 31, 2008"

Served it slighty chilled in my Samuel Smith pub glass. Poured a powerful midnight black color with a rapid expanding cocoa brown head. Smell was of roasted malts with some cocoa powder and brewed coffee. Taste was smooth as silk (thank you nitrogen bubbles) with heavy baker's chocolate in the front and light, sweet, roasted malts on the dry finish. I could see knocking back a few of these on St. Pat's day.","Portertime","May 21, 2008"

4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Beamish is a good Irish stout, and it gets a slight nod over Murphy's just because it's a bit more rare, I've found. It runs about neck and neck with Guinness for the style, so it's a good bet and probably a better value.","Gambrinus1184","May 07, 2008"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark brown almost black, but with some ruby edges in the light. A lovely 1 inch of creamy tan head forms after a nice fall, great retention and nice lacing. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee, but some dark fruit notes come out as it warms. Tastes of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and coffee with a dry hop finish. Smooth and creamy, low in carbonation, semi thick with a good roasted sweetness and a nice dry finish. Lots of flavor and low in alcohol, great Irish Dry Stout from a can.","HopDerek","May 02, 2008"
3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Much easier to drink than nitro versions of Guiness or Murphy's, but there is still an overall lack of flavor. Maybe an intro beer for someone new to the style, otherwise it's just for those with love of the nitro-can. Nitro-cans work for near flavorless pale beers (i.e. Boddingtons), but for something like a stout which should be full of flavor, it's "draught experience" at the expense of flavor.","PatrickJR","Apr 28, 2008"
4.5,18.4,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Pours out a dark ruby (almost black body) with a moderate sized, creamy nitro head. Leaves some nice lacing. Nose is kind of light from the nitro, but there is a nice presence of roast, dried fruit and a little hint of smoke. Taste really blows Guinness and Murphy's out of the water. I get chocolate, dried fruit, smoke, ash, coffee and wet, sweet tobacco. For what it is it does its job well. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy as the other nitro stouts (which IMO is a plus as it doesn't have such an artificial feel). There really aren't many bubbles on the tongue. Great drinkability.

It's mild but still quite aromatic with a range of nice qualities: chocolate, coffee, burnt toast, a hint of cherry - more rich and complex than usual. The taste also was unusually rich and strong, with a definite chocolate-coffee character backed up with toast, but not overly burnt, smooth and tasty, with a hint of fruit. It has a nice, light bitterness in the lingering smooth chocolate finish with hints of coffee. It is even a bit oily and quite smooth, tasty, and very drinkable. It shows that even a nitro dry stout can be really good.","Offa","Apr 18, 2008"

It laces the glass very well on the way down as well. The smell is of deep roasted malts, some coffee, some chocolate, some caramel, and a hint of hoppy bitterness at the end. The taste is really good. Very deep roasted malts are the base for a complex layering of chocolate, light coffee taste, and a hint of hoppy bitter at the end. The mouthfeel is very smooth with very tiny carbonation bubbles from the nitro widget inside the can. The drinkability is excellent. This beer does not have alot of alcohol, but it does have alot of flavor. This is my favorite Irish Dry Stout Yet.","erosier","Apr 03, 2008"

Initial flavor is sweet, creamy, and roasted all at the same time. Flavor ends on the roasted notes then to a dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. Some lacing, no carbonation once its poured, medium to full body, no alcohol noted.

It's a bit more filling than some of its brethren, but with such a practical ABV it drinks like a well-baked, if voluminous, pleasure.

Only a slight burnt astringency. Sweet. Flavors stay on the back of the tongue without the carbonation to wash them off. Fairly drinkable.

The coffee and chocolate flavors give this beer a nice mocha like finish and aftertaste. Slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy typical of a nitro but features a little more carbonation, which to me is a good thing. This beer has great drinkability. A very good stout and in my opinion much better than Murphy's or Guinness, only thing lacking is a virtually nonexistant aroma, not unpleasant just not much there. Still a good beer.","hckyfn9999","Jul 21, 2007"

The smell is of roast malt and other burnt/black malts along with black coffee. The taste great notes of dark malts, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and wood, and a little chalky too. Some bitterness from malts but no perceivable hop bitterness. All in all more pronounced flavor than guinness. The mouthfeel is good very nice and creamy very full slightly sweet finish all together pleasing.

This is one of the few beers I'm wiling to drink out of a can (some guy at the bar looked at me with disdain and ordered a Bud Light, but asked to make sure he got it in a bottle, as he eyed my Beamish can).

The aftertaste is bone-dry with some lingering roasted notes and ghost-like english hops.The malt provides enough complexity to balance the flavor and represent the style well, dare I say better than Guinness! It's smooth and easy to drink but has a creamy texture with a dry finish and some roasted flavor holding on. But the carbonation is nearly flat and the body is medium-this makes for a smooth mouthfeel conducive to session beer.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 01, 2006"

What you CAN taste is mostly a roasted coffee and caramel mix with a little of the oaky hint you get from some heavier wines.

The head leaves nice patches of foam/lace throughout - you can see the gulps I've taken - and there is a half inch of head left at the end of the beer. In the nose there is a malty/milky sweetness and some dark fruits (raisins). The flavor is the same but with coffee, chocolate, and a mild hoppiness/bitterness. Both the aroma and the taste is a little subdued. The mouthfeel is par for a nitro can - low carbonation, thin body, smooth, and refreshing. It is quite drinkable due to the low ABV and carbonation, but it is a bit up there in price.

Aromas of roasted barley, black malt, and a touch of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Tastes full of roasteness and moderately malty. The roasted grains give most of flavor: coffee, chocolate, and a burned charcoal bitter. Slightly more roasted than Guinness. Mouthfeel is slick, thick ( because of the nitro) and creamy. Also has a moderate grainy texture and taste. Finishes mildly sweet, bitter, and crisp. Slight powdery finish. Maybe not as dry as it's competitor.

The first flavors I detect are bittersweet chocolate and Turkish coffee with a hint of cookie-like maltiness. Very pleasant. The intensity of the roasted malt flavor increases towards the finish with the cookie/biscuit-like maltiness giving way a slightly astringent roasted malt flavor and fairly intense bitterness that adds to a long finish.

Taste....more roasted malts...trumps Guinness in that the malts actually taste closer to roasted than burnt...some toast, and the slightest hint of barbequed meat. Mouthfeel is what really kills this style for me...flat and watery...but goes down like water as well. Overall, if you have to have an Irish Dry Stout, this trumps Guinness by a hair, but for gods sake there are countless better American stouts to be had.

Taste: Creamy sweetness from the top that falls down into a thin, rusty bitterness, as the sweet creaminess -- this "creaminess" no doubt has everything to do with the mouthfeel, which is unbelievably silky and dense, and lovely -- spreads out in the background.

Sweet barley, roasted barley, bitter dark chocolate, black coffee and some candy. Tastes a bit sweeter than most dry stouts I've had. And the bitterness is due to the coffee and dark chocolate, not the hops. Though their are a bit of hops in this brew. Anyways, starts out sweet and bready, like slightly burnt toast that's been buttered with candy sugar. Then the dark chocolate balances it with a nice bitterness. Aftertaste is a blend of malts and coffee. Great tasting. The rest goes downhill. Mouthfeel was awful. Which is ironic, considering how great the beer is. Too me, it was lighter than water. If air can be drank, it would have the texture of this. Just very, very light. Ruined the beer. Which is sad. It had so many great qualities, only to be ruined by texture. Could the nitro widget have done this? It's a thought. Anyways, I found the mouthfeel so awful I couldn't finish it all. A little less than half the can was dumped into the sand. Too bad. I'd like to try this on tap, without the nitro, to see if that makes a difference in texture. I've heard people say nitro affects taste and mouthfeel, and I have the same beer with and without nitro.

I had Beamish once before at a bar when they ran out of guinness on tap and i was impressed, so i bought some. First off you get the awesome cascading effect of the nitro can and when poured right it will settle a nice pitch black with a small thick head. The smell is slight but pleasant with a hint of roastiness (I'm pretty sure it isn't a word). The taste is nice and mild, once again a mellow roasted taste and some nice maltiness. The head retention is amazing and it almost looks like icrecream atop a rootbeer float. The head laces the glass nicely and the mouthfeel is creamy and delicious. This beer is pretty damn good and if your'e looking for an irish stout via the store I would skip the guinness draught cans and grab this instead. very drinkable.

The head is deep and thick and perfectly symmetrical, and rises to the top as the beer cascades slowly to the bottom of the glass. It's a full pint, so it fits the glass perfectly. The smell is light, of hops only, but the flavor is of roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee, with an aftertaste of bitter chocolate, coffee, hop, and smokey peat. The mouthfeel is silky, and the head leaves rings around the inside of the glass, nearly coating it as it descends. It's a shame I only have one.","far333","May 21, 2003"

While Beamish's nitro can does do a nice job of capturing the draught flavor, the cascade that you get with a Guinness is not the same. The smell of the beer does have an aroma reminiscent of coffee. The flavor is very good and the hints of coffee and chocolate are a pleasure. It is a thin feeling beer in your mouth and thus it does not load down your palate, which makes it highly drinkable. I find it a tad bit smoother than Guinness but loses some of the bitterness. Overall, if the bartender says we're all out of Guinness, how about a Beamish, I'll definitely survive.","BigHead","Mar 26, 2003"

The head was slightly off-white and had a mousse-like texture. The cascading in the glass was also pretty impressive - gotta love that widget. The nose and over all taste was kind of a let down however. Personally I thought the smell was a mix between chalk dust and flat budweiser. It also had a very watery mouthfeel and not much body in the taste - simple chocolate and malt and not much else.

Beautiful, thick, tan pancake head that lingers forever with sparse lacing (probably because I drink the stuff down so fast it doesn't have a chance to stick to the glass). At the bottom of my (ahem!) Guinness pint glass, I still had a 1 1/2" head. Carbonation is mild. Could I tell the difference between Beamish, Murphy's and Guinness in a blind tasting? Sure, but I'd have to cross-train my tastebuds with some malt push-ups and and roasted barley sit-ups. This beer smells rich with roasted grains and coffee, and is probably closer in aroma to Guinness than Murphy's. The mouthfeel is luxuriously smooth, soft, and creamy with a medium body...highly drinkable. Uniquely, this brew has a definite roasted barley graininess, is clean of any metallic overtones, has a slightly more astringent black patent finish and mellower finishing hops. Starts with distinct roasted barley, fades into a mild malt background, and ends with both astringent black patent malt and perfectly balanced, smooth bittering hops. A subtle smoke and cigar ash note is detected towards the finish. Delicious...recommended over Guinness for it's subtle complexity.","Mitchster","Feb 20, 2003"

This was my first experience with the nitro can, I love the fizz that comes out as soon as you pop the top. Aroma was of dark malts and maybe a hint of chocolate, not a real strong aroma. The taste seemed a bit watered down, though it wasn't bad. Roasted malts dominated the taste with a little sweetness. I felt the mouthfeel was the lowpoint of this beer. It seemed to have absolutely no carbonation. It was smooth but the mouthfeel was like water, no it was like skim milk.

It's opaque black with mahogany highlights at the base and collar, and the head is quite impressve: light tan in color, dense and creamy, and astonishingly long lasting - literally lasting to the bottom of the glass! The aroma is lightly fruity and deeply roasty with some mild bittersweet chocolate, some soft dry tobacco, and stale wet coffee grounds. The body is light but appears much fuller due to the intensely creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is roasty from start to finish, but also includes some fruit and nicely sweet malt up front, a very mild caramel note as it warms in the mouth near the finish, and a lingering roast and bitterness. This is clearly milder than the Guinness that it emulates, and I think I find this preferable. It's softer and less bitter, with a touch of chocolate, and much less acidic throughout.

I did not get any peat smoke, as one often finds in dry Irish stouts, but it might have been hiding in the roasted malt flavor.  Flavor was not as roasted as Guinness, and not as assertive as Murphy's.  A bit on the mild side, but very pleasant.

Very mild diacetyl butterscotch is perceptible and complements the chocolate malt flavor.  Fairly full bodied from the use of flaked barley w/ the usual nitro induced super smooth mouthfeel.
