After a while it takes on a wet dog smell, which I can’t say is good. I get a lot more chocolate drinking it than with the aroma. The malt is really roasty, almost burnt-like. There’s a slight hint of bitter coffee, but that’s all. The taste is very nice and more complex than I was expecting. The finish is dry, like an Irish stout should be, but I think there is way too much carbonation in this. I want it to glide down my throat smoothly, but instead my tongue is assaulted by CO2.

3.81,3,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"On-tap at Moeder Lambic on 4/7/2013. Pours a deep brown with light highlights at the base. Head is rocky, 1.5 inches, dense and khaki-colored. The lacing on this beer is incredible and creates a basket weave pattern along the walls of the glass. Nose expresses dark malts, lactose, artificial sweetener, a roasty quality and perhaps a kiss of vanilla. Taste is roasty/earthy with some char, lactose sweetenss and some hops bittering towards the back the lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to light, with an even carbonation - nothing spectacular, but spot on for what it should be.

Light earthy notes comes forth from the smell, as well as cocoa, milk and caramel. Milk chocolate comes in the front of the flavor, followed by a hint of char and bitter coffee (think cafe con leche). Mouthfeel is light and refreshing for a stout, not something one sees very often. Drinkability is superb, even sessionable in many respects. Talk about a stout that is pushing the boundaries in the opposite direction of most. Rather than high ABV and exotic ingredients, De La Senne succeeds with a low alcohol stout that is complex enough on its own.

The yeast is present as a spicy character, a little cinnamon sugar like? Moderately sweetened chocolate is rather prominent here, and swirling the glass brings up some coffee too. Pretty excellent. The palate opens with a prominent, dry, roasty bitterness, moderately grainy. Quite dry, there's no real sweetness here. Cocoa, a little coffee and some roast are all present, as expected, and the yeast character is solid too. Mildly spicy, there's also a light fruitiness present. Drying on the finish, this beer is light in body and has a moderate-high level of carbonation. The finish has a lingering coffee grounds bitterness, coupled with some roasted malt bitterness.

Packs alot of flavor that stronger ales are noted for but with considerably less alcohol. On the brewer's and distributor's websites, this beer is described as a pure version of a classic Belgian stout, made by brewers who are dedicated to making beers using old traditions. This style of beer is often altered to make it more widely appealing using cheap methods, such as nitrogenation or adding spices.

Dark, coffee-colored appearance, but the head dominates, even with its lacking lacing. Aromas have a decent mix of cream, toffee, coffee, burnt sugars. Taste has more of an acidic, bitter fruit taste to it mixed with a milky cream. Like you can see in this review, the creamy aspect is a plus to this drink, but its not overpowering or too off-balanced. Overall, decent.","fitzy84","May 13, 2009"
3.8,2.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D- This beer has a pretty thin flavor with some interesting qualities and a unique hop profile. This beer intrigued me but I'm not sure I could drink to many of them.","rhoadsrage","Apr 22, 2009"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours black with ruby highlights to the edges when held to the light. An offwhite 1/2 finger head sits on top with decent head retention and wispy lacing that is left on the glass. The nose is thick with caramel and roasted malts. There is also a touch of smokiness and roasted coffee notes. Taste is of the roasted and caramel malts, and the burnt/roasted coffee. Touches of molasses in the taste with a mild smokey flavoring. Mouth is slightly chewy with a bitter aftertaste, moderate to high carbonation, lighter bodied than most stouts. This is a highly drinkable stout - especially with the ABV on it.","Jayli","Mar 28, 2009"
3.77,1.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Active carbonation sharp, med-light body. Easily drinkable in just about any weather, which is unusual.","JohnQVegas","Mar 13, 2009"
2.06,-44.3,3,2,2,2,2,"Very thin in the mouth for a dry stout, with little malt backbone evident. Without a maltiness to bring it together, the burnt coffee and smoky taste (perhaps a hint of tobacco) are left sort of hanging isolated and limp. Really is reminiscent of coffee that has been brewed too weakly.","checkfeet","Mar 12, 2009"
4.2,13.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D) I really enjoyed this one. Alcohol is light comparitively, thus welcoming a second round. Okay, why not.","bskrtz","Feb 17, 2009"
3.08,-16.8,4,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Good but could even be better with a little more body to bring balance to the dry taste of roast malt.","schuim","Feb 10, 2009"
3.73,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a bottle at Liquor World in Porter Sq. Poured into a tulip glass. Dark brown color. Heavyset white head. Carbonation really only noticeable at the very bottom of the glass. Decent amount of lacing. Smelled like a lot of roasted barely, with a sprinkle of milk chocolate. Taste was good, not great. Cocoa powder and coffee dominate. Didn't blow me away though. A bit thin in the body, but I have noticed that trend from other Belgian stouts. Very easy to drink, low abv. A bit on the boring side though, but good for one to enjoy.","morebeergood","Jan 16, 2009"
3.92,5.9,3,3.5,4.5,3,4,"Final note: The website says this stout was inspired by the Irish style, but the Belgian in it is still more prevalent. A nice brew on its own.","Jeffo","Jan 07, 2009"

4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is quite a nice beer, the aroma is definitely a bit more interesting / complex than the flavor though. I like that it is dry, and it could almost pass for a ordinary dry stout if not for that hint of fermentation character that makes this a little something extra-ordinary.","Gueuzedude","Dec 01, 2008"
3.8,2.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Far more espresso-like than the smell would indicate. Relatively thin body with a high level of carbonation. The finish is like the end of a dark coffee.","smcolw","Nov 13, 2008"
4.08,10.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice dark brown, almost black color with thin, coffee-colored foam head. Aroma consists of strong maltiness, chocolate, plum and raisin. Nice carbonation with a very smooth taste consisting of hints of dark chocolate, broasted malt and dark fruits.","corby112","Nov 09, 2008"
4.01,8.4,4.5,3.5,4,5,4,"D: A really terrific stout; I recall being very impressed with the taste I had of this at Portland Int'l Beerfest this summer. A little over-bittered for my liking, but definitely one to recommend to fans of the 'Dry Stout' style. Would certainly have again.","msubulldog25","Oct 26, 2008"
3.98,7.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a pretty solid dry stout, which I definitely enjoyed. Different than a typical Irish stout, and I like it. Definitely worth a try.","number1bum","Sep 19, 2008"
2.29,-38.1,4,2.5,2,2.5,2,"d- i'm not really a fan. i think there is a chemical charecter that comes through in this beer, i don't know what would cause this but it just felt flat and had an odd aftertaste.","schroe58","Jul 27, 2008"
3.5,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a light dark color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light bitter roasted malt is somewhat interesting. Taste is also dominated by some light roasted malt and some light hops presence. Good carbonation but body is a bit thin. As previous raters mentioned, this beer seems to be geared toward drinkability and might lack some character.","Phyl21ca","Jul 14, 2008"

4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"33 cl bottle. The beer poured a deep deep brown, nearly black body with a slight tan head that gave way to a little ring on the edge of the glass with some good lacing. There was a pleasing roasted malt aroma. The taste was a nice chocolately and roasted malt base with notes of coffee and a slight hop bitterness on the back. Medium body.","ggaughan","Dec 31, 2007"
4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Deep, deep ruby black color with a huge, creamy head. Strong aroma of roasted malt-almost a peat or charcol aroma. Strong roasted flavor-very strong dark chocolate taste. Quite a grainy flavor as well. Has a touch of earthiness. Nice body for the flavor and lower abv. Finish is rather dry. A different sort of beer and fairly enjoyable.","lackenhauser","Dec 29, 2007"
4.38,18.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours pitch black. No head on my glass, but they usually pour it very well at SD. Thick malty nose. Flavor is a mass of character. Smoky, anise, molasses, thick malts, burnt coffee beans. Throws a load to chew and dwell on in your mouth. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid has a good body as well. Overall very drinkable. Thick and robust with a tolerable bitter tone and aftertaste, it's very well done. Especially considering this is a Belgian produced stout, which we never see that much (and even less, done well).","RblWthACoz","Beers"

4.03,8.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: Despite all of the "porter styled" burnt/bitterness going on here, I found this to be enjoyable and a quite a nice little surprise to bring home from West Lakeview Liquors!","GbVDave","Oct 10, 2007"
3.76,1.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"The bottle says this is a "Brussels Stout". Wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out it's just a good sessionable stout.","joe1510","Oct 03, 2007"
3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Stouterik is a well-brewed dark beer that is more conventional than expected. Unfortunately, the price of admission (I paid $4.09 for the 11.2 oz bottle) is too steep to warrant a repeat purchase. Given the cost, I suggest adding another two or three bucks and leaving with a sixer of some good American stout or porter.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 24, 2007"
3.63,-1.9,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"D: This is a solid stout offering from Belgium. Solid coffee flavor really drives it in general.","YonderWanderer","Aug 10, 2007"
3.87,4.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D/notes: This is the first export stout I have reviewed. Based on this one it seems that they are substantially lighter than other stout styles. Easy drinking except for carbonation.","Nipitato","Aug 07, 2007"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a very fine stout. It pours a very dark, black, slightly frothy head with a decent amount of lacing. The smell is chocolate, burnt malts, and some coffee. This is a medium bodied beer with a bit of sweetness and burnt malts and chocolately flavor. There maybe some coffee here as well, but the coffee dissipates a bit as the beer warms. The beer is decently carbonated, but what makes this a nice warming drink is the medium bodied consistency throughout. There are plenty of hops which balances out the burnt notes quite nicely. You will enjoy a warming aftertaste as well. You can't go wrong here. L'Chaim","albern","Jul 05, 2007"
