Sessionable, but completely forgettable, this is an uninteresting stout that pales in comparison to virtually all craft/imported examples. It has more flavour than the nitrogenated draught can, which may very well scare off the uninitiated, and the overall flavour profile is unlikely to appeal to most BAs given its pedestrian qualities and annoying sweetness. I'll probably use the rest of these bottles in black-and-tan experiments, because I don't know if I have the patience to plow through the rest of them.","thehyperduck","Mar 26, 2014"

3.32,-1.2,3.25,3,3.5,3.5,3.25,"It is a pity that Guinness is basically a synonym for stout. I do not loathe the beer and actually view it as a reasonable session option, which probably sounds insane to beer novices (those novices who know what session means in any event). Seriously, drink more stouts, even other Irish drys, and you will see what I mean. The beer is that light and drinkable in quantity despite being considered the iconic Irish dry stout. Guinness in Canada pours up with a reasonable light mocha head and one is immediately struck by the reddish brown non-opaque appearance, not the black murk one would see with most microbrewed stouts and porters. The aroma is faint chocolate malt, a hint of burnt barley, bread, light roast coffee, a tinge of grape/muscat/random funkiness and little to no hops. The body is surprisingly thin and weak, almost feels like a mainstream Irish red ale like Kilkenny, very smooth and perhaps a tad watery. The taste is more bitter than the aroma but still the hops are subdued and the flavor is burnt toast, dilute dark chocolate, some vinous fruit but again its subtle, and a sweet black tea astringency. There is a touch of the vaunted Guinness sour which probably saves the beer from total mediocrity. If you are a stout fan you want to keep sipping to see what else emerges but alas there not much else and pretty soon the beer is gone. Its not terrible but its not great. Try it to pad your list but look elsewhere for better examples of dry stout.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 27, 2013"

There's definately a hint a chocolate in there, which is a big thing for me when drinking a beer, especially a stout. The rest of the taste just seems like dark roasted malts. So a pretty simple, but a very drinkable beer. If you like something complex or unique, I don't think this will do it for you.

4.15,23.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Guiness extra stout for NA market is brewed just across the border in New Brunswick-- assuming the Moosehead brewery is the NA contractor. I buy one or two bombers/monthly even though the craft stout market is strong here. The appearance is dark color with a large head that pillows. clumps and laces. Smell is of dark roasted malt and hops. Taste is of the heavy roast malts, dark coffee/chocolate undertones and hops. Mouthfeel is medium and crisper than some. Overall I still very much appreciate a guinness extra stout even though it is "macro" for practical purposes. The fact it is brewed just up the way makes me think the stock is a bit fresher here.","adjunctjonez","Mar 28, 2012"

Small streaks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt and some slight roast and fruity aromas. Taste is of roasted malt, burnt sugar, and some fruity flavors. There is a somewhat assertive roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate long after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average stout that is really roasty and bitter. Nothing I would go for again.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 28, 2012"

A one and a half-inch head of a light tannish head caps the brew, leaving a moderate lace throughout. As expected, rich roasted malt aromas dominate, with hints of chocolate and coffee, just hints. This brew was much sweeter then expected. As you may have noticed, Stouts do not get their fair share of ratings on our page, yet whenever we do get the chance to share them with you, we are always pleasantly surprised. Extra stout brings flavors of rich coffee, chocolate, sweet and smoky malt, and slight hop bitterness to the pallet. Lighter in carbonation, the brew features an amazingly smooth mouthfeel, and is medium-high in body. Sip and enjoy the flavors and history of this World-famous brew!","phishsihq","Mar 03, 2012"
