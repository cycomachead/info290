4.1,-0.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"This beer has its act together. Beautiful colour, substantial lingering head, sweet aroma of dark fruit and hard candy. This really is like fruitcake in a glass. Caramel malt, dark bread, cherry and plum are all prominent in the flavour profile. I love the overall packaging and complexity of this beer. Once again, Fuller's shows exactly how to craft a multi layered, substantial ale.","Bunman3","Feb 19, 2015"

4.52,10,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall-  This beer has a lot going on with a great interplay of flavors ranging from the spicy hop finish to the toasted malt, and fruity esters from the yeast.  Hands down a great, even amazing, beer in my books and one I will be seeking out again.","CTbrew32","Feb 15, 2015"

4.01,-2.4,4.25,3.75,4.25,3.5,4,"Very good beer which has a few notes that are a bit off.  The earthy tastes don't blend well.  Would prefer a sweeter aftertaste more like the more prominent flavors rather than the bitterness I pickup.  A bit less carbonation would be nice as well.","leroybrown10","Jan 10, 2015"

4.22,2.7,4.75,4,4.25,3.75,4.5,"Poured an almost muddy tan to start with but then cleared a little and was more of a caramel.  Nice fluffy head that dissipated slowly and then left a very nice lacing that stuck around as I drank the beer.  Outstanding looking beer, I dare say beautiful.  The smell is not overly strong, there appears to be some caramel with the malt smell, and there seems to be some dark fruit of some sort.  Taste is outstanding but not overly complex.  An easy and very smooth drinking strong ale but lacks wow.  More of a lighter version of strong ales.  The feel is also kinda light, not real creamy or thick, it also leaves you kinda dry which is weird.  Overall an extremely enjoyable beer that I would have anytime.  Don't remember the cost as to whether it was a good value.","JamieDuncan","Dec 27, 2014"
