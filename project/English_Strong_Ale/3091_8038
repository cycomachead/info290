3.85,2.9,4,4,3.75,3.5,4,"An interesting and overall very enjoyable strong ale. There is a slight hint of tannins and phenolics in the flavor although it doesn't detract from things. Very much a dark malt and alcohol focused beer without any heavy-handed residual sugars or excessive booziness. The body is a little bit on the weak side but shouldn't matter to most folks as the appeal to the other senses is solid.","beergoot","Oct 13, 2014"
