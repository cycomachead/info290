3.89,6.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark brown with som ruby highlights near the bottom of the pint glass. Thin, off-white head that dissipates quickly. Lots of sediment which was hard to avoid pouring. Dark, roasted malt aroma with some caramel notes as well as raisin and licorice undertones, and a whiff of ethanol. The flavor is malty, featuring more roasted malts adding a hint of chocolate and caramel. Little to no hop presence. Medium body, bordering on being slightly thin or watery.","goldbot","May 13, 2010"
3.87,6,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall / Drinkability: I wonder if this would best on cask rather than in a bottle. It's tasty, smells interesting, and overall, I could see myself having another one - a full pint no less.","damndirtyape","Jan 22, 2010"
4.21,15.3,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"O. so complex yet very drinkable. i cant wait to try it at Daleside.","dirkchivers","Nov 03, 2009"
3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pleasantly surpised by this beer. Maybe not as good as Stingo or Geary's, but definately worth a try.","morimech","Jun 21, 2009"
3.65,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Certainly a drinkable brew, but definitely unique in that I didn't think a lighter alcohol version of an ale existed which had the same characteristics as usually much darker stouts/porters.","thekanna","Apr 10, 2009"
3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The body was pleasantly full without being heavy or filling. Drinkability was very nice, smooth and easy. Overall, a nice easy brew that's worth your time.","beertunes","Dec 12, 2008"
3.38,-7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Quite a lot of body on it, but it does feel a bit thin right at the back, and incredibly drying. It feels like a big hangover-inducing beer.","laituegonflable","Nov 30, 2008"
3.45,-5.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"D: I don't understand this beer. It has a ton of flavors, but they're not necessarily the best. I'm pretty bored of it already, and don't anticipate having it again. Its flavor combination is remarkable, but nonetheless off-putting. Given the amount of soy sauce and ginger, I can only imagine how this beer would taste with sushi.","dudecandle","Sep 07, 2008"
3.73,2.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I wouldn't classify this as an English Strong Ale, not at 5.5% ABV and with no real strong alcohol presence. I didn't take notes why sampling the beer last night, but two words pretty much define the beer, the first is ginger and the other is caramel malts. Put the two together, with some modest carbonation, some complex sweet malts, a bit of leafy hop in the finish, and this is the beer in a nutshell. It is a nice, complex, enjoyable beer that I will re-review in order to write a fuller, more comprehensive review at a later time.","albern","Aug 09, 2008"
3.32,-9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The aroma is sweet. It's got toasted malt, cola, soy/A1 sauce, spices/herbs, ginger, and fruit. The appearance is deep amber with a small head. The flavor is like the the aroma but has a papery finish. The palate is thin. Overall it's quite interesting but not great.","nick76",
