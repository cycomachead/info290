4.69,24.1,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Vanilla, spice, and a faint sherry note first engage the nose, and then light hop aromas, malt and slight caramel with a hint of fruit become more apparent. It pours brilliant copper amber under a fluffy 1‚Äù off white foam cap. The palate really highlights the oak in a masterful way with vanilla, a slight mustiness that suggests a bourbon with considerably less alcohol. Behind this lurks a nutty, graham cracker, fruity ESB flavors. Above average carbonation also masks the ESB qualities a little bit as does a creamy texture. The body is just above medium. Almost like a jazz riff on an ESB.","pat61","Sep 01, 2014"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a nice, white head that borders between creamy and bubbly. The beer itself is a dark copper that borders on brown and is clear. The beer has very strong oak notes when it's cold but the vanilla beans really come through and work well with the oak, which gives a bit a of a nice spicy note to it. The malts come out but not as strongly and give an interesting sweetness to the bouquet. The taste is similar to the smell notes but that the oak is much stronger than the vanilla bean and the malts are fairly sweet. The notes combine to give off a roasted coconut taste, which is pretty good. The mouthfeel is very soft and smooth with biting carbonation. Overall, a very good and unique beer; one that I will definitely pick up.","HattedClassic","May 26, 2014"
