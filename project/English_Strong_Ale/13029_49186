3.28,-22.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of dry fruits with dry toffee notes are quite unique and quite strong. Taste is a strange mix between some dry toffee notes with caramel malt with some molasses notes with some light fruity ester and some chestnut. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very complex beer with maybe a tad too much going on.","Phyl21ca","Apr 21, 2012"
4.05,-4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"OVERALL: This one was really tough to score. It’s very unique and extremely flavorful, with lots going on and plenty to contemplate, but the aggressiveness does make it somewhat difficult to enjoy an entire half litre yourself. Perhaps this is something better off shared with a buddy. Regardless, this brew has definitely made me interesting in trying more of their stuff. Very impressive. If the opportunity arises, don’t pass this one up. Highly recommended.","Jeffo","Apr 21, 2012"

4.23,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Deep black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and great lacing. Very unique roasty, nutty, and subtly sweet nose with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, licorice, molasses and peat. The taste is complex and unique. A lot going on that I've never experienced. Lots of roasty espresso and dark chocolate along with hints of dark fruit, specifically black cherries, licorice, peat, tobacco, and hazelnuts. There's something else in there that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it's the chestnut honey, which I'm unfamiliar with. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and oily with a bittersweet finish. Very smooth and drinkable for a 10% beer. It's a little expensive, but definitely another unique and great offering from Thornbridge!","beerdrifter","Mar 16, 2012"

4.28,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - I've been in a English sort of mood, having had this and Courage RIS on back-to-back days. This doesn't have the brett character of the Courage, but it's got that well-attenuated dryness and quintessential English character to it in spades. Unique and somewhat hard to categorize - more of a smoked beer than a strong ale or stout, but with elements of all of them. I was initially slightly turned off by the aroma, but this grew on me quite a bit over the course of a half-liter (yes, I drank it all by myself). Pricey, challenging, but ultimately rewarding.","MasterSki","Jan 01, 2012"

4.2,-0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall pretty good, the only issue I see is the peat smoke always gives it a weird flavor, the more beer I have with peat smoke the more I don't like it in beer (and I'm a peat-o-phile when it comes to scotch), but nice flavors otherwise, great dark malts, oats, light nuts and spices, chocolate and roast, the sawdust flavor I think comes from the peat smoke but not sure, which is also not the best flavor, if regular smoked malts instead of peat I think this would be an A.","jlindros","Feb 23, 2010"

Aroma is licorice, black malts, and an odd note that took me forever to figure out but that I believe is soy sauce (I wrote 'fishy' in my initial notes, but that's not quite it). Flavor is much better, with tons of roast and vivid dark chocolate. Peat is mild, and I don't really get any honey. Caramel and chalk make an appearance. Thick, bitter, and dry.","illidurit","Apr 16, 2009"

There's a long, espresso aftertaste. Hot damn, this is good beer. There's a paler malt notes that pop up in the aftertaste, but there's a whole lot of roasted malt going on that dives into roast chestnuts, honey, and spicy British hops. Delicious.","tempest","0"
