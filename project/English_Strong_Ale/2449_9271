3.26,-10.9,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Overall - Not a bad beer for $2.00. However, it didn't leave me wanting another. Isn't that the sign of a good beer, you can't wait to crack open the next one? This isn't that, I'm just trying to decide who to pawn my other one off to. I think the prevailing sourness in the mouth the the loss of head after a few seconds diminished the beer's complexity. Also, I have no idea how long it was shelved before finding its way to the discount rack. Perhaps fresher ones are a completely different story.","Freggs","Apr 08, 2010"

3.31,-9.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Conclusion: If I was a betting man, I'd say this has probably been sitting around for quite some time. Nevertheless, I can only rate it as I'm tasting it. There's nothing really "wrong" with it, it's just a rather boring ale in that nothing stands out and the fruitiness is a bit much for me.","BedetheVenerable","Feb 09, 2008"
3.07,-16.1,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The aroma is nice, it's sweet and malty with caramel, flowers, and fruit. The appearance is amber with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma but acidic and papery. The palate is thin. Overall it's nothing special. I would probably pass if offered another.","nick76","Dec 21, 2007"
3.97,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear copper with a small tan head. The nose promises plenty of big malts to come, along with citrusy hops. Love the taste: semi-sweet malts that are almost spicy, with a light hoppiness that keeps the attention on the toasty and biscuity qualities of the malts. Medium bodied, very drinkable as a session ale. Well worth the $3.50 I paid for the bottle.","droomyster","Dec 16, 2007"

4.22,15.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"500ml brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a translucent lighter amber body with virtually no head to speak of. Smells malty with a strong herbal hop presence. Tastes sweet and malty, with caramel, nut, and roast playing parts, with a good portion of herbal English hops, especially in the finish. An easy drinker for sure - light on the palate with a small amount of carbonation. Tasty and refreshing. Subtle flavors and qualities contributing their part in perfect portion. Everything I'd expect from a well-crafted English ale. At 5$ per bottle, this would not be an everyday treat for me. Nonetheless, it's by far the finest English beer I've had in some time, and I find nothing wrong with it.","MrHurmateeowish","Apr 19, 2007"
3.73,1.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: A decent enough English strong but there are other examples of the style I would prefer; too much mineral content and diacetyl for my tastebuds","brentk56","Nov 12, 2006"
3.32,-9.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Re-review June 2009: The beer is thin, a bit tart from some leafy hop notes, a tad lemony, a little sourish, and all of the above are true, but the beer deserves better than a C. I'm going to up the taste and nose of the beer which has a touch of diacetyl and toffee notes. The beer is just okay, but I'm a little more generous after trying it again.","albern","Sep 13, 2006"
3.58,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer poured a rich gold or light amber with a thin white head. It had a rich malty aroma with a hint of hops. The taste was of malt with a good hop finish. The feel was light and dry. A solid ale, but not very complex. The hopping was a bit on the bitter side, not much floral to it. Decent, but not one I'd search out.","claytri","Aug 23, 2006"

3.8,3.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Interesting. Clear, light amber in color with a decent amount of carbonation and a thin head that doesn't leave much if any lacing. Smells of faint hops with more fruity, malty undertones coming up than anything. Clean, thirst quenching taste that is pretty darn good in my book. Some English hops are evident and well-balanced by a sweet, malty finish. Somewhat thinner mouthfeel though it was very smooth and silky considering. I'd say this one is quite drinkable even though it's on the high ABV end for it's style. Drinks much easier than you'd think. Daleside seems to make some quality stuff and this one is no exception.","ncvbc","Mar 31, 2006"
3.95,7.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Standard English Pale Ale. A nice caramel / earthy, grassy aroma up front, with fruitiness and sweetness. A nearly clear golden color with nice retention and lacing. Smells malty and fruity (oranges and apricots) with a light hop spicy flavor and good bitter balance. A bit heavy and oily to the mouth keeps it from being as refreshing as it should be, but a good feel otherwise. Finishes with empahasis on the fruity sweetness and hop spiciness.","BEERchitect",
