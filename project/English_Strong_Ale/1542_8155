3.88,15.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Quite a nicely put together ale. Reasonably dear at AU$80 a case (2012), but I think this one is worth it.","SmashPants","May 08, 2011"

3.22,-4.2,3,3.5,3,4,3,"Food match: Again I'm going off what the ale was like when I first drank it: rich foods like roast lamb, beef, venison with heavy gravy's and Lyonnaise potatoes with Yorkshire puddings and glazed carrots.","doktorhops","Jul 06, 2010"
3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Good, though not exceptional brew to start off the evening. Probably not one I'd return to very often if I were lucky enough to frequent this Sydney institution, but certainly worthy of a good pint every now and then.","JohnnyBarman","Nov 27, 2009"
3.14,-6.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Malt driven amber ale style. Lightish chocolate tan in colour. Reasonably fizzy palate keeps the weight surprisingly light for a 6.7% beer. Malty chocolate notes come across the palate really well. Very appealing beer. Best of the marque in my opinion.","Stew41","Oct 07, 2009"
4.12,22.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"If you ever been to Aussie then you understand the above as a common response to most questions. Anyway....the Old Admiral is a nice, tasty beer. Not to strong, but noticeable. The aroma is sweet, malty, and caramelly. Color is a dark amber with nice white head. The taste is ever bit what the aroma was hinting. A very good beer with red meat. I would give this beer a go at a session...why not!!! Cheers Mate!","WoodBrew","Sep 24, 2009"
