3.88,15.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Quite a nicely put together ale. Reasonably dear at AU$80 a case (2012), but I think this one is worth it.","SmashPants","Feb 02, 2012"

3.22,-4.2,3,3.5,3,4,3,"Food match: Again I'm going off what the ale was like when I first drank it: rich foods like roast lamb, beef, venison with heavy gravy's and Lyonnaise potatoes with Yorkshire puddings and glazed carrots.","doktorhops","May 08, 2011"
3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Good, though not exceptional brew to start off the evening. Probably not one I'd return to very often if I were lucky enough to frequent this Sydney institution, but certainly worthy of a good pint every now and then.","JohnnyBarman","Feb 14, 2011"
3.14,-6.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Malt driven amber ale style. Lightish chocolate tan in colour. Reasonably fizzy palate keeps the weight surprisingly light for a 6.7% beer. Malty chocolate notes come across the palate really well. Very appealing beer. Best of the marque in my opinion.","Stew41","Nov 20, 2010"
4.12,22.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"If you ever been to Aussie then you understand the above as a common response to most questions. Anyway....the Old Admiral is a nice, tasty beer. Not to strong, but noticeable. The aroma is sweet, malty, and caramelly. Color is a dark amber with nice white head. The taste is ever bit what the aroma was hinting. A very good beer with red meat. I would give this beer a go at a session...why not!!! Cheers Mate!","WoodBrew","Jul 05, 2010"
3.45,2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: This was an ok beer and I did have two both before and during dinner. That said even if I were still in Sydney I'd not go out of my way to have this one again.","drtth","Nov 27, 2009"
3.45,2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Carbonation is too high for the flavours in my opinion.","CrazyDavros","Oct 06, 2009"
3.03,-9.8,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"D-- One 6 pack is enough. Not again. Reminds me of a homebrew with a lot of sugar. Once the beer sits in you for a while a really sweet taste begins and it is like being a kid who has had too much candy on halloween. Has a really nice look and smell but after that if goes downhill quick.","mulder1010","Sep 24, 2009"
3.11,-7.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Another craft brewed Australian beer that fails to win me over. Lots of flavour, full of character, but I suppose I have been spoiled by drinking real ales in England. This is far from a bad beer, and it is streets ahead of what most people are drinking in Australia (VB, TED, Corona etc), but still falls well short of the international benchmarks, not to mention offerings from Little Creatures, James Squire etc.","LittleCreature","Sep 09, 2009"
3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- This beer has some nice flavor but they are a bit thin.","rhoadsrage","Beers"
3.73,11,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a dark copper hue with average carbonation that leaves a half finger head with subtle lacing,it has aromas of burnt toffee,roasted malts and dried fruits,it has an above average mouthfeel with a toffee taste first up followed by some roasted malts with a nice touch of hop bitterness towards the end,a very well balanced beer and could easliy drink a few of these.","ADZA","0"
3.46,3,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"i missed the lord nelson on a trip to sydney a while back. this beer makes me want to be certain to get to the pub on my next trip. this would be a must try on tap.","joecast","Jan 10, 2008"
2.95,-12.2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Note almost seems like an Old Ale and certainly a night cap for my evening.","TubaManJack","Nov 29, 2007"

3.33,-0.9,3.5,3,4,3,2.5,"I've had this on tap over the years through a few different brewers and recipes. The first release in the bottle was disappointing but I have to say that the latest bottled batch lives up to the memories of the best on tap at the Lord. Bottled conditioned, hazelnut brown in colour with an off white head. Great nutty English ale yeast nose with roasted malt. Great balance of hops and toasted malt flavour. A bit heavy to be really sessional but I never drank Old Admiral to be social....","rizzo","Dec 13, 2006"
3.33,-0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The bottle is 6.1%.","vancurly","Nov 16, 2006"
3.41,1.5,3.5,2.5,4,4,3,"Big malty character in this brew. It's really chewable. Rather pleasant. There is a high sugar taste that makes it a little less enjoyable as you continue. I wonder what the final gravity is.","dwarbi","Aug 17, 2006"
3.22,-4.2,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"As it stands, it's a reasonable dark ale, but little more than average.","lacqueredmouse","Jun 03, 2006"

3.91,16.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I quite enjoyed this beer. Could be a bit stronger on the malt but again you cant falt to balance of these brewed they are very decent!","Finite","Jan 19, 2003"
2.98,-11.3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is slightly sweet with some caramel and grainyness with some toffee mixed in as well. I also get some earthy hops that I couldnt find on the nose. the beer finishes clean but a little empty. The beer is decent but a bit of a letdown. Still worth swingin by as they have others on tap to try.","sulldaddy","Beers"
2.2,-34.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Has a bit of body, but the watery characteristics are there in the finish, a bit of roastiness, not enough. Hints of coffee, caramel, chocolate, but not well noticed, some mollasses, but generally has a sweet watery texture. Not really too pleasant to drink, no enough balance and flavour.","rastaman","0"
