3.75,11.6,,,,,,"Pours a bright orange color with little head that fizzes away pretty clean. The smell was slightly sour with a cherry scent to it. The taste was interesting with alcohol burn in the beginning and mellowing out into sour cherries and orange peel. Could have used a bit more balanced but made for a nice dessert beer.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 14, 2014"
