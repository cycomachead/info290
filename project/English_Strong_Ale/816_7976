At that time Peculiar was about as rich and complex as beer got in Toronto - how far we've come. Sadly, while I still maintain fond memories of this Old Ale, it hasn't translated well from cask to the bottle.","biegaman","Feb 18, 2014"

3.86,1.6,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.5,3.75,"Clear-reddish brown colour, one finger of white head, some lace. Smell i s a nice mix of toasted grainy malts, fruity with a bit of nutty chocolate, light roast, biscuity with a little floral-fruity hops. Taste is malty with toasty grains, light hop bitterness. Lightly carbonated, light-medium body. This is pretty good but not terribly interesting though, would not pass up if offered but not somethign worth seeking out.","peensteen","May 06, 2012"
