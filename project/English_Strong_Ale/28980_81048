4.35,17.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours a hazy amber to a very dark almost ruby black color. Head builds to excellent level and shows good lacing retention. Some carbonation can be seen towards the bottom where the color is lightest. Smells of fresh biscuits, caramel, and faint Scotch like alcohol scents. Mouth is all malted bread and caramel. Good alcohol bite at the mid=palate with light hop notes. A little bitter on the back side of the flavor profile. Just enough to let you know there is some hops there. Whiskey barrel flavors of smoke, leather, and oak linger. Not sure where that comes from but it's pleasant and complimentary. Very good. 4.25 out of 5.","digitalflood","Feb 23, 2015"
