4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/27/2010. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, raisin, plum, light cocoa, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, light nuttiness, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, toffee, molasses, raisin, plum, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding English porter style. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. This held up very well for it’s age considering the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 03, 2015"

3.99,0.5,2,4.25,4.5,3,3.75,"Pours an opaque dark brown similar to a stout, but not black.  Well below average head, lacing and retention.  Outstanding nose of dark fruit (plum, fig), sweet chocolate, slightly burnt molasses and just a hint of alcohol.  The nose is similar to that of an Olde or Scott Ale, but lighter - as is the flavor profile.  Light medium body with a hint of slickness.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, very complex and masterfully balanced.  The beginning to middle is a blend of flavors that slowly fade allowing subsequent identification.  All flavors of the nose are present and basically cascade from burnt molasses to dark fruit and then into a light bitterness followed by a chocolate note and associated sweetness.   The finish is a slow fade of malty sweetness with a hint of alcohol and a bit of hop and alcohol bite.","tillmac62","Nov 13, 2014"

4.19,5.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"This is a somewhat unique brew (or at least the style is). Not sweet like an English Barleywine (such as the superb J.W. Lees Harvest Ale). Not bitter like an ESB. And nothing like an English porter or stout, although it looks like a stout. It starts just a little hoppy or sweet but grows in complexity and fruity and wine characteristics as it warms. In fact it gets better and better as it goes down. Another excellent offering from a superb brewery.","Beer-A-Lot","Feb 25, 2014"
