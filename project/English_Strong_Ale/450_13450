3.48,-7.4,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,"This is quite a strong ale.  I can't get a grasp on the style?  I guess it is sort of a Belgian golden/pale ale.  Great looking pour with a nice two finger head and golden to copper body.  Scents of esters of apple and alcohol.  Maybe some pears?  Medium bodied with again, a Belgian golden mouth feel.  Pears, apples, and apricot. The drawback is a huge alcohol kick back that is quite noticeable but not unpleasant.  The deist, Thomas Jefferson, who supposedly crafted this beer in the 1700's, must have had quite a high tolerance to consider this one a "tavern ale".  Worth But still, worth a shot.","bigdeuce","Mar 16, 2015"
