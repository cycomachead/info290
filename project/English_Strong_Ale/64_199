The smoke is beautifully present yet subtle. The beer is a work of art at this point in its age. It's a 5 at this point.","Severdali","Dec 22, 2014"

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz bottle 2012 aged one year. Pours a slight cloudy rich copper amber with a quickly fading razor thin head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, yeast, fruity some toasted vanilla oaked essence and dark fruit and mild maple notes, some smokey notes as well. Taste the same as aroma with a bit of earthy herbal hops bitterness and a bit of brandy like notes in the flavor. The palate is a full and rich and smooth with moderate carbonation and there is some bubble effervescence. Finish is the same as taste with some smoked flavors as it warms up with a lingering brandy like sweetness and mild bitterness on the end. Not as sweet as some other barley wines as this is labeled but very good. Overall a very good smooth and easy drinking and pleasant bw. Very nice, I feel immortal already. enjoy","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

On the plus side, this beer is unlike any other, and has some notes that would be highly appealing to a certain crowd (liking peat in your whiskey is a good start). On the bad side, there is not much to compel another immediate swig (again, whiskey sippers might feel at home). I could barely detect anything but smoke and alcohol, certainly not the luscious (from the label) beer I was expecting. Good as part of a flight, but hard to finish by oneself.

Quite a bit of boozey alcohol on the nose too. I got huge maple in the taste, but it is not overly sweet. Vanilla, smoke and a hit of black pepper spice linger. Feel is actually pretty light-bodied considering the style and ABV. A touch syrupy maybe, but not bad. Moderate - light carbonation that amplifies the subtle spice. Overall another crazy unique beer from DFH and one that for me falls in the middle of the success spectrum. Good flavors, and it's nice to see maple as a major player.

Not a beer to drink quickly IMHO, but one to linger with and sip slowly. Felt it had more maple character than many beers claiming maple as a key flavor. One to have on hand for a chilly evening. Did not have fresh, so can't compare but I don't think the age hurt this beer at all and it would hold up well for even longer than the year I had it stored.","LeRose","Nov 25, 2013"

4.1,7.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2013A. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, smoke, clove, oak, vanilla, maple syrup, raisin, brown bread, light nuttiness, juniper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, raisin, smoke, nuttiness, oak, clove, vanilla, maple syrup, herbal, juniper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, smoke, brown bread, nuttiness, oak, clove, vanilla, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; with big malt robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced strong ale! All around great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; and dangerously smooth to sip on for 11%. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 06, 2013"

After drinking several sips and allowing it to breathe, my husband and I did not want to waste what money we put into it, so we just downed it. Not an enjoyable beer.","bmjivi221","Jul 16, 2013"

The peat-smoked barley and vanilla standout in the nose, but they do not overshadow hints of maple, caramel, and alcohol. The smokiness leads on the palate with the richer malt flavors of caramel and toasted biscuits joining in to simmer down the smokiness. As the beer warms, maple and vanilla flavors begin to become more assertive, s well as a nice little hop profile in the finish. Lighter in carbonation, this 11%er has a fairly heavy mouthfeel.

Well, I was expecting this beer to be a complete convoluted mess with all of the ingredients that were used in crafting this massive ale, but it turned out to be artfully balanced with hardly any alcohol presence at all! With an 11% beer, that is pretty hard to do. All of the components shine through very well in the this beer and come to a very nice crescendo in the finish. I'm looking forward to cellaring a few bottles of this to see how the ale develops over time. Highly recommended for a curious drinker who doesn't mind a big, sweet and contemplative ale.","flayedandskinned","Apr 15, 2013"

I was a little excited to see something new I haven't had before from this brewery, but unfortunately, this beer wasn't for me. Too much smokiness, and the maple flavors didn't fit well, along with slight traces of vanilla. Not the easiest beer to put down, as it should for the ABV for this brew. Maybe next time Dogfish Head can put out something that is drinkable. I highly doubt I would have this beer again, and most likely would not recommend to a friend. Cheers!","DMXLOX22","Mar 27, 2013"

Deep amber in color, with light lacing and a minimal head retention, this limited edition gives off aromas that are oaky, "cookout"esque (bacon, maple, hickory), with a sweet overtone. Loads of maple and brown sugar coat the palate, while smoke, raisins, and hickory accompany. With this weighing in at 11% alcohol, one can hardly taste it as it is very creamy and oily.

Taste is much of the same smoke, malt, caramel with a sticky sweet finish. Warming from the booze, but only faintly noticed on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice tight bubbled carbonation. Probably the highlight of this beer. Not my favorite in the DFH lineup but still a solid brew and at about 3/4 of the way through the stealthy 11% is catching up. Very well hidden alcohol.","Kevlee722","Aug 28, 2012"

Very odd flavor at first. Starts with dark fruit, vanilla, odd ester flavors, confusing at first but interesting. Wood, light smoke, peat and fruit take over with a woody, boozy, estery finish. Not very balanced and unusually flavored, but I kept wanting another taste. Medium to heavy body with some creaminess.","LiquidAmber","Aug 03, 2012"

The oak is quite noticeable and a nice chocolatey, roasty malt backs this up well. Hints of cherry with an herbal and piney hop presence. However there is an intense phenolic/doctor's office/medicinal component overarching all else which really detracts from the rest. The flavor brings out more oak with a smoky, intense, roasted malt profile. The phenols are there but less noticeable, blending in a bit and covered up with some ethanol warmth on the throat. Nicely bitter. A lot going on in this beer but I feel like it is pretty mixed up and its quite rough even after a few months in the bottle.

The taste contains the same notes but the flavors mix differently. The taste is bit more hop forward mixed with the maple syrup. The vanilla notes complement the hops and maple while the oak adds a bit of spice to the mixture. The mouthfeel is full bodied but smooth and not very thick.

It's also very sweet which hurts the drinkability but this is a sipper beer for sure. The 11% alcohol also gives it a big kick.

There is an effervescent feel to the nose, as well. The beer's flavors are dark roasted, with a fig and date sweetness, some nutty character, and a hint of chocolate. The booze carries over into the aftertaste, with a good dash of spicing (maybe all spice?) and the sweet undertones to balance.

What I like most about this beer was pretty much everything, it had a good amount of flavors and complexity, and it looked good and had great drinkability. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of maple syrup and vanilla notes, they were there but they were pretty light. I would buy this beer again for a special occasion but the price and availability would prevent me from drinking this often. I recommend giving this beer a try, it's a little unique and goes down smooth. Dogfish Head did a good job with this beer and it made for a good choice for my 300th review, it's been fun trying all these beers and with crazy beers from these guys and Short's it makes it even better.

3.7,-3.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This pours the color of a semi-precious stone -- dark and somewhat translucent amber but with a tawny seam when held up to the light -- and possessive of a dense, creamy and blatantly cascading head that proves itself fairly resilient, maintaining its breadth even three quarters of the way through. Nose is astonishingly sweet; and while there are some traces of wood and warm esters present, the notes of vanilla and roasted sugar are so pronounced that the ultimate aroma is explicitly of cotton candy. Thankfully, the taste does not proceed in this crushingly candied wake. Upfront is all oak and fruit. Yes, the juniper holds sway but there are also some grape and pear characteristics as well as an undercurrent of smoke/must. Here, the vanilla and maple act as complements (rather than forthright, obvious components) to great effect, significantly deepening the total sensory actuality. The finish is another surprise, super smooth and almost entirely comprised of vanilla. The mouthfeel is rich, yeasty, appropriately carbonated and rather lovely. Overall, this is an extremely daring and extremely complex beer with entirely too many ingredients that manage to thread themselves into an utterly fascinating and indecisive amalgamation.

Much like the nose a lot of the same qualities come through on the tongue. The mouthfeel was smooth and semi thick with a good carbonation to it. Overall this beer is a powerhouse.

This is a luscious brew, and exactly what I was in the mood for tonight. Mouthfeel- creamy, still well carbonated, just really smooth.

The taste is like a scotch ale with that smoked barley taste and hints of oak maple and vanilla just like the bottle says! I cannot believe how well this 11% is masked. It has a bit of a thick kind of syrupy mouthfeel but what do you expect they put maple syrup in it! I can even taste the vine like hops in the background. I'd like to try this fresh to see how those hops are... since obviously they have subdued because of the age. I just can't believe I'm never let down by this brewery.

Smells of raisins, a lot of raisins, pretty detectable alcohol smell as well but it's not overpowering. Tastes pretty sweet, malty with vanilla and alcohol is present as well, much the same as the smell, there is also some oak tucked away here with a sour aftertaste which was unexpected. Medium bodied with little carbonation. Definitely a sipper but an easy sipper though, goes down very smooth. Worth the money in my opinion.","Darien","Jun 16, 2010"

A sweet maple/brown sugar aroma too. This is almost like a barrel aged English barleywine, but not quite. There is a raisiny character to it as well. Taste is, however, somewhat lacking compared to the nose. Alcohol is prominent with all the complexities somewhat subdued, although there is a chocolatey robustness coming around the raisins. Lots of maple. Perhaps a bit too much? Slick and big body with moderate carbonation. Hot finish. I'd let this sit for a while.","DmanGTR","Jun 14, 2010"

Full-bodied, thickly layered, not sloth-like, however, nowhere near nimble. The tar, charcoal, peat, damp black earth components overwhelming here, it's like being passed through a filter. That said, honey, molasses, caramel not shy about taking the stage either. Let's call them the "earthy" qualities, whatever they are, they chain up the apricot, cherry, banana fruit flavors although these are in no way evanescent.

Like most Dogfish beers, it has a sweetness to it that I really kind of like, a lot of kick, just the right amount of hops, all around great beer. The only thing keeping me from buying it every time I go there is the price. At $11 a bottle, it's right up there with their 120 in price, and I still feel that is a better beer.

The taste is pretty similar, with notes of raisins, whiskey (it's back), molasses, brown sugar, nutmeg, and stainless steel (ever lick a spoon?).

I'm not usually a huge fan of smoked malts, but they're welcome here because it's something that's not alcoholic heat. As with the nose, the maple and bourbon mentioned on the bottle are ancillary flavors. The beer is nicely carbonated, but the body is a little too thin for such a big beer. Any beer this overtly boozy is going to be a slow sipper, and right now I'm feeling glad that I only picked up one bottle instead of a four pack.","axeman9182","May 19, 2010"

There is a decent amount of smoke taste on the beer too. The taste is not my style. Mouthfeel is good, creamy and medium with a bit of alcohol warming and good carbonation.

The aroma was of oak, caramel malt, sweet malt, chocolate malt, alcohol esters, alcohol heat, raisins, dark fruit and light spices. The flavors were quite sweet but not cloying and surprisingly clean. I tasted chocolate and caramel malt, raisins, figs and dark fruit a slight hop bitterness and a little peat smoke on the end. Quite malty but not misbalanced and the sweetness hid the alcohol quite well. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation soft.

The 07 is much more integrated, with a smoky, more refined wood characteristic. The brown sugary malt sweetness comes out to play a bit more as well. For sure, it is a beer that ages gracefully.

That banana-oakey flavor blends very nicely with the vanilla, making for a very smootjh drink. Sort of a smokey but sweet, burnt-malt but still smooth thing going on. Very woodey, got a slight bit of tobacco going on, like an old ale-lite. Full bodied, mouthfeel just doesn't envelop quite as well as it could. Still, despite the high ABV and so many things going on, extremely drinkable. Not as nice on the senses and not quite as tasty/complex as Palo Santo, this is still an excellent beer. As a sipper, I could sip on this forever.","damienblack","May 19, 2009"

The aftertaste is maple syrup, softened by the juniper berries. Unfortunately, I my response was "that was good, but I'll have a 75". I couldn't drink a whole pint - but it was tasty and interesting.

A bit boozy. The taste is of maple sweetness and earthy oak, which intermingle nicely, the vanilla chimes in at times. Perhaps a touch rough at the ends and boozy. There is enough of a bitter hop to add some balance. Moderate feel, lightly chewy, nice carbonation. Definitely hot with the ABV, could use some mellowing.

Taste is consistent with nose but some dark sugar is also present in the mix, and a little bit of vanilla and maple syrup comes out as the brew warms.

For me this is an easy drinking beer, sure were I to try to session it I'd get fucked up, but that doesn't mean that its any less drinkable.

Roasted, toasted, carame, burnt chocolate malt sensations hit my tongue as it passes for a sweet and perplexing taste and the minor hop presence balances it out for a drying backbite.

I do not like strong syrupy sweet beers, but this seems to mellow out after a few sips. High 11%ABV is hidden nicely. There is a nice balanced carbonation on the finish to this full-bodies Ale. Bitterness is moderate and lingers, but is not overpowering. The finish is dry as would expect given the high ABV and malt content. This brew is quite drinkable despite its strength.

The label is pretty descriptive in the flavor, big body with oak, vanilla, maple. Not as smooth as a couple of bigger malt-bombs I've had, but it is smooth nonetheless for a 11%'er.

A bouquet of fermented fruit demands respect, and I am seduced to raise my snifter slower, and gently reminded to sip a little less. What a grand ale, reigning supreme alongside a handfull of its elder, European brethren. The alcohol is hidden, but the stomach stands to attention, knowing a powerful force has entered.

3.58,-6.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy medium to dark amber color with a solid half inch of off white head with decent sustain. Aroma is signature high gravity DFH: plenty of sweet caramel malt notes and fruity, estery alcohol notes. The Belgian yeast character is quite predominant in the aroma with its dark fruit notes masking what's left (though my cold I'm sure is problematic here). On the palate is where this beer really opens up. The smokey peat is the first thing (and last) that really hits me, it's at my threshold for cloying. The juniper is really not too strong while the vanilla and oak provide the background. This is a complex beer, and what they likely spent a lot of time developing, but I'm not sure it really is to my liking. I'm glad the finish is cloyingly sweet though, it's actually quite nice along with a smooth, low carbonated mouthfeel.

The aroma is not as strong as I've come to expect from such a high ABV brew, but there are oakey, smokey notes and a very subtle sour fruitiness. All of this is heightened as the temperature rises...the alcohol presence does as well. The taste is much richer than the aroma, with a huge smoked peat forefront that melds together with sourdough oakness, and a nice sweet maple finish. This a definitely a full-bodied night capper, but goes down quite smoothely.","beavers","May 14, 2008"

Smelled a little sweet and had a kind of bacon odor to it as well. Strange bacon taste at first but it went away as the beer heated up and then detected the syrupy sweetness and kind of gin taste near the end that must have been the juniper berries and ended in roasty malts.

It's almost a little puckering, and a bit unusual - both in feel and taste. Smoked and toasted malts, almost becomes a little too tart and/or cloying to my palate as it goes - yet, it's not exactly something I'd classify a 'modest sipper,' either.

It leaves some pretty nice lacing on the glass as I drink. The smell is totally dominated by the peat smoked malts and oak aging for me. I get a hint of vanilla and some alcohol in the nose too. The taste is similar to the smell with lots of peat and oak. As it warms it gets sweeter (maybe finally the maple syrup?) and the malts start to shine through but the peat and oak just aren't really doing it for me. Its got a very nice thick mouthfeel that is not unexpected.

The medicinal, syrupy quality comes out more in the smell with many undertones including a rock-candy sugar sweetness. The taste mimics this with a twinge of bitter at the finish. Very syrupy but light in the texture with dark apples and plums seeping through in the taste. In the mouth this begins as a light, thin texture before coming drier and thicker as the beer warms and the palate adapts. Warming throughout the body.

I get the typical notes of rich malts and sweet dark fruits, but I also get the aforementioned formaldehyde smell here, which basically ruins this beer for me. (Please someone beermail me if you have the same experience!) And, accordingly, the formaldehydeness of the beer carries over into the taste. I didn't want to give either category less than a 3, however, simply because I know this has more to do with me than with the beer, which I believe to be well-crafted.

In a pint glass, it appeared deep beer-bottle brown, though it showed a reddish glow when held up to a light. The head was slight and cream-colored, dissipating quickly. Maybe through the influence of the beer's packaging, maple syrup and vanilla came to mind when smelling it, backed with alcohol notes. Up front the taste was woody, again as the bottle and 4-pack carrier promised: oak, oak, oak and then malt flavors remniscent of brown ales and the warming of alcohol upon swallowing like a sip of bourbon. The Immort Ale felt a little thin in the mouth, probably due to the alcohol content, but was quite smooth. I wouldn't put down a bunch of these a night, mostly because of the cost and alcohol content, but one here and there are delicious. I put half of the 4-pack I purchased in the fridge, and am anxious to see how the other two age.","robrobrob","Jul 16, 2007"

The taste was also mainly alcohol even at proper temp and as it warmed. Wasn't overpowering on the alcohol but more of a whiskey than a beer. Not as bad as some but not much there to go back for.

The aroma is sweet vanilla and some earthiness (and a certain medicinal quality that's not really a plus, but I don't realy mind it because this beer has so much going for it). It has a wonderul creamy, rounded mouthfeel that might be the irst thing you'd notice, if not for the incredible array of flavors: the peaty, earthy maltiness is amazing, with rich notes of maple, vanilla, a little caramel-molasses, and yes, I think I even detect the juniper berries.

Appearance is a clear reddish orange hued amber with a thick finger of foamy eggshell white that lingered for a few minutes before settling into a moderate sticky off white ring of lace. Smell is complex, a lot going on in this beer, smoked hickory, sweet toffee and caramelly malts, light vanilla, sweet alcohol, brown sugar, dark ripe fruits, dates and cherries. Taste is big smoked hickory flavors up front, very similar to smokehouse almonds, trails off to sweet malts and earthy undertones, slightly musty and a light alcohol bite pulls the semisweet dry aftertaste to an end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lower carbonation, viscous and smooth, sticks to the lips, coats the mouth. Drinkability is considerably good given the complexity and high 11% abv, wouldn't have more than one to a sitting though. Worth trying, recommend avoiding if the taste and smell of hickory smoke don't strike your fancy.","danielocean03","Oct 02, 2006"

Alcohol taste is more present than I expected, but is still somewhat hidden, alcohol warming starts almost immediately. Alcohol taste goes away soon and gives way to a peaty maple sweetness.

The taste is really big, much like a barlywine. The initial taste is the same smoky flavor thats in the nose, but unlike other big beers there is no taste that lingers for a long time. Peat is also apparent, with an oak-barrel flavor that also sticks out.

Taste was of milk and honey, some tropical fruit characters, and a noticeable medicinal taste. The latter taste does not dominate so much as it seems to get in the way of the other flavors deserving more merit.

The mouth is velvety and unlike most any beer I've ever had. The initial kick of alcohol and caramel is a bit intense, but it mellows out with a smokey vanilla aftertaste.After it sits it starts to have characteristics of a strong, nutty gorgonzola if you can believe it.

The color was classic barleywine chestnut red, and appearance still and headless. The body looked mostly clear, with only a slight haze. The aroma was mostly sweet and malty with a wisp of smoke. The woody smoke that the aroma only hinted at was quite intensely present in the taste. This complimented the sweet and nutty malt, and peppery hops quite nicely. The body was thinner than the typical barleywine with high strength, which I believe to be the result of maple syrup usage.

I really wish I had a proper snifter to swirl this around a bit more but the goblet does for now. Taste is very sweet and a little citrusy. There are some wild fruit flavors (black cherry, raspberries), oakiness, and some a big vanilla taste. Tastes better and better as I drink it an nicely compliments the raspberry cheesecake I'm drinking it with. Finish is very light alcohol and just a touch of roast malt bitterness that lingers for a little while. Definitely covers up the 11% ABV VERY well.

Pours a ruby/brown color with a bit of sediment and a 1/4 inch head that leaves no lacing. The first aromas I noted were fruity (dark fruits, apples?), but they are followed (and overpowered) by oak, caramel, smoke, and vanilla, with bubblegum showing up from time to time. The first sip reveals the flavors noted on the front label - maple, oak, and vanilla - along with caramel, a sugary sweetness and the same fruity notes. It has some faint hops and tobacco hiding in the background and a wonderful mouthfeel that is full, thick, and smooth. This is a big, malty beer with a low level of hops that kinda makes me think of a dopplebock or a Belgian. The oak is nice, though it's a little too pronounced for my liking; however, they get points for originality and not being afraid of experimentation.","mmmbeer","Jun 15, 2005"

Hops are not a huge contributor to this. At least not in the traditional sense. BA classifies this as an American barleywine. I didn't find it to be that, exactly. I don't know what it is, but it's something. If I were to call it an old ale, which is what I probably would do, then i'd call it a damn good one. This beer has many delicate flavors, and the 11% ABV is well disguised. Mouthfeel is superb. I've got a hunch that this will age quite nicely, and perhaps the flavors will become more pronounced.

Unfortunately, the medium-full bodied brew seemed a bit insubstantial. Yes, it was high octane, but seemed closer to hard liquor than beer. While I can understand that madness at 20+% ABV, it didn't seem sensible for a barley wine. The young and sharp hop bite which slightly veiled the omnipresent alcohol tinge was my favorite bit. The brew was quite sugary with hints of maple and wood, but I didn't sense much contribution from the grain bill. The beer also coated my palate in an unpleasant fashion.

The taste is very sweet, probably from the mape syrup. The hop assault peaks early, with little malt to fill in and round out the flavors. A lingering film of stickiness remains on the palate.

Apples, vanilla, somewhat spicy. all kinds of stuff going on here, not much alcohol though considering its 11%. Taste is just as complex as the smell. Thickishly malty sweet with immense fruityness followed by hop spicyness and leaves with alcohol on your tounge. Its mouthfeels is almost idemtical to its taste, I don't think you can describe one without using references to the other - as a good barlywine should be. Not a gulping beer, this is one to be enjoyed on a cold Indiana ( or where ever you are) evening such as this one. Just relax, sip and enjoy.","sabrills70","Nov 13, 2004"

Aroma is deep, malty and very complex with huge fruitiness reminiscent of peaches, apricot and even prunes/plums. An easy 10 on the belgian-like aroma which I would basically almost wear as a perfume. The taste is also very malty with good balancing hops character preventing from being too sweet. Light and comfortable bitterness toward the end. Hints at vanilla and nutmeg, damn this is complex. The body is a little weak I found though for a beer of this magnitude it was rather thin although comfortable and very clean. Rich and full-flavoured, thanks a lot to Egajdzis!

Aroma is malty and slightly fruity, and the alcohol is obvious. Taste is malty, but tends towards a woody taste, and again, the alcohol character is dominant. Mouthfeel is a bit lower due to the harshness of alcohol, even if you should expect it at 11%abv.

The aroma was of sweet vanilla balanced with malt and a touch of alcohol. The flavor of this Barleywine is more along the lines of an american take on an english barleywine without getting too far from the hops. Not too sweet but not too bitter either this ale begins with an initial hop bitterness that is immedietly overshadowed by the smooth rich malt sweetness that sticks around to let you know you are drinking a barleywine. Damn smooth i almost want to say that this is the smoothest beer i have tasted with this much alcohol but my memory is a little hazy on the subject of high alcohol ales. I would love to always have a case of this in my cellar but the price and availability in my area makes this nearly impossible. Drink this beer if you have a chance.","RenoZymurgist","Jul 30, 2004"

Flavor is unpleasantly bitter when cold, but as it warms many other flavors come into play and tone it down. Powdery, chalky sensation and a chocolate flavor lead with a fruity middle and a vanilla touch to the *relatively* dry finish. As I sip this beer I find myself raising numbers in my rating.

A very balanced beer with no trace of the alcohol in the taste. Its body and mouthfeel are a bit on the thin side, which helps the drinkability.

Quite a bit of carbonation in a style of beer that I would have figured to be on the lower end of CO2. Floral hops, maple and malt are the first things that I smell as I take my first drink.

Immense aromas hit the nose. Plums and lilacs begin the assault, followed by maple and vanilla syrup and a touch of smokiness. Alcohol is also picked up. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Tart and "melt in your mouth" kind of creamy chewy, but there is a slight alcohol bite. Taste is maple syrupy with a big hops presence. Hard hitting alcohol, but I didn't note the oak mentioned on the label. This is a very complex ale, as most DFHs are, but the complexities don't mask the big abv as well as their 120 Minute IPA, IMHO. Finishes bitter and syrupy.

The six months have not helped to mellow this beer significantly, I still find it unbalanced. Overwhelming floral, spicey, maple, vanilla presence in the nose and taste. I think Dogfishhead sometimes tries to pack too much into a beer, though they should be credited for challenging the norm. I would not want to drink more than one of these beers at a time.

The aroma also seems to be much sweeter, while the flavor is dry and very sweet, varying between a candy like, maple taste; fruity flavors like apple, pear and grape; and a malty finish high in alcohol.

I'm wondering if perhaps I got an off bottle -- some big diacetyl flavors. A light coconut and woody extract flavor finishes it off.

The alcohol kick is still there in a major way....did they add vodka to this brew? The alcohol seems separate from the beer here. Other brews at higher ABV are much more drinkable (even other dogfish head brews, olde school comes to mind), and I really can't taste much past the vodka bite and sweet maltiness.

This beer acts like a paint brush, and my palate as the easel. A true well done piece of art like poetry with the sharp mildly bitter sweetness coming down with each stroke on my tongue. Leaves notes of vanilla and maple syrup here a very full and challenging flavor, but no way is this overbearing. The art form that exists here is that because a brewerer managed to complement so many flavors together in one beer. Great beer, I plan on picking up more of these to age, and hopefull I will be able to bring out more of these subtle flavors and tame the sharpness of the sweet tones to make room for other experiences with in this bottle. The mouthfeel is a chewy full mouthfeel mindblowing experience to sip and enjoy.

The 11% alchohol is masked very well in the flavor and isn't as overpowering as I'd have thought it would be.  Nice warming effect as it goes down.","Winter","Nov 07, 2002"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Beatiful mahogany-brown colour, very sweet malty nose, with lots of syrup, raisins, vanilla, caramel, and perhaps some oak. A sipper, strong, warming, with a complex, and long finish, lots of maple, oak, a touch of vanilla and a peppery warming finish, some bitterness and acid, but its more sweet than anything, very tasty stuff indeed, one of the better barley wines i've had, its not one dimensionally sticky, like others.","rastaman","Nov 05, 2002"
3.8,-0.5,4,4,4,4,3,"The off white dense head covers a deep ruby brew w/ a slight haze. The aroma is an odd melange of woody notes, an earthy and herbal hop nose along with black licorice sweetness. Esters are there as well, and consist of both fruity prune like notes and subtle bubblegum. Chocolately, dryish powered notes cocoa hit the palate at first, then is immediately followed by rich molasses sweetness and toasty malt. Surprisingly, a slightly conflicting light clove phenol surfaces mid palate, but is offset by penetrating, dark caramel malt. Hop bitterness is low, and allows malt sweetness to almost completely dominate. Moderate in body, w/ a dextrinous, sugary mouthfeel. Finishes w/ brown sugar like sweetness lingering. Immort Ale is an eccentric brew... Cellaring may help the flavors meld, but since hop bitterness is already low, it might get even sweeter. Odd, but very enjoyable.","marc77","Sep 15, 2002"
2.83,-25.9,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I am a big Dogfish fan but this brew was just too strong. Maybe if it aged a few years it would be perfect. The insant taste is that of maple, raisins, and strong alcohol. It tends to take the flavor away from what could be a great beer. Very hard to dring a full bottle. A deep dark color.","Jdiddy","Sep 01, 2002"
4.19,9.7,4,5,4,4.5,3.5,"Clear darker brown umber color, decent dark yellow head that settles at 1/4 inch for a minute or so.  Lots of aromas, raisins, plums, maple sugar candy.  Flavor is deep with appropriate "cough syrup" body -- smokey vanilla, rum soaked fruitcake.  Snap of hop bitter at the end that's enhanced by the alcoholic impressions.  A big beer who's taste was less complex than the smell or my expectations implied...but I did enjoy it quite a bit.","ADR","Aug 29, 2002"
3.93,2.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"I'm not that fond of Dogfish Head beers, but this beer is a very unique and complex Barleywine. Not the best, but certainly worth tracking down for a try.","Todd","Aug 17, 2002"
4.27,11.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Copyright on the bottle says 1999...I'm not sure if it was bottled then but I wouldn't doubt it as this is exceptionally smooth for the alcohol load...sweet fruit( and bourban on the nose, along with a heavy dose of alcohol...definitely a sweet bourban/maple/sweet fruit flavor....the hops are there and balance but don't bite you....very complex...a very small hint of vanilla as the bottle states...don't know if I would have caught it if I wasn't looking for it...a big warming effect in the tummy...I think this is spectacular....an exciting, challenging BW that is a true treat to put to the lips..I am rating the drinkability high for its style...obviously this isn't a beer you'd want to kick back a six pack of....a true sipping beer...","ZAP","Jul 09, 2002"
4.37,14.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Damn. Wow. I am a man now. Complex is a good word to describe this beer. Pours out to an innocent looking amber, with a slight head. Then, it kicks all your senses. There are so many tastes in this beer, I don't know where to start. Fruit, pine, and an alcohol finish that is hidden well. Not for the weak hearted, I'll tell ya that. As this beer warmed, the flavors mellowed, but became more satifsfying.","proc","Jul 09, 2002"
3.8,-0.5,4,4,4,3,3.5,"This is a very complex libation.  Presents with a deep orange color and no lasting head.  The aromas floating of of this ale are consuming.  Hints of old oak and fermented maple syrup are rare and inviting.  The flavor is also quite complex with a strong oak character and a lingering vanilla touch.  Quite a warming alcohol content.  One of the best in the style currently available.","beernut7","Jun 04, 2002"
4.62,20.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"The beer pours mohagony in color with very little head.  I note some heavy wood accents on the nose as well as vanilla and pine.  The first thing that really hits me on the buds is alcohol, but it really isn't overbearing or obnoxious.  Then I get a dry woody taste.  Cedar-like.  Then there's also coffee and vanilla bean qualities.  Very complex to say the least.   Excellent taste qualities.  Mouthfeel is a little like cough syrup, but given the taste of this "cough syrup", it's easy to look past it.  Very drinkable for 11% a/v.  Excellent brew.","Bighuge","May 29, 2002"

Even if not for that connection, however, this is still quite a special brew. Dark burgundy, with a slight white head. Complex malty sweetness, like ripe dark fruits. Somewhat bready up front. Alcohol is there, but not overwhelming. Dry, fruity finish. I like this beer!","mophie","Apr 26, 2002"

4,4.7,4,4,4.5,4,3,"Notes: A barley wine of no other, so extreme and complex this could easily use another year or two to mellow out. Though it is fine to sip in the brash form that it is in now. Outstanding.","Jason","Apr 05, 2002"
4.42,15.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a very dark amber, almost brown.  Decent head of the pour but it didn't stay all that well, faded down to a thin lace.  Smells of vanilla, smokiness, alcohol, and a very light maple.  The first sensations to hit my tongue are sweetness and hop bitterness at the same time.  A light smoke character throughout the taste, traces of vanilla, and alcohol.  For the strength of this brew you don't really taste the alcohol all that strongly.  Very drinkable for its potency.  I can't wait to get some more of this brew and lay it down.","Murph","Mar 01, 2002"

3.6,-5.8,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Peat smoke, sweetness & alcohol, a bit overwhelming, I think they blend well into a good mix of different & complex tastes. 11% sipping brew. I thought this was a pretty good barley wine-style ale. Overall pretty good.","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 18, 2002"
4.7,23,4,4,5,5,5,"This is up there with the great barleywines.  Sweet and tangy, yet not overpowering.  A lot like Victory's Old Horizontal.  Mediocre barleywines are out there everywhere, and Immort Ale is way above that category.","mmthompson33","Dec 11, 2001"
4.84,26.7,4,5,5,4,5,"Whoa! Holy....poop, what a helluva beer! Like nothing I've ever had before. Can't compare it to anything in recent memory, it's a one of a kind distinctive beer...you must try before you die! A treasure of the brewers art. As an aside, check this out: after discovering this new arrival at the local liquor store a few years back, I bought the six-pack up to the counter, where the clerk couldn't find a price on it, (and honestly I had no idea how much it was, later to find it was 13 bucks) asked where I found it, I replied "in the warm beer aisle", and he said "Ok...$4.99" That made the beer taste all the much more grand!","beerluvr","Dec 02, 2001"
