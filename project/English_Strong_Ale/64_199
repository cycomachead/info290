4.79,25.4,5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"rich and viscous, beautifully aged (2009 bottle drank in 2014), this beer stands out at its peak as a beautifully unique deity of beers. the maple and vanilla are so heavy and rich yet so smooth and not overpowering. The smoke is beautifully present yet subtle. The beer is a work of art at this point in its age. It's a 5 at this point.","Severdali","Dec 14, 2014"
