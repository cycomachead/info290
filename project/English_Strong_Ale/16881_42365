3.39,2.7,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"I think others have covered the tasting notes here. Not really light but more light than heavy. Not really getting much whiskey here. Liken it to a subtle innis & gunn original. Find that citrus aftertaste (orange) becomes a little, not very overpowering towards the end of the bottle. Definitely worth another go around and now I definitely have to try the blonde. For $7.... I would probably not drink it for a very long time but I would buy it over innis & gunn (my only reference point) 10 times out of ten.","randallthirteen","Jul 11, 2013"

3.32,0.6,3.25,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, it is not at all powerful and very drinkable for a 7% ABV ale. I don't feel the whisky vibe going on, as much as the caramel and orange flavor with the malty sweetness.","martinlauridsen","Jul 24, 2012"

3.5,6.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"330 ml. bottle. Amber colour, moderate head that fades quickly. Smell of malts, some vanilla, hints of whisky, apricots and caramel. Rather thin body, kind of sweet in the palate. Taste is just the same as smell, some whisky (not really very strong), apricots and vanilla. I expected more of this one.","janubio","Feb 06, 2011"
