3.35,-1.8,4.25,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Malty aroma has a strong overtone of ginger. I like ginger. Pours a dark, slightly hazy mahogany with a thick, fluffy wheat head. Ginger overpowers all the other flavors - malt and a hint of woody hops. I like ginger, but this tastes more like ginger ale than the real stuff. Smooth texture has good body and is quite fizzy. Tasty, but maybe next time lighten up on the ginger, sâ€™il vous plait.","Cyberkedi","Jul 28, 2014"

3.97,16.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.25,"I love ginger beer, and I love beer. Here we have ginger beer with real beer! Love it! It's a fairly sweet brew, with a dominant ginger smell and flavor. There's a bit of malt, and perhaps some hops, but this beer is about ginger. Mouthfeel is definitely a cross between beer and soda. I am really enjoying this! Of course, you better like ginger if you grab one of these. But if you do, it's a sweet gingery treat. I can't really compare it to normal beers and ales. Be careful! It goes down fast.","Beerdanza","Nov 21, 2013"
