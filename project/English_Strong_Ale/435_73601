Hell, the bottle is worth a buck to me to homebrew so how the hell can the beer not be worth 89 cents. Had to try a few of the Minhas beers. Pretty good looking beer, but not sure what I am smelling. But I have had beers with no nose that were tasty. Well, not so much, not the worst beer I have ever had but certainly not what I would call good. The funny thing is that I am trying to figure out if I would buy more for the bottles and the alcohol, I mean, $1.89. Nah, rather save a little liver mileage for something else. That said, gonna use the bottle so nothing lost.","JamieDuncan","Feb 16, 2014"
