3.76,-1.3,3.5,4.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"O - This is pretty straight-forward, uncomplicated ale designed to feature the bourbon barrel aging characteristics. The sugars are forward, but not so much that's it's overly sweet, like Kentucky Bourbon Ale. It's quite drinkable without being distinctive, and pairs well with something like a full-bodied, somewhat spicy cigar, which I enjoyed immensely with this growler. The best aspect of this beer is the nose - it's to be savored before drinking. Recommended as a nitecap.","BuckeyeSlim","Jul 06, 2013"
