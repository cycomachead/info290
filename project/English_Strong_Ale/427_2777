2.88,-12.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"A fairly average strong ale. Very yeasty and slightly sweet, but lacking in malt flavours and aroma. I guess I'd expect the style to have a darker and more distinct malt character. No aromatic hops, and the bitterness is dry and harsh. There are certainly better beers out there - give it a miss.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 06, 2009"
3.21,-2.4,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"M: The ending is the best part because it last really long it is very bitter at the end and can be felt in the back part of the mouth.","karait95","Jul 22, 2009"
3.83,16.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"D - I'm not sure this beer is categorized correctly. To me it's a very good quality EPA, Whatever it is this beer is a very solid brew.","eric5bellies","Jun 28, 2009"
3.36,2.1,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Dr: It hides its alcohol well, and if I were a fan of the style, I'd have another. It's not horribly ambitious, but what it tries to do it does well.","kojevergas","Mar 26, 2009"
3.28,-0.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"500 ml bottle pours nicely into my 300 ml "pint" glass. Minimal head leads to some lacing in glass. Nice dark golden colour. Smell is not overly assaulting to the senses. I was hoping for more piney citrusy sensation. Taste is average, once again, not as hoppy as anticipated, just a mild sensation of hops, very mild malts and some alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Drinkability is fine-certainly more desirable to an American macrobeer from the big three. I would try again but there are other strong pale ales that would end up in my cart first.","jhtipton","Jan 07, 2009"
3.94,19.8,3,4,4,3,4.5,"D- If this was available on tap, I'd be ordering this often. I can see myself drinking this as a nice session beer. The alcohol is well hidden, it's refreshing, flavorful and is easy to drink. Would go excellent with pub food. I recommend trying this one out.","ChrisCage","Jul 07, 2008"
3.85,17,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I liked it better than "Pedigree" and will probably buy it again.","MAB","Feb 15, 2008"
3.31,0.6,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Quite smooth for a fairly well carbonated beer, the hops only become apparent in the aftertaste and then only with significant concentration. Otherwise there is a pleasant but unremarkable caramel tinged malt domination.","charlatan","Dec 02, 2007"
2.16,-34.3,4,3,1.5,2,2,"D - I didn't have to pour it down the sink, but I'm not heading back to the store for another one, either.","stagger","Mar 17, 2007"
3.4,3.3,2,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Overall, it's a lot more drinkeable than you might expect for a 6.2ABV beer. Clean and tasty.","prosper",
