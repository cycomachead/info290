4.46,15.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall: this is by far one of my favourite English beers - it ticks all the right boxes. Nicely complex, great feel, great package, great aroma, easy drinking and can be a slow-sipper if you want. A decent price too for a top-end Brit, at AU$8. definitely worth the having.","SmashPants","Nov 16, 2014"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"An excellent beer with tonnes going on and a beer that strikes a great balance between the rich malty flavours and the sweet, dark fruit like ones.

3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Nice - a quaffable strong ale. Subtle and sweet; a good sipping ale that suits winter more than summer. The reduced score for appearance was due to the excess of floating yeast. I like this one, and commend it to all who encounter it.","jazzyjeff13","Jun 04, 2011"
3.48,-9.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours mahogany with a bubbly cream coloured head. Translucent body, with moderate head retention and good lacing. Nose is bready, alcohol, sweet and mildly acidic grape skins, a very fine and extremely mild acetic note and caramel overriding most of this. Notable English character in the mild hopping and malt. Taste is interesting, again an English caramel and bready quality, with some slightly sharp alcoholic notes. A fine hint of balsamic vinegar, some pear and a general fruitiness - berries and some other dark fruits. Touch of spice. Mouthfeel is moderate with a medium high carbonation, alcoholic for the most part however. Interesting, yet quite confusing as to what I should be rating this as - foreign to almost anything I've tried. Pleasant to try, doubtful that I'd revisit.","liamt07","Mar 12, 2011"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Bought 2 bottles, reviewed the first march 2011. Half litre bottle. Dark ruby mahogany colour. Clear. The head goes fairly quickly. The malts dominate the smell but some sour pear comes out as well. The 7.2 percent comes through strongly, its too much, it dominates. I got a bit of smoke with some apple. This isn't a smooth beer. Not easy to drink. Have to say I expected a bit more. Second bottle reviewed one year later. Aging the beer really worked, it had a nice fruity aroma, a much smoother texture and the alcohol was so well hidden. This is definately a beer to age before drinking.","jonb5","Feb 11, 2011"
3.78,-2.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Nose is exceptionally floral and fruity, loads of green apples and flowers. Hints of honey and caramel malt. Flavor is clean and approachable, while not altogether noteworthy. Middling sweet, pleasant hints of bread and honey, light cocoa, caramel; quite a bit of bittering hops in the finish which provides a really grassy, dry finish. Extremely light body for the ABV which is hidden - nowhere to be found except in your head as the bottle progresses.... Drinkable and pleasant, could use a little more complexity but for what it is, it's a pleasant beer.","ritzkiss","Feb 08, 2011"

Smells malty with caramel, toffee, slight lemon zest with hops revealing themselves toward the end. Tastes malty with caramel, sweet candy like notes, noticeable alcohol with a medium bitterness and a sweet aftertaste. Medium to thin mouthfeel that was watery at times, good light carbonation though. This is above average but thats it, I feel like this would be good on tap as opposed to bottle, I would have it again but not for some time though.","peensteen","Jan 24, 2011"

3.99,3.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is gently carbonated and not overly creamy or thick. It glides easily over your palate and has just enough carbonation to tickle you the whole way. Overall it is a nice round medium body with a smoothly rich palate. The finish is sweet with a short hint of bitter hops. This would be a nice accompaniment to roast game dishes or rich cheeses, but really I think it was built to stand on its own.","StephenRich","Jun 26, 2010"
4.17,8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"500ml bottle from the LCBO, poured into a goblet. Deep reddish brown with a thin ring of cream white head. Smell and taste are cherry, bubblegum, toffee, rich malts, barley, red plums, dark fruit sweetness, fig, Christmas cake, butterscotch, citrus hop bitterness, quite spicy and astringent, warming alcohol to end. Fuller than medium palate coats the mouth with foamy, citric, and drying textures. An unusually hoppy English strong which isn't surprising given the generous use of Cascade hops. Perhaps not as complex as the style can be, but still an outstanding sipper. This will now be a regular purchase for me.","cratez","Jun 14, 2010"
4.35,12.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"I can't see asking anything more from an English Strong Ale. Many British brewers operate on illusions of grandeur but few actually create the succulent, refined ales they boast to. Brakspear Triple, along with Fullers Vintage Ale, 1845 and Greene King Strong Suffolk, are the beers that truly define what it means to drink to the fullest extent.","biegaman","Jun 04, 2010"
3.68,-4.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not a bad little strong ale, very drinkable. The alcohol isn't masked perfectly, but the corresponding flavors certainly get the job done. A bit strong for a session, but it works as a good finish to a long day.","JohnnyBarman","May 27, 2010"
4.23,9.6,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Pours a dark amber, almost brown colour with thick off-white head. Tons of lacing. Has a sweet, roasted fruit smell. Taste has a lot of banana and raisin with some sort of spices. Little bit of hop presence too. Very smooth carbonation level. This is dangerously drinkable for a moderately strong beer. I'm glad I randomly picked this up.","kwjd","Apr 06, 2010"

3.45,-10.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Definitively not a typical (Belgium-style-like) tripel. More a boozy ale. Not bad to try once, but a too flat and too boring.","rvdoorn","Jun 04, 2009"

3.29,-14.8,3,4,3,3.5,3,"Coffee brown, mahogany along the edges with a yellowed ivory head. Not very good retention for a bottle-conditioned ale. Nose is mostly cola with a good smack of citrus, especially lime and grapefruit, intersected by grape and pear-like fruitiness and unusual notes of dark honey, varnish, and fresh pineapple. Tastes rather sweet and surprisingly bland; bready and yeasty with some quiet fruity and spicy notes. A surge of whiskey-like alcohol fires up the finish, which, along with a consistently hoppy bitter orange flavor and a light, airy, dry body, helps to add balance. Not bad, but not very interesting - way too bland to warrant the strength.","soulgrowl","Nov 27, 2008"
4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Even though this is relatively high alcohol beer, it is not overbearing in any way from the alcohol, the hops, or the malt.

4.01,3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Old leather armchairs, Gentlemens clubs and money, that is what this beer reminds me of. I can imagine warm lounges, smoking jackets and cigars when drinking this.

4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"3 M&3 D: even smoother than the last bottle, yet the texture turns a bit thin at the tail of each sip, while the body is not yet three-dimensional.

3.49,-9.6,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Mouthfeel is a bit on the syrupy side for my taste. Palate is hot, stinging, generally fruity and sweet. Finish is even hotter with some yeasty bitterness and lots of alcohol. Not bad but rather 'malt liquorish'.","Antilochus","Feb 12, 2008"
3.53,-8.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500mL bottle from LCBO. Consumed Feb 08 with a best before date in April 08. Pours a dark gold with just a couple of floaties from swishing the bottom of the bottle. Solid malty aroma. Solid malty flavour as well, but with a slight bit of tangy fruitiness as well. However, the aftertaste is all malt, which isn't quite my thing. RE-RATE in April 08. Man, it's going down nicely. Still malty, but seemingly richer and satisfying an itch as it goes down the throat. Upped the ratings a bit.","sstackho","Jan 10, 2008"

Really fresh aroma...apples, oranges and pine needles. The taste has a nice apple edge to the malt body, but I can also detect the presence of darker fruits, as well as caramel and nut. The finish is refreshingly bitter, with a slight warmth from well-hidden alcohol. Excellent beer, that seems to gain complexity with each sip!","bobsy","Jan 04, 2008"

Taste is neat, spiciness up front, very bready, sweet honey and caramel malts, lots of grass and floral, some minerals, strawberries, yeast and honey in the finish, some dry spices as well, just a touch of alcohol but its nicely hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth, nice dry finish, little bit of warmth.
