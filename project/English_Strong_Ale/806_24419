4.46,15.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall: this is by far one of my favourite English beers - it ticks all the right boxes. Nicely complex, great feel, great package, great aroma, easy drinking and can be a slow-sipper if you want. A decent price too for a top-end Brit, at AU$8. definitely worth the having.","SmashPants","Oct 12, 2014"

3.67,-4.9,,,,,,"Copper colour with no head. Theree seems to be dried fruit, apple, lemon and sherbet in the nose. This is certainly on the citric side for an English Strong Ale, but there is a pleasant variety of discernible flavours aside from lemon, including vanilla, oak, brown sugar and a little mint. Good stuff.","charlatan","Jun 26, 2013"

4.07,5.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark copper hue with a off white two finger head and very nice clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is fruitcake,strawberry jam,boozy alcohol,brandied raisins and herbal hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,moderately carbonated but still rounds the palette with tastes of chocolate coated cherries,booze,roasted nuts,herbal hops and finished with a caramel candy bittersweetness and overall i like it and the perfect after dinner drop and would buy again as would age well cheers.","ADZA","Aug 25, 2012"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"An excellent beer with tonnes going on and a beer that strikes a great balance between the rich malty flavours and the sweet, dark fruit like ones. The caramel that both the aroma and taste start with are a lot stronger than I would have expected but this is a beer that I will be seeking out again in the near future.","flyingpig",
