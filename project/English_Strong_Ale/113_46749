I know its not fair to judge on one bad bottle - it happens.  I will revisit and update my review at some time.","Givemebeer","Mar 24, 2015"

3.99,-2.4,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of nice caramelized malt notes with subtle toffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by caramelized malt notes with light toffee notes with a hint of residual sugar notes. Malt notes are really well balanced and showed clear cereal notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Good example of a style that should be brewed more often.","Phyl21ca","Jan 30, 2015"
