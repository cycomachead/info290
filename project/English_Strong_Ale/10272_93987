3.55,-7.6,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: A pretty good brew, though like many I&G beers not quite perfect. So-so looks; shame the head disappears too rapidly. The aroma and flavour are a pleasant mix of caramel malt, dried fruit, yeast esters and mild woodiness. The cherrywood adds something but the effect is subtle. Body is OK. The biggest problem is that the character seems too clean and polished - I reckon bottle conditioning would add a layer of complexity that would give it a boost. However, it goes down easily enough on a winter's evening. Worth trying if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Oct 11, 2014"
4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.25,"M- Thick bodied and slightly syrupy, yet with plenty of carbonation to keep my palate relatively cleansed!  The flavors are robust and full, and never let you truly forget what you are tasting....I feel like this could be part of a compote for pancakes or something breakfasty.  I like it, but not quite to the same extent as other I&G fare.....still, a very good beer that is innovative, using the Canadian Cherrywood and it doesn't disappoint!","ChrisCage","Oct 10, 2014"

4.75,23.7,,,,,,"Overall: I quite enjoyed this beer. I am a Scottish Canadian so I felt it represented both very well. The cherrywood adds a nice twist to the regular oak aged Innis & Gunn. It's a kind of beer where you would like 2 or 3 at the pub watching the game.","marcusR111","Jul 20, 2014"

3.46,-9.9,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served from the bottle at the Toronto Festival of Beer, this like several I&G offerings hit me as immediately really overwhelmingly sweet, with a woody vanilla tone, a lot of candied woody character, you definitely pick up a lot of the cherry wood aspects, which is interesting but also frustratingly overpowering, I found it too sweet and woody in comparison to some of the other things they have done.","mick303","Jul 08, 2014"
3.74,-2.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall - One of the better and more enjoyable ones from I&G, but still doesn't blow me away like the original did when I first had it, but with some slightly different nuances and a well hidden ABV, you could do far worse than this. At its price point, a definite try for I&G fans","DenisKolkin",
