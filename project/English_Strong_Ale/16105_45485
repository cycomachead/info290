3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, rich, ruby-copper coloring with only the slightest filmy covering of a head. Aromas are earthy and richly sweet, with brown sugar and vanilla characteristics on a toffee backbone. Smells rich. The beer's flavors are strong and rich, and they are conveyed on a full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Roasted and toasted, the flavors of caramel, butter, nut, and vanilla shine through, all very well blended and balanced, with a grainy flavor lacing throughout. Interesting, and surprisingly drinkable with all the strong qualities. There is a hops presence that reveals more into the aftertaste, with the roasted qualities combining to leave a slight drying effect, giving the beer a short-lived, somewhat clean finish. Very tasty brew, and would likely go well with just about any kind of rich, meaty foods...like, say, turkey.","GarthDanielson","Nov 26, 2011"

Taste is sweet and fruity like the nose suggested. I'm picking up an astringency that is a bit unpleasant. I can't figure out if it's from the wood that I otherwise can't find or something else. There seems to be a hint of Belgian yeast in here as well. Medium body, moderate level of carbonation with a sweet fruity syrupy mouthfeel.

The Belgian yeast character is quite up-front in the aroma, bready and spicy, slight banana and clove, but the caramel sweetness really cuts through and provides some balance. Light herbal and grassy notes, perhaps some nutmeg. Same in the flavour, but with some raisin/dried fruits and sturdy bitterness providing a base for the malt and yeast.

The taste is much like the smell, toasted malts, dried fruit, kind of a scotch finish and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is nice. Smooth, nice carbonation and a little bit dry in the finish. Overall this is nice, I'll enjoy it with my turkey and it drinks pretty well.","Bendurgin","Nov 16, 2010"

The malts that were present in the nose really are exhibited nicely in the taste with a rich roasted caramel to almost cocoa nature in play with this ale. The vanilla that was present faintly in the nose really comes through nicely in the taste as it streaks its way across the roasted complexities and brings out a bit more of the hops and oak barrel uniqueness that launches this ale into a category of Thanksgiving greatness.","Bounty628","Dec 11, 2009"

Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is creamy smooth tangy and full bodied complimenting the taste nicely.

Poured a translucent mahogany with a bubbly, off-white, quarter inch head the quickly disperses into a soapy skim and a cluster of bubbles around the perimeter of the bowl. No lacing on this one. Mild nose - definitely getting a little oak and some sweet malty goodness. Taste follows nose - also a little creamy and toasty, with a touch of bittering hops coming out at the finish and a lightly lingering, somewhat medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light and lively with a slightly dry finish. Tasty with a well-hidden, but flavor profile seems a little nondescript an American Strong.","Jwale73","Beers"

3.85,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This has the makings of a red ale, on high test. The beer is low carbonation, clear, mahogany, no lacing or retention. The beer is quite syrupy too. The nose has the slight chicory aroma of a red, coupled with phenols, some ABV whiffs, with some liquor soaked florals. There are some roasted, almost charred notes in the taste, lots of crystal malts, some English ale yeastiness. There are also some caramel in the taste too. As the beer settles a bit, there are definite boozy fruit flavors coming through. This is a nice beer, tasty, a bit strong, a little bit of ABV makes its way into the finish, but overall quite respectable. There is a touch of hop in the finish just to keep things a bit more balanced. If you're in the mood for a relatively flat, slightly syrupy, crystal malty ale, this is a good stop.","albern","Nov 15, 2009"

3.51,-9.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer pours brown with a cherry oak colored highlights when held up to the light. Pretty clear in color has a cream colored head that was about an inch and a half thick that goes away fairly quickly. When it's gone it produces a ring around the edges with minimal lacing. The smell isn't what I expected. It actually smells bready/yeasty, Belgian actually, and almost a banana aroma. Malts are present, caramelized. Has a very slight citrus hop that you really have to search for. The taste is better, but still nothing like an American Strong Ale. There's still a lot going on in the flavor department however. Heavy on the malts, maybe some type of bourbon or scotch flavor to it. Very yeasty again and it almost seems to have some type of peanut oil aftertaste. There are some hops present in the flavor as well, has a bitter smokey aftertaste that goes along with the previously mentioned peanut oil taste. With all that's going on. Mouthfeel is pretty good, a little dryer than I expected, but good, it's pretty drinkable as well. I'm generally a pretty big fan of American Strong Ale's, but this was nothing like I've ever tasted before. I'd like to try it on tap and maybe get another bottle, because Im almost not convinced this is what it was supposed to taste like. If I don't like it the second time it won't keep me away from the brewery though, that's for sure.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 11, 2009"

3.78,-2.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"It is great to see Mayflower release their first big beer in bombers. I was lucky enough to try this last year on tap, and now it has arrived in the bottle. I poured it in to a Duvel glass. Color is a dark rosewood color, with a big pillow like white head. Despite the color, it still maintains a lot of clarity when held up to the light next to me. The first thing that strikes me is the strong wood notes in the nose, I can tell right off the bat that this had oak involved in it. There are also some smells of peanut butter, vanilla, toffee, and a hint of whiskey. Man, that peanut butter flavor really shows up in the smell along with the oak. Chocolate and molasses are other flavors that come to mind when sipping. It comes off as moderately sized, with the malt dominating...I might like a little more weight. Drinkability is fine, but with the large flavors and complexity, it definitely is a brew to take your time with, and let open up. This is every bit as good as I remember it being last year, perhaps a notch or two better. My favorite thing about this beer is that it speaks to the history of New England. Great stuff here from Mayflower, and I cannot wait to see how that barrel aged Barleywine turns out. Pair this one with Thanksgiving dinner. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 03, 2008"

I get oak, whiskey and some vanilla. Taste is similar - lots of booze in the flavor. First off I get a lot of vanilla, then the whiskey. Someone commented "I think someone put a shot in my beer!" Very full flavor-wise. Very thin mouthfeel. I don't know if it is from the lack of carbonation, though. I cant believe this beer is only 7.7%- it's strength in flavor makes it seem much more. Pretty drinkable, though. I had 2, and will definitely have again!","DrDogbeer","0"
