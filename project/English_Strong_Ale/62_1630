Half finger of white head and more than average lacing long after. The nose is of heavy malt, bread, syrup, and strawberry or raspberry I can't quite tell. The taste is nothing of memorable quality, strong alcohol taste (almost rubbing alcohol), malt, and burnt syrup. The mouthfeel is thin and definitely minimal carbonation. Overall nothing great and nothing I would get again","anthony23cippy","Jan 24, 2015"
