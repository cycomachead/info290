4.12,13.2,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall: this is definitely the best of Coopers' beers, with their Best Extra Stout taking a close second. A complex and easy-drinking beer for either a session, or chilling with for a half-hour. They cellar for a number of years too, and can improve with age. Well worth the AU$83 for a case of 24 x 375mL.","SmashPants","Dec 01, 2014"
