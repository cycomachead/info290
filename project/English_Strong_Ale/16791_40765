3.71,6.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, alcohol. Taste is malty, caramel, slightly sweet, a hint of alcohol, some molasses.. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer.","tone77","Mar 18, 2013"

3.78,8.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Here is a very European red ale. It's a very clear amber color, with an off-white head. The aroma is all malt...with a touch of yeast and alcohol. Slight toast, biscuit...very sweet...almost a honey-like scent. The taste is similar. Lots of malt, balance to the sweet side with serious malt flavor. Not really roasted, but rather toasted and bread-crust. Firm mouthfeel. Again, very European in it's feel.","Suds","Jan 15, 2012"

3.07,-11.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Too one dimensional for me, and even though I can appreaciate diacetyl, the intensity became overwhelming. It was a fun ride the first 8 ounces, but then I was ready to move on.","DoubleJ","Jun 21, 2011"
3.52,1.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a 1.5" off-white head which disappeared pretty quickly. Looks like a clear glass of tea with just the faintest hint of red, so I'm not sure what makes this a red ale. Smell has malt and caramel. Taste is some of the same but milder and with a little sweetness. The mouthfeel is one of the finer attributes of this because it feels kind of like a lighter-weight tripel. Good beer just not a great beer. Still, it's fun to try something from Argentina.","MoreThanWine","Jun 12, 2011"
4.32,24.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: Although beers like this used to be commonplace, they're now becoming fairly rare. Outside of Briton I'm not sure you'll find anything quite like this. And this is from Argentina? How weird? But OK, I love it!!! It's loaded with flavor and character, and despite the slightly elevated alcohol you could easily have more than one. Well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Jun 06, 2011"

3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: A solid brew overall, but it is bordering on cloying. Nonetheless, the caramel and honey are delicious, and the brew is definitely pleasant.","Avagadro","Apr 02, 2011"
3.18,-8.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"D- Not a terrible beer, but there isn't anything particularly exciting about it, and it's just simply a slightly above average beer for me. Would drink again, but I wouldn't buy it again at its current price.","jsprain1","Mar 08, 2011"
3.49,0.6,3.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,"D: Very drinkable for a such a large beer and the style. A surprise I would consider again.","kjyost","Dec 30, 2010"
2.7,-22.2,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nasty cloudy color kinda rust colored. I guess you could say. The beer tasted more like like some kind of juice. It was very sweet also. I poured it down the drain after several hits. I will not buy again.","Minkybut","Dec 02, 2010"
2.8,-19.3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Pours a cloudy, dark maize color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of grain, cider-like aroma, slight metallic, hint of honey, and a hint of wheat. Barely fits the style of a English Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, cider-like flavor, hint of honey, and slight sweet malt. Overall, poor appearance, and lacking in aroma and body.","Tone","Nov 15, 2010"
3.48,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Aroma is rich, malty and yeasty with just a hint of caramel. It pours a clear dark coppery amber, almost mahogany, with a minimal head. Flavor is malty and fruity with caramel and spicy hints, and just a little honey-like sweetness. Texture is smooth and just a little tingly. OK, give the folks in Argentina a decent chance, and they will produce a truly great beer!","Cyberkedi","Oct 23, 2010"
3.93,13.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours from the 16.9 oz bottle (which appears to have some floaties inside. yeast? I don't see anything on the label indicating bottle-conditioning) a hazy, apple juice colored copper with a 1 1/2 finger head that disappears almost instantly. Makes quite a lot of fizzing noise on the pour, but once it settles there are a quite a few bubbles rising in the glass. Aroma is a nice mix of malt, caramel, and apples. 1st sip is a dry apple cider-ish note followed by some apple and caramel sweetness in the middle and on the swallow...with maybe a touch of honey thrown in. Mouthfeel is light, but not watery, with a slight sparkle on the tongue from the carbonation. Drinkability is quite high...I could easily see myself going through these one after another on a football Sunday. The alcohol is so well hidden, it appears to be almost non-existent. Overall, this is a very nice brew! I've never seen or heard of this before, but i'll make sure to pick up more of this on future beer runs!","CJfromPhilly","Oct 12, 2010"
4.1,18.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"drinkability: well done craft beer from an area of the world that we dont see much. Good to see they are getting into the craft kick too. Nice beer and well crafted. Surprised thi sis only a B-, but it's not hoppy and only hoppy beers get rated good here.","CampusCrew","Sep 24, 2010"
2.82,-18.7,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Overly sweet, buttery toffee, caramel, honey, cloying fruity apple juicebox. Fairly one dimensional as the carbonation just seems to ebb away, leaving it lifeless. This is pretty ho-hum, glad it was a freebie. Thanks Sebastian!","emerge077","Sep 21, 2010"

3.06,-11.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Given the small number of reviews, it looks like Otro Mundo Strong Red Ale isn't available to most of you. Either that or you passed it by for more interesting looking ale. Either way, you aren't missing much.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 05, 2010"
3.41,-1.7,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Not a bad beer. It stands up pretty well with the other English strong ales I've tried, but I probably won't be looking for it again.","kegger22","May 15, 2010"

2.62,-24.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, this beer seems like a maltier and stronger version of their Golden Ale and overall just isn't very good.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 14, 2009"
3.66,5.5,4,3,4,4,3.5,"I was overall very pleased. It poured a clear bright amber with 3 or so fingers of fluffy head and decent retention. It smelled and tasted malty, heavy on the maple/caramel, and light fruits (apples and pears). It was medium and slightly creamy feeling. Good drinkability with 7.5% ABV, but a little too sweet. Still I was pleasantly surprised by this decent beverage.","sophisticated","May 02, 2009"
2.82,-18.7,3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"The aroma is sweet like malt syrup and herbal hops. The appearance is amber gold with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. Its like cereal with maple syrup on it. The palate is average for the style. This has to be one of those beers that could use some help because I get the feeling it has potential.","nick76","Jan 17, 2009"
3.82,10.1,3,3.5,4,3,4.5,"With the sweetness and not heavy feeling after drinking, this beer goes down way to easily for being 7.5% abv","sliverX","Nov 05, 2008"
3.82,10.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a little lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is sweet malty with hints of molasses, unusual red. $4.45 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","May 21, 2008"
3.57,2.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Despite minor criticisms, this is interesting, flavorful and refreshing. I wouldn't die if I never had it again, but I'm glad I took the chance.","Metalmonk","Apr 22, 2008"

2.95,-15,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Something new I am pretty sure I had any Argentininan wares before last night,this big red al poured into a standard pint glass a lighter copper color more than red with a very thin wispy head.Light aromas a bit of toasty grain and caramel not much hop presence here just light malt aromas.A near watery mouthfeel kinda killed this beer not giving any chance of big malty flavors to come thru,mildy sweet with caramel notes as well as some firm toasty notes but its quite blazee.I tried it wont go back to it and likely wont try the gold.","oberon","Mar 30, 2008"
3.07,-11.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"A clean pale orange beer. Has a small fizzy off white head. The aroma starts with a vanilla character that slides into a caramel note with a hint of spice in the background. There is a very watery mouthfeel that masks the flavors. What could be a vanilla caramel note is quickly washed away leaving only a candy like sweetness. Supposed to be 7.5% by vol. but the wateriness seems to hide even that.","ybnorml","Feb 14, 2008"
3.7,6.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D: Really nice drink, very fruity with a rich caramel sweetness which may limit multiples but nice in moderation. A decent surprise from argentina.","beerthulhu","Feb 12, 2008"
