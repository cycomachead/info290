3.44,-0.9,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: This beer is quite drinkable for the style and completely hides any traces of alcohol. It's quite enjoyable, especially if you like aromas and flavors of fruity yeast.","metter98","Nov 15, 2012"
3.46,-0.3,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"O: Caramel/malt bomb with subtle, but perhaps above average, complexity for a red ale.","chinchill","Aug 28, 2012"
3.71,6.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, alcohol. Taste is malty, caramel, slightly sweet, a hint of alcohol, some molasses.. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer.","tone77","Aug 07, 2012"

3.39,-2.3,3,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Taste is slightly meaty raisin & toast, a bit winy, with pleasant grain, caramel-winy character but simple, thin, a bit watery. In the end, it's quite simple, very thin, a bit rough and bland, despite som pleasant elements.","Offa","Mar 10, 2012"

2.76,-20.5,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"O: Overall it feels a bit rough around the edges. Smoothed out and I think it would be a pretty good beer, but right now the harshness of the alcohol i a bit much for me.","Beejay","Feb 06, 2012"
3.32,-4.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"i picked this up because i'm originally from argentina. i had a quilmes once and it was garbage.. i read up on regia and it seemed like it wouldn't be much different, this one though - it stuck out. it wasn't bad, and it was definitely a lot better than the tasteless quilmes lager i had.","facundoCNB","Jan 15, 2012"

3.78,8.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Here is a very European red ale. It's a very clear amber color, with an off-white head. The aroma is all malt...with a touch of yeast and alcohol. Slight toast, biscuit...very sweet...almost a honey-like scent. The taste is similar. Lots of malt, balance to the sweet side with serious malt flavor. Not really roasted, but rather toasted and bread-crust. Firm mouthfeel. Again, very European in it's feel.","Suds","Jun 22, 2011"
