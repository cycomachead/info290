4.04,7.2,3.75,4,4,4.5,4,"o: An excellent ESB, very drinkable and full of malty goodness, with just enough slightly bitter fruit notes to keep the malt from being overly sweet.  I would definitely buy this again.","scotorum","Jan 24, 2015"
3.83,1.6,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O- Another great brew from Wynchwood. Lots of great characteristics that are typical of an English style Bitter. Malt forward but complimented nicely with a slight bitterness. Wynchwood's Hobgoblin is much more flavourful in my opinion but King Goblin is quite similar but with that added alcohol kick. I recommend.","PorterPro125","Jan 23, 2015"

3.73,-1.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"This is a malt forward beer with notes of cookie, honey, toffee, and some toasted grains. The hops is very subdued but tastes of grass and herbs. The yeast lends flavors of dough and earth. The scents of cookie, toffee, toasted grains and earth are noticeable when bringing the glass to your mouth.","CincyBrewTull","Jan 15, 2015"
