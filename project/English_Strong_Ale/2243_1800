3.73,6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Single 330 ml bottle poured into a tulip. A flat reddish brown with a finger or just a hair under of bright beige foam, somewhere between frothy and creamy.  Sweet malt and fruit aroma with a dash of floral, woody hops ... A toffee and nutty bread base ornamented with raisins and pears. Surprisingly light bodied, at least subjectively speaking, and moderately fizzy, but delivers a big brown sugar, orchard fruit, and brown bread flavor with some added herbal hops. Pears and old brown apples, peach, pretzels, a dry woodiness, and a decent bloom of alcohol. Maybe skews more bready and woody than sweet per se. Finish is dry, more wood and alcohol. A wee bit of oxidation that does not detract. Its English all right but not as rich and redolent as the true classics. Nice of them to print the constituents on the label. The grain bill resembles that of a stout qualitatively if not quantitatively. The hop bill explains the rustic herbal notes.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 01, 2014"

3.68,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, pear, toast, brown sugar, light roast, bread, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, raisin, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, bread, toffee, light roast, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/woody bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, raisin, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, bread, toffee, light roast, herbal, woodiness, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, lightly creamy, and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Engish strong ale. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. This bottle was lightly oxidized, but was a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 23, 2014"
