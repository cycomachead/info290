3.85,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste wise: it was again malty and fruity, a drier hop bitterness comes late on the palate but this is a primary a malty brew. Body depth is good and the alcohol sits well within the whole feel.","BlackHaddock","Nov 28, 2011"
4.32,12.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5," Took a flyer on this single pint while buying other things and went back within a week to get several more as they went down great at a summer pig roast right from the bottle. Love a good hearty English brew especially the darker stuff, where I feel the English stuff really shines. Recommended!","Blueribbon666","Oct 16, 2011"

4.08,6.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A classic English ale with lots of big maltiness and great esters. The light hop character adds a nice dry finish. Very good.","dgilks","Dec 21, 2010"
3.55,-7.6,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Not a bad beer. Could have been a little denser. I also prefer my strong ales to be stronger in the ABV.","shanblur","Nov 14, 2010"
4.07,6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A nice beer, and a slightly more elaborate one than you often get from a British brewery. While I appreciate a really good mild English ale every now and then, I'd prefer one like this with just that little bit more oomph.","lacqueredmouse","Sep 02, 2010"
3.83,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"i've never seen this beer on shelves in Toledo, so I was glad to have a chance to try it at the One 2 Lounge in Sylvania Friday night.","Brenden","May 18, 2010"
3.77,-1.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"It feels good to get away from the hops after a pint of Monkey Wrench. Imagine what the high definition version (cask) would yield.","DoubleJ","Feb 19, 2010"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown color with a decent head of foam as you take in the scents of malts with a hint of chocolate. It drinks much like a stout as it has that thicker and heavier taste to it. Nicely made and finishes rather smoothly. Something to try if you like heavier beers.","Lemke10","Jan 29, 2010"
3.78,-1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Great lacing on this mahogany colored beer. The aroma is a soft mix of malt, baking bread, yeast, and earth. Nice flavor...fairly dry, with a mineral-water and carbonic feel. Plenty of malt in the taste as well. Touch of butterscotch. The long-lasting malt-centric finish.","Suds","Nov 27, 2009"
4.18,8.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Quite nice overall the taste had a couple issues but overall it was quite nice, it looked felt and drank wonderfully.","MBPChead","Oct 29, 2009"
3.74,-2.6,3,4,4,3,3.5,"Decent beer. Poured with a tan head that quickly settled down and no lace. Color is a lovely clear medium red amber. Aroma is very malty roast toffee and a hint fruity. Flavor is like aroma. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and medium in length. Serviceable beer. If you were in the mood for a straightforward malty ale this could be a session.","drpimento","Sep 16, 2009"
4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A quite light body, with a low soft carboantion make sfor an easy drink!","dqrull","Sep 06, 2009"
3.23,-15.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability: Average but accessible, though one I'll have to pass. I enjoyed the monkey shenanigans story on the label more than anything else.","ChainGangGuy",
