3.32,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The Saints is an excellent way to wean someone onto scotch. With only one real feature (peatiness), however, it is hardly the long storyteller that a good single malt is. But it does offer at least a superficial taste of what distinguishes many of the finest whiskeys, albeit without any of the complexity, elegance or alcohol burn. St. Peter's is hit and miss and this offering could fall on either side depending on your tastes.","biegaman","Oct 20, 2012"

3.16,0.3,2.5,4,3,2.5,3,"Deep yellow coloured, without a head. The aroma is big peat whiskey whiskey and wood, and that's what I get in the taste. Highly carbonated, not so drinkable, like a cheap watered down whiskey. Why drink it at all, I could not. At least it was not high abv.LCBO acquisition. Brewed OK for what it is. Big whiskey fans may like this, good luck.","Sammy","Oct 15, 2012"

2.63,-16.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,2,"Reddish orange with some forced white bubbles as a head - low carbonation it appears. Nose has some skunk/weed initially (green bottles?), with strong peat, earth and burnt firewood upon closer inspection. Taste rehashes this, a ton of peat, smoke and light malt character. Really intense and off-putting. Light breadiness in the malt. Light body, bitter and lingering peat. I can take these flavours in moderation but this is way over the top for the mood I'm in. Drainpour.","liamt07","Sep 25, 2012"

3.32,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O - I really liked the smokey peat notes, but the ashy finish was definitely a turnoff. Worth a try and a brew that would receive a wide ranging reviews given the flavour profile. I wouldn't buy it again, but I'm glad I tried it nonetheless.","andrenaline","Sep 21, 2012"
