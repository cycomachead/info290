3.39,-7.9,2,3,3.5,3.5,4,"D- Quite drinkable, but I would like a touch more balance rather than a flash of bitterness at the finish.","MbpBugeye","Oct 18, 2008"
3.56,-3.3,2.5,4,4,2.5,3,"This was $3.99 for a pint, or basically about $18.00 for a six pack. At that price level this beer should have me saying WOW. At that price, however, it only had me saying GEE!","jadpsu","Aug 24, 2008"
3.65,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"While I found this one interesting, it's not one of my favorite English ales. I'd love to try it again on tap and see if the taste is different in draught form, but maybe I'll try other Otter beers and see if those are more my speed.","kylesobrien","Aug 18, 2008"
4.23,14.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"From the 1 pt. 0.9 fl. oz. bottle and sampled on July 11, 2009. It pours amber-brown with a thin beige head. The carbonation bubbles clung to the side of the pint glass and gave off an appearance not unlike tiny ice crystals although it was served at about 40 degrees. They say that it is brewed with spring water and perhaps that was the reason for this unique look. The aroma was sweet and malty with a tinge of fruit in the background. The mouthfeel was in the medium range with the smooth texture of honey. A good English bitter taste with a slightly dry finish. Overall tasty and true to my favorite style.","puboflyons","Jun 19, 2008"

4.18,13.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D- ice cold it may be quenching and un-noticeable but i'm goin british tonight and this otter is rife with character and nutritious goodness. my only gripe is the addition of wheat, oats, and spelt which add more flavor but ultimately blend things together a little too much for me. i like crisp lines. for what it is though, a superb pub drink.","hustlesworth","Mar 23, 2008"
3.67,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Caramel nose. Flavor is sweet caramel that changes to a slight bitter finish. $4.35 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. Style is more like a sweet ESB than an English strong ale.","jdhilt","Mar 06, 2008"
3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Smooth and slippery in the mouth, broken up by a zing of carbonation.","cvstrickland","Mar 02, 2008"
3.39,-7.9,3.5,4.5,3,3,3,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- although thinly weighted, the beer's carbonation is a bit rough... especially in the swallow. At $4.50 a bottle, this doesn't warrant another purchase. Glad to have tried it, though.","yelterdow","Jan 13, 2008"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall- A tasty Ale that seemed stronger than the 5.8% abv. This following a Hoppy Otter is nice!","NJpadreFan","Oct 14, 2007"
4.1,11.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours an orange/brown color with a Head retention and lacing are both low. Aroma is nice, it smells like caramel, bread/dough, toffee, and dried fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, starts off malty and then the hops come out in the finish and linger around for a while. Mouthfeel/body is medium and creamy, with low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I don't know if I'd call this a Strong Ale, but I'm not complaining. Overall I think it's a good beer, I'd definitely buy it again.","bluejacket74","Oct 01, 2007"

3.63,-1.4,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"This one was completely new to me, but I am glad I tried it... Worth a shot, although it is certainly not the best depiction of the style out there...","dsa7783","Sep 18, 2007"
3.83,4.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"For my money, Fuller's 1845 and Adnams Broadside Strong Original are still the cream of the English strong ale crop. Otter Head, while good, isn't a beer that I'm tempted to give another go 'round. It's still worth a look for anyone interested in the style.","BuckeyeNation",
