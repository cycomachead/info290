Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt, dark fruit, and brandy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody and spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Aroma was my favorite part of the beer; subtle blend of oak, cinnamon, apple, plum, nutmeg, molasses and all things Christmas. Flavor is much drier and less sweet than expected. Cinnamon is fairly strong though out and cuts the sweetness of the brandy barrel nicely. Plums, figs, apples and light cherry fruit flavors throughout and a dry, oaky finish.

Figs, apricot, vanilla, maple syrup, and leather dominate, with some alcohol bite and mild bitterness to balance an enduring sweetness. The mouthfeel is where this shines, exceptional medium body and smoothness. Drinkability is good with the booziness and the abv preventing more consumption.

One to two years would do wonders for this brew. Other notes of vanilla, apples, bitter-sweet molasses, and ripe fruits. The yeast played like champagne, creating a very dry finish and a bit of carbonation on the tongue.","boMD","Nov 24, 2010"

For now, just seek out a bottle (or a pour: only 64 cases produced and limited kegs) - you won't be disappointed.","msubulldog25","Beers"
4.47,14,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a pretty amber color with orange highlights, without much of a head. Sweet aroma of pale malt, candi sugar, a whiff of molasses and brandy, and tons of sweet, ripe figs. Palate is sweet throughout - molasses sweetness and candied figs, with a hint of cinnamon. Body is rich and pretty creamy, with some very light carbonation to provide a little lift. Finish is sweet and warm from the considerable alcohol content. Very tasty and complex, although I'd like to see what a few months in the cellar could do for it.","ElGordo","0"
