4.15,11,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall - this is a very tasty beer, nothing complex or overpowering but delivers on flavour. and even though it seemed very carbonated when poured after drinking over half i had no excess gas or boating which seemed likely. would have again when looking for something smooth to relax.","shearer292","Mar 03, 2010"
3.8,1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D: This is a solid drinking ale. However, I found humor in this being styled as "Enlish Strong Ale."","bucklemyshoe","Oct 31, 2009"

3.41,-8.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is bready with some lighter fruit. The flavor is grain, grassy hops and earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, but not to much going on.","Mora2000","Aug 13, 2009"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A tasty, easy to drink English ale. Plenty of malt character and a good fruitiness.","dgilks","Aug 04, 2009"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A very drinkable and well balanced beer. I will definitely purchase this one again.","Thehuntmaster","Jul 21, 2009"
4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"From bottle. Pours a medium, mostly clear amber with slight off-white head. Definite nose of fruits, honey and caramel malt. Very well done brew, well balanced with hops and malt presence, but neither overbearing. Lacing throughout. A very enjoyable beer with medium body. Not too sweet, not too fruity, not too dry - Just perfectly bitter for my taste. Very surprised at the great taste since this is from bottle and not cask. CHEERS to Thwaites!","OzarkElmo","Jun 11, 2009"
3.45,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer pours a pale see thru amber colour with average carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head with sporadic lacing here and there,it has big aromas of nice fruity hops,it has an average mouthfeel with a very dominant fruity hop driven taste that finishes quite sweet for the style with a barleywinish finish and no hint of alcohol whatsoever,a very easy beer to drink that wouldnt go out of my way for but wouldnt knock back if offered.","ADZA","Apr 17, 2009"
3.85,2.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"More intricate than the average English strong ale, and the hops make it a good summer drinker to boot.","StJamesGate","Dec 29, 2008"
3.78,1.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Great drinkability, I could stay on this for 3+ pints no problem. Not a great English Strong Ale but worth a try","russpowell","Sep 09, 2008"

Especially those from the Lake District of England approaching his beloved Scotland. Ah Scotland - home to men in skirts (kilts) and those fine winter wee heavies...","ProfessorHomer",
