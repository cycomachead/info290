3.88,14.8,4,4,3.75,3.75,4,"2013 vintage enjoyed in a snifter, this interesting English imperial red pours a bright reddish amber with a thick, big bubbled white head that lingers with light lacing.  Nose of toffee, caramel, ripe peaches, cherries, and strong booze.  Flavors are intense to say the least.  Rich caramel and spicy rye like flavors come through on the front and sides with a mild toffee background.  Fruit flavors roar on the aftertaste and back with peach and cherry notes being tamed by spicy hops.  Booze runs rampant through this rather big ale with considerable heat.  Reminds me of some of the Russian alcohol forward dopplebocks, yet with more depth and character.  Very nice indeed.","Brutaltruth","Dec 22, 2014"
3.04,-10.1,3.5,3.25,2.75,3.5,3,"11.2 ounce bottle, 2013 vintage, label stamp says best before 16 09 23.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with maybe a quarter inch off-white head that didn't stay around for very long.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  The aroma starts off boozy, with some toffee, candied oranges, stone fruit and some caramel malt noticeable.  The taste is mainly sweet and boozy, it tastes like dried fruit (stone fruit and dark fruit), booze, and bready malt.  The booziness just seems worse the longer I drink this, and unfortunately so does the overall flavor of this brew.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's syrupy and coating with moderate carbonation.  This isn't bad, but it wasn't exactly good either.  Maybe it needs more age on it, who knows.  It's worth trying once, but I likely wouldn't buy this again.","bluejacket74","Dec 20, 2014"

3.87,14.5,3.75,3.5,4,4.5,3.75,"a nice and dry English Ale, a little booze taste but considering the 11.8% abv not bad at all. the Rye malt is very pleasant and strong. I should mention that the bottle I purchased in December of 2014 is from 2010 so maybe this beer needs some time to mature before it's true potential is reached","ScentedHeathen","Nov 14, 2014"

2.99,-11.5,,,,,,"Pours a bright orange with an off white head. The smell is all alcohol with only some light fruit smells coming through in the end. The taste is very sweet in the beginning before giving in to a lot of burn from the booze. It was very heavy and boozy but drinkable. If nothing else it gets you drunk really fast.","WhiteHillsStore","Sep 07, 2014"
