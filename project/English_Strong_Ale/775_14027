This beer shouldn't be aged and those that have and then have unfairly rated it should be ashamed. If I came on here and slated an aged bottle of pliny then I'd get slated in return, so why is this any different. To quote a previous reviewer. 'suck it'.","paxton1978","Nov 21, 2011"

3.92,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: Is this the same, damn-near life-changing beer I had back in 2005 on cask at the York Brewery? Well, not quite. I managed to pop into the brewery this past summer to grab a half-pint after a whirlwind tour of York's city center, and I thought it was pretty good, if not remarkable. I also had a bottle this summer in York and it was...meh. This, on the other hand (I believe from a fresher batch) is really quite tasty, if, as I said, a bit more bitter than I'd like for the style.","BedetheVenerable","Oct 19, 2011"

1.86,-51.8,1.5,3,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Overall: This beer is 13 years old and I can't believe I had the chance to actually drink this. This is one of those beers that I never thought I would be able to try but thanks to MrVonzipper I got the chance and I am eternally in his debt. Oh yeah the beer SUCKS","DarthKostrizer","Jun 26, 2010"

4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"An excellent ale - I reckon this to be the best of York brewery's fine offerings. It has a rich flavour that would round off a session nicely. Well worth seeking out...","jazzyjeff13","Feb 06, 2010"
4.28,10.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I really enjoyed this a lot on cask at the Brick Store Pub. Gravity pour as well, which was nice. Pours a beautiful very dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights. Has a relatively thick pancake head that is off-white. Some nice lacing. Smells grainy, including a touch of grain sourness, as well as some gentle cocoa and roasted notes. Perhaps a little touch of coffee as well. The taste is really very nice- rich and full, but smooth and creamy, with a pleasant light nuttiness, more cocoa notes, and some very light creamy roastiness. Sweet and creamy on the finish with some light earthy hops. There is a touch of copper throughout, as well as some subdued dried fruit. Very pleasant. Pleasantly smooth and creamy in the mouth, and just wonderful overall.","Georgiabeer",
