The hops are bitter but not over-the-top aromatic and provide a fine counter-balance to its essentially malty character.

A big dose of graineyness hovering over a very light bed of spicey noble hop. The feel was light and bubbly. Very refreshing on a summer night on the patio of our local watering hole.

Not as crisp as I would like a pilsner to be, but well balanced for what it is. The mouthfeel is light with nice carbonation. Overall, it is not the best German pilsner I've had, but it isn't bad either.

It is safe to say, I don't think too highly of these other beers I have compared to the Veltins. These are the Bud, Millers, Coors of Germany/ Czech Rep.
