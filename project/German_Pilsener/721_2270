The taste brings much of the same with a bit of yeast and grass.  It almost finishes as soon as it hit your tongue with a crisp dryness.  Honestly doesn't taste like much.

I'd buy this over Bud, Miller, Coors, PBR, Corona, or even Heineken. I don't know if we in American can get the cans, but I'd say buy cans for a more pure taste.

3.27,8.6,3.25,3,3.5,3,3.25,"Had a bottle at a Calgary Pub in the Kensington area with dinner, poured into a pub glass. Looks darker than many other Euro lagers, a yellow to just shy of amber hue with a smattering of white bubbles. Smells like grainy pale malt, grassy and slightly spicy hops, skunk, and a decent whiff of sulphur. Palate features a light cracker malt backbone, some DMS, green grassy hops, subdued lemon and lime rind, white grape notes, and a noticeable but reduced residual sweetness compared to many of its Euro pale lager cousins; perhaps this is what earns it a bona-fide pils designation. Very fizzy and light-bodied as one would expect, yet reasonably creamy and smooth. Not too bad all things considered. The usual flaws found in green-bottled mass market imports are reduced or absent. Considerably better than Heineken (to name but one example) even if it remains pretty mainstream in overall feel.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 05, 2014"

This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises mild funky wheat, light skunk, dry wheat, and vague grasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the skunk thankfully replaced by hard water. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, this doesn't taste too far off from every other mass-produced Euro lager out there, though the grassiness does help it a bit in my eyes. That said, I'm not likely to have too many more of these in the future.","TMoney2591","Oct 06, 2013"

The head of the beer tastes very metallic. The taste is more metallic than most canned beers, but it also offers a really nice hoppy taste. It's very standard for a pilsner, but there aren't too many flaws either. Honestly, the bottled version is far superior to the canned one since it doesn't have the metallic taste. I'll say : this is the first time a canned beer for me has had this noticeable of a metallic taste to it. Perhaps I'll review the bottled version another day (or even better, on tap), but it's just... average. Oh well, I'm totally drinking it again for nostalgia's sake.","Olek4374","Jun 11, 2013"

I Cracked it open and after marveling at its fullness, began a standard Glug, still resulting in a massive amount of dense, eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see into the future. Tomorrow looks to be a nice day outside with me stuck inside for most of it and no beer to dull the pain. Nose smelled like lager, the pleasant kind, with a honey-like sweetness and just a kiss of hops, to borrow from an old advertising slogan. I am not taking the piss, either. I have been subjected to so many shite lagers in CANs over these last several years that I have come to really enjoy a simple, adjunct (read, corn)-free lager when one happens my way. Mouthfeel was soft, not quite creamy, but without the kind of forced carbonation that seems to want to scrub my tongue. The taste was mild and unassuming, slightly grassy, mildly sweet and much like everything that belonged to Baby Bear - just right. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. I CAN easily see myself hanging out in the backyard, grabbing some of these out of a cooler and making a day of it. I CANnot speak for it from a bottle, but out of a CAN, it was just the ticket as a nightcap.","woodychandler","Apr 09, 2013"

4,32.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at 4Q Danish cafe in Yurakucho, Tokyo. Poured into a Carlsberg pint glass. Clear, light gold hue with a thick beautiful white head. The smell of hops and nuts comes off this pils in a wonderfully unexpected way. The taste follows the smell adequately, and the mouthfeel was smooth yet memorable. Overall, this changed my opinion about Carlsberg which I had only previously tried from the bottle. I enjoyed Carlsberg Gold very much in Singapore, and now I can say that Carlsberg from the tap is a quality pilsner beer.","shigg85","Jun 23, 2012"

It is fairly crisp overall but the aftertaste and sweetness is what just doesn't do it for me. However you want to swing it... pilsner or euro lager, it doesn't matter.

There is a reason it has its own strain of yeast named for it (s. carlsbergensis). Definitely quite unlike any other beer I've had, very intriguing.

Clear gold in colour, leaning more towards the lighter side, but a ways from being pale like straw. The aroma is pretty good as well, deep bready malt underneath sweet grains, with a small presence of grassy hops. A lager with a couple layers of aroma, not too shabby. Ooops, and then I took a sip and wrecked that pretty picture. I'm trying to discern whether it's the grains or the yeast that are guilty of giving off that bitter/sour flavour. The aftertaste would point more directly to the grains. It starts off unsassuming enough, crisp grain, and then you get sucker punched by sour grains in the middle, and after that you forget why you were drinking this in the first place. No hops to greet you at the finish, they were frightened off long ago by this off-flavour monster which instead dons the hop's glasses and nightgown, waiting for you, Red Ridinghood, to catch you off guard and pounce on you once again. And it lingers... I had this rated a bit higher for taste until the aftertaste hit me. And yet through all of that torment with the flavour, the mouthfeel is quite good for a lager, light and creamy smooth, I wish most macro lagers had this sort of mouthfeel (well, and better taste as well....). In fact this is a decent lager on most counts, except for the flavour, which of course is where everyone lays down their money. And because of that, aside from it's other better attributes, makes this beer far less drinkable than it actually should be, I know I won't be picking up any more of this.

The taste, thankfully, isn't skunky, and is comprised of light bready malt notes and grassy hop flavor. Hop bitterness is light, but is sufficient enough to provide ample balance for malt sweetness.
