3.25,-14.2,,,,,,"Just a touch of haze in a deep straw colored liquid, topped with a creamy bubbly bone white head that persists forever leaving lots of stickies on the sides of the glass. Crackery bready malt aromas are nicely balanced with a bit of spicy floral hop. Light sulfur rounds out the nose. The flavor is rich bready crackery pilsner malt with spicy hop to counter. Slight metallic flavor towards the end is a bit off putting. I can imagine that this was a better beer when fresher, but I just noticed that this can is best by July 2014. Still no excuse for the metallic flavor. I will rate as is and hopefully get a chance to sample again.","johnnnniee","Sep 14, 2014"

Lots of malt flavor at first followed up by some of the cut grass. Toasted bready malts with hints of wheat and hay. Finishes with a light bitterness along with some floral notes. Good amount of body with lots of carbonation. A can of this is perfect for the summer. Overall, worth getting again.","PicoPapa","Jun 30, 2014"

Light creamy smooth feel down the middle with tangy, assertive carbonation on the edges. Flavor is a wonderful balance of bready and biscuity malt and herbal hop flavors. Hop flavors turn a bit spicy through the middle along with a lightly citrus tang. Finishes dryly and crisply with a lingering herbal hop bitterness.

Crisp hoppy aroma. Nice crisp hop flavor with a light malt accent. Easy drinking and refreshing. This is like 85 Prima Pils to me.

Smells of grainy sweet malts, some lager yeast smells that I still can't describe very well. Earthy hops come through in the finish for a nice balance to the malts. Thin bodied, medium high carbing. I'm going to enjoy this one and may more if and when I go back to NY to pick some up. Overall a good beer and very portable. $2.15 a single.","Homebrew35","Mar 29, 2011"

Flavor is a bitter semi sweet mix of malts and hops but finishes a bit heavier with the earthy herbal noble hops. Malt is lightly sweet with a biscuit malt and grassy note. Finishes with a slight metallic note giving an earthy mineral content to the whole experience. Mouthfeel overall has light feel to it with herbal grassy hops provideing a dry finish.

There was nothing more in the aroma than just the malts and hops. It was just your basic Pilsner aroma. This Pilsner is dry with dried floral hops and just a touch of malt. It was like the aroma, but what it lacked in flavors, the spicy bitter hops taste made up the difference. The mouthfeel was light with a refreshing bitter aftertaste of dried floral hops.

This one was bright yellow and transparent. The head was stark white, rocky and HUGE! The smell was earthy and slightly like baked bread (yeast anyone?). The flavor is subtle and crisp.

Nice light lemon and grass flavors, with a hint of yeast and grain. The taste was just great, smooth, big carbonation made it very refreshing. Very very hoppy for a pilsner with a nice pine resin flavor and hints of grapefruit, and pineapple and lemon. Big dry finish that was nice and bitter.

Solid looking brew. Nose is dominated by a very nice herbal and floral halertau hop, with a lighter crisp and lightly sweet pilsner malt behind it. It seems a touch light, and I'd like a bit more of what is already there. The flavor is really working for me. Initially it delivers a very solid floral hop, with just a hint of very lightly grainy pilsner malt sweetness behind it, moving to a more herbal blast from the hop intertwined with a very clean and enticing bitterness. It is slightly skewed towards the hop, but I really enjoy the hop character that this one presents. It makes me want to brew a nice old world pilsner. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a solid moderate carbonation. I would definately keep this one around if it were available around here.

4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a really solid Pils, a style I am starting to warm up to. The pour on this was a slightly clouded golden yellow with a one fingered head that only stuck around for a sip or two. The smell showed a nice hop backbone with citrus and herbal/grassy scents lingering. The taste was clean and crisp with a nice balanced flavor that made you realize that not all Pils are created equal. This one clearly is a cut above with a slightly hoppy profile that doesn't overwhelm, nicely complimenting the crisp body of this beer.","NolanGTI","Mar 13, 2006"
4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Crystal clear yellow/gold with a rocky white head. Decent retention and spotty lacing. Clean grain aroma with plenty of floral hops and light citrus character. These qualities carry into the flavour, but are balanced by a solid bitterness and hint of earthiness in the hops. Light body with generous, crisp carbonation. Well attenuated. This is a really good lager with plenty of hop character. Nicely done!","DrJay","Mar 08, 2006"
3.95,4.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"All the flavors are subtle--sweet biscuits, bread, hops with a tinge of citrus. This is a very traditional interpretation of a pilsner, executed with skill and precision. A minor nitpick is that the taste, as foreshadowed by the smell, has a dry, grassy overtone that takes the beer down a notch...a small notch. I'm not crazy about Pilsner Urquell, at least the version available in the States, but people say it's much better in Europe, where it's fresh. Sly Fox Pikeland Pils tastes the way I imagine that a fresh Pils Urquell tastes.","GnomeKing","Mar 08, 2006"
4.22,11.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Good beer in a can, what will they think of next? The Pikeland Pils poured a light yellow color with a medium white head that stayed around while I drank it. The aroma was nice and citrusy with a bit of malt. The taste is lemony, maybe some grapefruit, refreshing. This is a smooth and drinkable pils and another good selection from Sly Fox.","ggaughan","Feb 22, 2006"
4.09,7.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Don't skip out on this one just because it's a pilsner. It's a winner, and it won't disappoint.","monkeybutler","Nov 07, 2005"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The mouth feel was light and slightly sticky with a small tingly carbonation.","DarkerTheBetter","Aug 28, 2005"
4.38,15.6,5,4.5,4,4,5,"Clear bright golden hue is quickly the foundation to a siperb foamy white head that lasts forever. Fair toasted and bready malts serve as a base to the wondrous floral hops that characterize this beer. Leafy, lemony, herbal: vibrant hoppiness that emerge from the glass and brings you straight to Germany through a very dry portal. Citric in mouth, but in the course of a mineral and very crisp interplay, which makes it all work nicely.. Ahhh those flowery saaz. Light-medium bodied, extremely engaging carbonation. Remarkable pilsner!","Rastacouere","Jan 15, 2005"
4.56,20.3,5,4,4.5,5,5,"Drinkable? Very much so. This is a beer you want more and more of.","GeoffFromSJ","Nov 16, 2004"
4.5,18.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An incredible pilsener, to say the least. This fine, fine example of this style, presented itself before my eyes with a light, white-as-snow bubbly head, which quickly faded to a light lace along the side of the glass. One smell of this gem of a pilsener filled my mind with thought of fresh cut grass and herbal maltiness. An incredible tasting brew, the crispness on the palate was just one of this brews redeeming factors. I almost felt as if I could taste and.or experience each and every ingredient put into this work of art. While somewhat dry on its finish with a hint of bitter bite, this is still the classic German-style Pils I always love to try again and again.","goindownsouth","Aug 24, 2004"
4.48,18.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Bright, somewhat cloudy golden witha nice cap of the white stuff. The Aroma is very fruity, and filled with boat-loads of hops (saaz and a blend of a few others?). There is also a nice lemon tang in the aroma as well. The tastre is all saaz and lemon up front, slightly fruity and biscuit-like in the middle, and hoppy and slightly dry and spritzy in the finish. The mouthfeel is spritzy, refreshing, and alive and the drinkability is very, very, very good! A killer keller ;-)","francisweizen","Jun 27, 2004"
3.23,-14.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Taste was light and slightly bitter towards then end. I definitely got the sensation of grapefruit juice and other citrus when I was tasting this beer. This Pils had a nice mouthfeel, but I thought it had a bit too much carbonation. In the end, I felt a little disappointed with this beer because I was expecting something tasting more like Pilsner Urquell...but despite this I finished off the growler anyway!","tomthumbsblues","Jun 24, 2004"
3.42,-9.8,3,3.5,3,4,4,"On tap at the Drafting Room. Poured out clear and light golden with white head of tiny bubbles that left a thin covering and light ring. The scent was mainly vineous. Tastes very dry, making it very drinkable. Bitter and yummy, piney. Leaves taste of hops on your tongue. Good brew.","shapudding","Jun 09, 2004"
3.7,-2.4,3,3,4,4,4,"Beer is good. Happy beering.","blitheringidiot","Jun 03, 2004"
4.36,15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The color is more bronze in nature to me. Carbonation is wonderful. Very small bubbles whic support a nice white head. Nice lace as one drinks it down. The nose to me is somewhere between being spice and fruit. It is very subtle and the hop character is detected in the nose. Very crisp clean finish. I could drink it all day.","maybrick","Jan 01, 2004"
4.42,16.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I picked up a sixtel of this and the Cascade IPA because I've been so impressed by Sly Fox brews thus far.... I'm even more so now. This pours a cloudy, light blonde color which is very hazy and has a sticky cloud-white head with nice lacing all down the glass. The smell is lemons, lime, grass, straw, flowery hops and sweet malts. The taste was surprisingly raw to me --- this is only my second "keller" pils. You can taste a lemony tartness which really gives this pils a nice kick. The mouthfeel is very crisp and dry with a hard bite that is really, really bitter in a good way --- something completely different from you standard pils, but I could imagine a filtered version of this as well. I'm not sure what the ABV is on this one (5% or so) but the drinkability level is very high. Think lemonade on a hot summer day, wheat beer like refreshing quality and all natural ingredients and style...","Gasp100","Sep 15, 2003"
3.5,-7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cloudy hazy light peach color in the glass. Some small bubbles of carbonation and a slight white head. Not much nose, just a slight malt sweetness in the nose. Sweet malt taste with an astringent hop finish. Quite clean tasting. Lively carbonation swirls around the tongue creates a lively mouth. Sweet malt coating finish.","frank4sail","May 26, 2003"
4.27,12.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the best Pilsners I have had to date. The balance of flavors is impeccable. Has a spicier-than-most-pilsners hop character, which hits you right at the start, leading to a delicious piney, malty middle. Finishes dry and rather bitter, with the hops still making themselves known. A great Pils!","IrishRedRock","Apr 07, 2003"
3.98,5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I had tried the "Keller" style once before and enjoyed it so I figured I would give it a try,poured a nice unfiltered deep golden color with nice big rocky head.Very buttery taste with a good malt background,not a wimpy beer by any means,very easy to drink.A nice hand crafted brew you dont see very often,well done.","oberon","Mar 03, 2003"
4.53,19.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer was part of a sampler at the Brewery. Poured a clear golden pale yellow color. Very crisp and as for a Pilsner, the taste is dead on. Everything that I enjoy in a Pils is here  Nice hop bite, clear, bright golden and effervescent. Very dry with a nice clean aftertaste. A very drinkable and high quality Pilsner beer.","pezoids","Dec 27, 2002"
4.42,16.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I believe that the Pikeland Pils is also served unfiltered as the Keller Pils; and it took a Gold medal at the GABF in 2000. It's brewed in the North German style and utilizes 100% German Pilsener malt alongside a combination of German and Czech hops to 44 IBU's. Its clear golden body is topped by a foamy, bright-white head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace before settling to a creamy collar and whispy surface covering. The nose displays a bouquet of boldly floral and spicy hops that are alive like the aromas of a late spring morning following a soft rain. Very vivid and lush! The body is light and combines with a fine/median carbonation to give a crisp mouthfeel. The flavor displays an aggressive combination of solid maltiness and bold hoppiness. The bitterness hits swift and hard up-front; and acts as a rock solid foundation for the firm malt and richly floral, spicy and mildly grassy hops that follow. It finishes dry with a mild residual bitterness. Clearly, a full-throttle pils that pulls no punches and satisfies from start to finish! Although hop-heads will assuredly be impressed with this beer, it's got enough balance, finesse, and floral hop character to attract a variety of drinkers. Exceptionally well-done and quite enjoyable!","NeroFiddled","Beers"
4.29,13.2,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Not a traditional Pils by any measure. Pours a quite cloudy yellow with a pretty substantial white head. Quite sweet with a nice dry crisp finish. Mouthfeel was quite good with a big body for the style. I had a tough time rating this one as they clearly think that it should be a pils, but there are so many things here that do not fit the style. Instead of penalizing, I rated the beer based on my enjoyment of it. Truly an interesting beer that should be the first one ordered when you visit.","jreitman","0"
