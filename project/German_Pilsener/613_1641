A great afternoon or evening brew when you are being involved with athletic activities on the weekend and don't want to be weighed down with a heavy german lager. (Leisure athletic activities with friends of course, bocce, horseshoes, etc ). Goes with most BBQ foods like an North American pilsner would, U.S. or mexican.

3.68,7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 4/26/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good clean balance of pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice clean balance and solid robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a nice German pilsener style. All around clean balance and solid robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 02, 2014"

I detect a nice hop aroma at first, however, as the thin white lace subsides and I get further along in the drink its a mostly malty aroma. Taste and feel are very clean, malty, bready but very little hops bite or bitterness. Low carbonation. Has neither the spicy quality or the hops kick of other continental pilsners I enjoy.

For some reason I can only keep down imported beer. I thought it was going to taste bad since it was so cheap...but I was surprised that it was quite pleasant tasting. My favorite beer is Stella ...and Sapporo (Japanese beer). This one rates somewhere in the middle, being very refreshing and has a kick to it that says... you are drinking beer!! not flavored water :-). I recommend drinking it very cold. It's great with comfort and fast foods and I will be looking for it again...I hope the price remains this low, as it will be my regular basic go to beer.

I drank this through a keg and didn't enjoy it as much as I do now. I would compare this to Konig pilsner, although Konig is much better, this is trying to keep pace. Nice cool refreshing beer. Smell some vanilla, grass, almost candy like. Beer changes in smell as it warms for the better. More of a hop odor to it.Very nice carbonation and straw like color.

Poured into a pint glass, the beer reveals an pale straw-yellow and forms a unusually frothy head that leaves sticky lacing all over. Subtle grassy scents and citrus are packaged in a bready bouquet. The palate is slightly malt-forward and crackery, quickly dried by hop essence. There are few nuanced flavors, and the light and bubbly mouthfeel doesn't help matters. Short, dry finish...this brew highlights the boring side of Reinheitsgebot.","rand","Jun 17, 2013"

The nose was a light malty sweetness, as expected from a good pils. The taste of the beer was good and it followed the nose, but with a hint of spice, which was probably attributed to the hops.

The taste was similar, though better, the metallic taste wasn't as present as I would've thought, though the citrus smells weren't as present in the taste. It starts off fairly bitter and ends with a nice dry, bitter finish. The mouthfeel was perfect, moderate carbonation and very, very refreshing.

Carbonation is good as bubbles are flowing up from the bottom of the glass. Nice aroma, grainy malt scent with some slight hops that seem to give off lemon and a slightly medicine smell. The flavor is good, seems to be a refreshing brew, nice real summer brew because of the lightness, crispness, carbonation and sweet malt and lemon flavors from the hops. I am glad that I picked this brew up, nice to get a understanding of what a Pilsner should be, will be one that I will try to get friends to try this as I think this could be a nice break from some of the macro stuff that they insist on.

The smell is somewhat bitter, but not at all herbal like many other traditional German Pils. This beer goes down smooth with a little bitterness, but that should be expected when drinking a Pils. The trick with this beer is to NOT drink it immediately after pouring. The Germans whom I encountered recommended that it is proper to let the beer sit for 7 minutes before drinking. The appropriate glassware also helps to amplify the taste. Bitburger should not be consumed in anything other than a tulip glass or a pokal; anything else would be a sin.

The taste starts off with some floral hops that give way to some of the citrus with some lemon and grapefruit flavors that end with a little sweet malt.

Taste is similar, sweet and malty up front, honey, corn syrup on toast, biscuits, light bit of floral, very dry bready finish.

Drinkability is a little above average as it would make a good, but not great hot weather beer. Overall a little better than I had expected it would be.","TinusTime","Apr 09, 2005"

I only picked this one up to review for another beer karma point and didn’t expect much from it. I’m cheerfully surprised. This is a light beer, but it has enough malt to give a rich taste, and enough hops to keep it lively and balanced. Can’t call it complex, and given all the extreme beers I’ve been drinking of late, this is a little brother by comparison, but this brother held his own.

It is the typical yellow color which is neither a plus or minus, there was little head and average carbonation. The smell was more malty than anything, with few distinctive tones.

Plenty of carbonation is noticeable early, works with the subtle malt to give a dry impression. Some sense of toasted biscuit mid mouth. Finishes softly, less carbonated (thankfully not fizzy -- the bane of drinkability), little aftertaste. A million miles from a "big beer" but there's a quaffability here.","ADR","Jan 05, 2003"

On the palate the flavor has a nice bitter-sweetness, slight citrus notes in there, light biscuity notes, and perfect bitterness and tingling feeling on the tongue from the hop zest. Body is medium and well carbonated. This is a very good Pilsener","WilliamPhilaPa","Jan 03, 2003"
3.5,1.7,3,3,3.5,4,4,"I approached this beer with something of a negative bias, based on a German friend who calls Bitburger a lowest-common-denominator beer, "the Budweiser of Germany." That being said, while not great, this is better than the bulk of mainstream US beers. Pours clear golden yellow with a finger's worth of dense, nearly white, foamy head. Hops are an evident element of the smell, accentuated by the neutral grain aromas I associate with pilseners. Hops are evident throughout, running dryer as the taste proceeds. While the texture is somewhat watery, the taste remains more substantial than I expected. Mouthfeel is quite clean, and the drinkability is as good as one normally finds in a pilsener. I would rather have a German wheat beer any day, but this isn't too darned bad.","BitteBier","Jan 03, 2003"
3.85,11.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a nice German beer. I like it better than Warstiener, which is Germany's Bud. It's a typical Pils, light in color with little to no head. It has a nice refreshing taste that's not too harsh on the buds, but at the same time, it's not too light that you think it's water. goes down smooth and finishes nice and easy.

Hops are present and perfectly accent the finish. This is an excellent example of a premium German pilsner/lager. I found a local store that sells this in tall cans and it is excellent.
