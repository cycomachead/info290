Sticky lacing clings in patches to the glass. Aroma is more assertive than typical pilsners with herbal and citrus hop notes underpinned by bready malt. Taste follows the nose - strong spicy, herbal bitterness with light bread and grainy malt sweetness.

Nose of lightly sweet malt, spicy and bittering hops, and some yeast notes with a light grain background.  Flavors are sweet malt backbone to the fore and back with spicy hops and bittering hops rounding it all together.  Very nice carbonation keeps it lively and high on the "session" scale of drinkability.  Lightly bitter aftertaste with some grain background.  Good if you like your pils with a bittering hop background.","Brutaltruth","Nov 09, 2014"

The aroma is distinct, with light bread notes, earthy and citrus hops. The taste is actually a little hop forward, dialing back the malt in favor of the two competing hops notes. The malt is more of a background note. It has a sharp crispness to it and some carbonation on the finish.","delta490","Oct 16, 2014"

4.1,1.7,,,,,,"Taste: Unlike Pilsner Urquell, it is a lot hoppier. Malt is about the same as PU, but the hops linger and eventually overpower the other flavors. Above average carbonation. About as light as you would expect from a Pislner, but it seems quirky because this level of hops is usually prominent in heavier beers.","UndatedSeapiece","Sep 06, 2014"

Still, if the goal is a clear, crisp, easy-drinker, this is off the mark.  The hops on the finish are just too strong.  In terms of enjoyment, I'd put Mama's Lil' Yella and Summerfest (both Czech) ahead of this.","SaltofOH","Sep 01, 2014"

I picked up Prima Pils for two reasons, honestly. First off, my pop is a huge fan of pilsners and lagers and this is one of the most praised (American) German pils around. And secondly, Victory is a local brewery that offers several beers that I adore, so I felt obligated to at least entertain their pilsner offering. I'm almost reluctant to admit that I love this beer. It's not one of my dearly beloved IPAs or stouts, but this beer, quite frankly, is effin' delicious. It's light, yet flavorful. It's top-tier, yet available. And given that summer is only midway through, you can bet this will be the beer of choice in my family BBQ coolers.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 19, 2014"

What I found here was a classic European pilsner done American style with a slightly amplified hop profile, though if I were to complain I'd say the malt profile was a bit lackluster. Still, you could do far worse if you're looking for a good American pilsner. This is the first brew I've reviewed from this brewery and I'm pretty impressed thus far.

It is however a SOLID offering from the always consistent Victory stable. I liken this to a consistancy of a Zwickel actually although it is not unfiltered is has a much more syrupy and hop forward flavor then a crisp and clear German Pils lager would. It is however highly sessionable and incredibly flavorful for a lager of its kind and I could put down a few of these easily on a warm day.","bushwik","Apr 01, 2014"

The taste is also hop-accented to the point that I cannot appreciate the malt body. I am not sure why dry hopping has invaded every beer style on the planet, since it was never intended for most of them. Prima pils is a solid American micro pilsener, but certainly not a "German Pilsner" as they say on their website. It is way too far out of balance. I taste great potential in this beer, but it lets me down in being just another blast of hops like a run of the mill west coast IPA.","felsenpils","Mar 25, 2014"

This is not unlike hoppier German pilseners from Germany, such as Jever, Waldhaus, Alpirsbacher, or Rothaus. Rothaus Pils (Tannenzäpfle) is one of my favorite all-time beers, so that this beer comes close is extremely exciting. A fantastic brew, and one I am planning on buying in greater quantities.

It reminds me very much of the European pilsners but without the skunkiness and corn flavors that you usually find in those. I bet much of that has to do with it being an American brew and can find it very fresh. I wish more places had this on tap so maybe Bud drinkers would give it a shot.","PaulyB83","Oct 04, 2013"
4.1,1.7,4,4,4.25,4,4,"The Victory Prima Pils is the perfect pilsner. It has a great full bodied pilsner taste with a load of hops to make this a dynamic taste experience. It poured a light golden color with a full creamy head. The first taste was reminiscent of many of the hoppy IPAs I have been having lately but there is enough of the signature German pilsner flavor to keep it well within the style. I had this on a hot afternoon and it was light enough to tame the heat and the dynamic hoppy bitterness kept me coming back for more. One of my favorite pilsners.","brurevu","Oct 02, 2013"

This beer is to Pilsner what IPA is to Pale ale. I didn't get enough balance of malt, in fact the hops kind of drowned out the flavors of the pilsner malts in this one. The final reason I didnt rate this beer higher was the ABV. Pilsner is a summer beer and I prefer a lower alcohol Pilsner.","Uniobrew31","Aug 12, 2013"

Not sure what we're looking at for IBUs, but the perceived bitterness is very high. This is easily the biggest, boldest pilsner I've come across (discounting some ridiculous 'imperial' pilsners). It's damn tasty, and the bite really wakes up the drinker, like in old movies when someone smacks a hysterical person in the face and yells "Snap out of it!" "Thanks, I needed that," would be my reply. Pairing options are interesting. Perhaps a fishy ceviche, or some herbal Mediterranean dishes. Spicy Italian sausage is a no-brainer.","ryan1788a5","Jul 28, 2013"

Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, floral, grass, cracker, pepper, light pine, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with a good balance of hops and fruity lager esters. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, apple, pear, pepper, pine, floral, grass, cracker, bread, hop earthiness, and floral spiciness. Good amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, pepper, grass, cracker, bread, hop earthiness, and floral spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; with a very hoppy flavor profile; and nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Pilsner style. Great hoppy flavor balance with good complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Feb 09, 2013"

The nose is very subtle, but it is very floral and nice.

Taste of pils malts, grains, biscuity, light and crisp, floral hops with a touch of citrus zest, fairly bitter and drying.

Slight german malt aroma. A bit of grain as well. Nice smell for a pilsner. Taste is very lemony at first with some subtle hoppiness...which immediately turns to a good amount of hoppiness. Grassy hops with some nice German malt flavor with crisp, earthy flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied and refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is very tasty for this style. Not my particularly favorite style, but this is one of my favorites when it comes to this genre.","DovaliHops","Aug 07, 2012"

Well done.","LIbeerguy","Jul 31, 2012"

4.15,3,4,4,4.25,4.5,4,"O - I like enough to make it part of my beer rotation. It's refreshing, has a lowish ABV but also has a lot of flavor, especially the bright lemon citrus and dry, spicy finish. Bolder than a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (another one in my regular rotation) but not quite as well balanced. I like this better than the Sierra Nevada Summerfest or the Stoudts Pils after tasting them side-by-side. Also, while this has a 1% higher ABV than my #1 session beer, 21st Amendment's Bitter American, as of late, this is capturing a bigger portion of my beer budget than in previous years. Really good stuff.","Tucquan","Apr 21, 2012"

The bitterness does give it some identity, but I don't think it would blend in with every other pilsner if it lacked it; its floral nature and accompanying sweetness are bewitching all by themselves. I'd give it a 4.5 on taste if it weren't for the overbitterness. So instead it's a 4. I'd give it a 4.5 overall if not for the bitterness, so instead it's a 4.

It's much more hop-forward with a crisp bitterness that almost steals the show, as compared to German or Czech styles. So fresh feeling. Lemon-like acidity and citrus combines terrifically with the crackery/grain/bread malt --malt is very delicate as compared to bready backbones in other styles. Drinkability is off the charts. This is my go-to "light beer", but it's never short on full flavor.","CheezyBlaster","Dec 28, 2011"

The hops are big and floral on the nose, with more malt in the mouth playing alongside the notes of fresh citrus. It is very smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation and low alcohol. I'd say there is a soft bitterness that is followed through the long finish and closes on a sweet hop taste.","shealoftus14","Dec 12, 2011"

3.76,-6.7,4,3,4,4,4,"Victory Pils available at the Boulevard in J'Town, PA. The beer's appearance is clear golden color with decent white head and carbonation which led to a good lace. The smell was typical of hay, barley and hint of hop. The flavor is dry strong presence of saaz hops. Mouthfeel is very good...there is enough flavor to keep the beer interesting and tasty.

Ignoring that aspect, the quality and flavor are top-notch and it is hard to think of a better variety that is on the market. The problem is that it appears to be one of several newer twists on the tradition of brews that originate in the Czech crown lands of Bohemia: it attempts to redefine pilsner by marrying it to something characterized by an abundance of hops.","JDM02370","Oct 09, 2011"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Definitely an enjoyable pilsener. If it was available at a similar price point to Noble Pils, I'd probably opt for it because of the bittering hops. Unfortunately, it's rather overpriced in Australia for what it is.","danieelol","Oct 09, 2011"

3.85,-4.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Victory Prima Pils: I usually stick with Colorado breweries. Given that I have Odell’s, Great Divide, Breckenridge, and New Belgium to choose from, just to name a few, I will be hard pressed to sample all of their offerings in any reasonable time period, but it will be fun! So it was a 12 pack of three different Victory beers on a good sale that tempted me to go outside of Colorado. The Prima Pils pours with a clear sunshine yellow body and white even head. The head lasts, but does not lace. The aroma lets you know that some bitter is coming, and it does. While there is an underlying carpet of sweet malt, it is piled high with a dry bitter flavor, from start to finish. I did like this beer; it goes down well and has a balance to it. Better with food than for sipping alone.","iSip","Sep 29, 2011"
4.26,5.7,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O: What a great pilsner! Now I know why it’s so esteemed by beer lovers. Victory has the right idea here – European flavor with a uniquely American element. This is my new favorite session beer.","BarryMFBurton","Sep 27, 2011"

3.46,-14.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, although this bottle was only about a week away from the end of its suggested 'best before" date, it still provided a bright yet earthy flavor profile that was a bit unexpected but quite nice. I'll have to keep my eye out for a fresher sample, though, to get the full effect of this renowned pilsener.","devilben02","Sep 20, 2011"

Sugars are well-balanced, and emphasize the grain flavors, rather than mask them.

(oops, guess I should have checked before I bought it, but I was in San Diego and just excited to see some stuff I can't get back home) Very floral hop aroma with just a touch of citrus and I am picking up just a touch a sulfurous aroma as well although not enough to be off putting. This is like a classic German Pilsner aroma, but beefed up a bit. Clean floral hoppiness on the palate with a decent malt backbone. Again I get just a touch of sulphur on the palate, maybe it wouldn't be there if the beer were fresher? Not sure. Anyway, I do like this beer quite a bit. Not exactly true to style, as others have said, but definitely a hop lover's pilsner.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 24, 2011"

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5," The tast is light toasted pils malt with a mild floral hop flavor and some spicy grassy tastes that aren't harsh, yet still gives the impression that this pils is highly hop flavored with a very mild yeast mineral quality and light pilsner malt sweetness. The finish is dry and spicy with a nice yeasty tinge. I think this is a great American take on the German Pils style, with a pretty hop forward taste, yet it is still within range to be considered traditional influenced with nice noble hop character and high drinkability.","Slatetank","Jul 20, 2011"

The taste, wow, I'm used to pilsners being real light, almost water like with some hop bite, but this is a full on hoppy pils, sort of like I remember SA Noble Pils being fresh, this is very good stuff. I get a tone of noble hops up front, a lemony, citrus taste, then on the way down some grassy, biscuity, sweet malts quickly followed by a load of bitter hops.

Not to be mistaken with the likes of a BMC lager, as this has a much cloudier and thicker appearance despite being such a light beer. Smell is of faint grassy hops, pretty muted for the most part. However, after checking the date on the bottle, this is a good bit past its prime. My fault for not checking the bottle. Oops. It holds up surprisingly well, the pleasant grassy hops are still there, just much more muted. I've had this fresh and it is a delight to drink on a hot day. Very refreshing. Just wish it was easier to find fresh around here. Victory bottles always seem to be a good bit past their prime. However, it's still very drinkable and I'm enjoying it. Definitely recommend this for the summer. Just don't be like me - check the date before buying.","atowle25","Jun 03, 2011"

Flavors of dry malt with a decent bit of grapefruit/citrus rind come into play, a slight earthiness/must is apparent as well. Light bubbly body, crisp/bitter/malty throughout with a dry lingering bitter finish. Easily one of my top three session beers: it’s bright and crisp. Overall, just a very satisfying brew that I drink regularly all year round. This coupled with a very fair price point makes it a hard beer to beat. Most definitely my favorite summer brew as well as my favorite pilsener. I don’t see what there is to not love about this beer.","Puddintane","May 06, 2011"

I have a hard time getting much nose, but I pick up carbonation, if that has a smell, banana and some spice. I think the Hop Devil has the same spicy note. Hops come through the taste with a bitterness that lingers. Banana notes as well. This is a light body beer that is easy to drink.

Big grassy, earthy hops greet the palate and come off cleanly, dry, and bitter. Wow, has a nice big green apple snap to it, something you only get from a fresh, hoppy pilsner. Jeez, you know I wonder how different the WORLD would be if people learned how to appreciate what a real pilsner style beer tastes like. Peace in the Mid-East? Maybe. Racial harmony? Possibly. Anyway, not quite as hard and bubbly mouthfeel as a "true" Czech pilsner, but slightly smoother.

A grassy/straw sweetness with a zesty hint of some dried mango and lemon peel. Crisp and bubbly with the first sip. A lot of lemony sweet light malt right after that tingle but then it breaks away into the hop flavors. A floral blast first that has a mild tropical fruitiness that switches quickly to a lemon dry bitterness. A grassy lemon dry bitterness.","DrinkingDrake","Apr 03, 2011"

Hints of banana flavored yeast and a nice finish that was full of fresh cut grass and a wet hay flavor. This was a nice medium bodied pilsner. Much thicker then you would normally see from the style, but it worked very well. An outstanding session ale, this was one I would have no issues in repeating any day. It was light, crisp and clean with a nice profile and low ABV, all things making this lean hard towards being very seasonable.","mikesgroove","Feb 26, 2011"

Personally, I'm not a hop-head but despite the strong hoppy bitterness I still found this beer to be incredibly drinkable. It's a very cool twist on an age-old style that I would recommend to fans of pale ale and traditional lager styles alike. Prima Pils is very well done.","weizenbob","Jan 23, 2011"

Biting herbal hops are beautifully meshed with semi-sweet malt. Dry finish brings back the hops again. Tantalizing carbonation and somewhat oily mouth-feel is very pleasant. This is a fine pilsner.

The hops come through the most in the smell though with a pretty pungent sharp, fruity, herbal note. The taste is fantastic with the pilsner cake malt taste in the beginning then the hops come in pretty sharp and adding some fruity overtones and then the malt comes in again to balance out some of the bitterness. The hops prevail though and leave you with a sharp dry bitterness. This is seriously hoppier then some IPA's I've had. This could almost pass for an IPA because of the dryness bitterness and the fact that they use a light malt to showcase the hops more. You can tell they use German hops instead of American. This and My Antonia from Dogfish Head are very similar but both are my favorite Pilsner beers to date.","thebrood1987","Nov 01, 2010"

The aroma is mild in nature, but hints at being a spicy lemon pepper flavor. The smell has a biscuit like smell almost combining into an aroma that is akin to lemon curd. The taste however is decidedly less exciting. It's a solid pilsener, but lack any depth whatsoever. It's still above average flavor, but not by much. There is a dry crisp lemon and grass flavor spiced with coriander. The saving grace of this beer is that while there is some bitterness to it it drinks really very smoothly and goes down nice and easy.

Flavor is, at first, distinctly hoppy (albeit light hops) and fresh. Later, notes of slight malt and some very light citrus flower develop. Very clean. Very light.

This is a very fine example of the pilsner style. Smell of Pilsner hops are prevalent with grass and some scent of lemon. Taste is grassy hops and lemon. Mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and refreshing with some carbonation and a slight malt finish, thanx again Victory for the German malt.

3.92,-2.7,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Notes: I have a lot to say about this beer. First of all, it should be enjoyed cold, like right out of the fridge at 37º. The reason for this is it can't be enjoyed fast enough to prevent that unpleasant sensation that your drink is too warm. Second, I like Sam Adams Noble Pils much better. Finally, it just doesn't have anything going for it. It's a Pilsener with more of a hop taste than a strong malt profile, and as such I just can't recommend it over most of the ales I've enjoyed. Just wished there was more to it, something to further separate it from the mass-produced BMC products that boast "Pilsener taste." If this is how a pilsener is supposed to taste, then I'm not sure it's my favorite style. Was pretty hyped about this one, too...oh well.","EbPhrygian","May 12, 2010"

Clear yellow body. Lots of carbonation. Moderate sized white head. Smell didn't grab me at all. Taste on the other hand was excellent. Wonderful and light, it has all the flavor that a well-built pils should exhibit. Just a hint of malt and hops; it's the crispness that stands out. It's a lager, so it may lack a bit in my mind in the mouthfeel category, but that only makes the drinkability that much better. Low abv also makes this beer extremely easy to quaff.

Aroma is of sweet grainy malt, straw and, zesty hop aromas. Taste is even more zesty with wonderful lemony citrus, herbal and grassy hop notes. The beer has a firm bitterness that makes it nicely thirst quenching, though not as smooth as some other examples. The malt is definitely there, but is light and subdued. This pilsener is definitely showcasing the hops, but at the same time it is quite balanced.

Just like the smell there is a nice flavor combination that makes this a very drinkable session beer. Overall a nice easy drinking beer that takes little trouble to polish off a six pack.

Prima Pils was far to carbonated, its carbonation was that of Busch Light which does not boast flavor only drinkability. For the style it has too much hops. To me it tasted very similar to Summit Pisener where you can get 12 for this price. All in all not that bad but why people rate it so high for this style??

Taste is very tangy up front from the lemon influence, balanced out perfectly with a grainy, biscuity flavoring, and finish lends to a mild pale malt flavoring. Light body, high carbonation, goes down easily, crisp body, clean finish and bitter aftertaste.

At the risk of being branded a heretic, let me just say right now that I'm not really in the camp of the hopheads. I prefer a nice balance in most styles, so bear that in mind as you read on. Taste also is dominated by hops, to me, almost to the point of distraction. Hop fans will probably enjoy this, but it left me wishing for a stronger malt presence to even things out. That said, this beer showed classic hops spiciness/bitterness that some others would probably quite enjoy. Good, smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation for a decent level of drinkability. While I certainly didn't dislike this beer, IMHO, it lacks the balance to be a top representative of the style, in fact, reminding me somewhat of an IPA> That said, those with more of a fondness for hops would probably enjoy this beer immensely, and I think this conclusion is certainly borne out by several other reviewers.","bristol2120","Oct 04, 2009"

Smell is almost kind of grassy, don't know what else to say as I can pick up some other smells but nothing really sticks out. Taste has a bit of a lemon or zesty hint. Like the smell I'm not completely sure what else is there. It's not really bitter but it isn't too sweet either. Goes down pretty easily though. I've only had a few Pillseners before and I think it really isn't my style. I can drink it though I just don't dig it. I'm not going to rate it down because of it though.

There's a huge hop aroma out of the pour. Fresh cut grass and a bit perfumey. It's really clean on the nose. Flavors are the same. This is a really straightforward and delicious pils. Fresh cut grass, and a grainy characteristic from the malt. No steel or skunked flavors, which is nice! Crisp and medium body. I appreciate not drinking a watery pils. There's some bready malt, honey, and even lemon citrus. I'd have many of these in one sitting.","washburnkid","Aug 31, 2009"

The aroma is fresh grain and strong, sharp, spicy hops. It smells like a wet barley field with a strong whiff of lemon peel shavings and apple slices. The flavor is fairly hoppy for the style, but there's a wonderful malt presence. It's a thirst-quenching beer that doesn't cut corners. The flavors are strong and crisp. This beer doesn't quite measure up to Moonlight's Reality Czech, but I'd bet the contest would be extremely close if I was working with fresh kegs of each.

Smell is a little skunky, proabably not the best descriptor because the beer was not skunky. I can see why people use this as a good example of a pilsner, but I did not enjoy it.

The difference is in the aroma, though. As the head settles into a medium-heavy collar, an aroma like that of no other fizzy pale lager arises from the glass. Wait, that smells like hops! It IS hops, an abundance of 'em!! Citrusy (lemon) hops to be exact. Saaz? I think so. Ist sip has an initial hint of malt sweetness followed by those citrusy, slightly metallic hops. It's a bold, powerful flavor that gets more intense on the swallow & lasts long after. There is active carbonation on the tongue and a medium-light, crisp finish. So THIS is what all those BMC pilsner wanna be imposters are supposed to taste like, huh? Man, the difference is like night & day!! Drinkable? Hell yeah...all day & well into the night!!

I did have to shell out about $12 for a six-pack, though, which strikes me as somewhat ridiculous. Six bottles of Lagunitas Pils can be had for less than $10, and are at least as enjoyable. For me, a drinkable lager should not break the bank. I'm on the opposite coast from Victory, however, which may have something to do with the increased cost.

Copious tiny bubbles present in solution and effervescing to the underside of the cap. Delicate strands of lacing were revealed as the head receded; good retention. Clarity was translucent. Nose was very subdued; perhaps some grains and a hint of citrus. Taste is predominantly cereal grains, but I get a bit of skunk in the mix, as well as a kiss of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel was light-bodied, effervescent and a little prickly across the middle of the tongue. Pilseners are pretty hit or miss for me, and this is a bit of a miss.

The taste is almost all hops from the start to the finish. It starts off with some sweet malt and spicy hops that give way to some bitter grapefruit rind hops in the finish.

Occasional citrus evident, and slight lemon and bready malts noticeable, but kind of unbalanced with hops dominating.

The smell, a spicy hop combo of grassiness and lemon zest, is sharp and enticing. Upfront, I taste the same flavors as well as some grapefruit, while a small, sweet backbone just appears in the otherwise quite bitter finish.

Carbonation has a lively presence. The smell is earthy, citrus hops before a light malt makes its presence known. An herbal undertone is detected as well. The taste is primarily pure herbal hops with a pronounced malt taste. Earthy and citrus tones present themselves as well to add to an excellent balance of flavors. The finish is dry and lingers with a hops bitterness mixed perfectly with a hidden sweetness. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with a medium body. This is what it seems like the macro posers would be aspiring to. Absolutely drinkable.

4.45,10.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Out of a bottle this classic German styled beer was a hazy golden color with a little bit of rising carbonation. The one finger white head retained nicely as a cap and left streaks of lacing. The aroma was very appealing, lightly spicy hops, big floral hops, biscuity malt and generally a semi-sweet character. The flavors were very fresh and 'bright.' It started with big floral hops, then went to dry biscuity malt and some sweet malt, light spices (cloves?), lemongrass and a bitter, crisp finish. Pleasantly sweet but not in a heavy-handed way. Marvelously complex for a generally boring style and excellently balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation medium/soft and the body medium. I have no problem say that this is the best Pilsner I have ever to date had (02/21/09), it would be an amazing summer beer and you have to check it out.

The change of pace from the dark ales is refreshing now and then. And what a pleasant surprise this one is. Beautiful bright yellow (slightly cloudy) in the glass with a rich body and decent head that disappeared quickly but laced a bit all the way down. Subtle carbonation visible. Smell was a hint of malt with a nice fruity/floral hops scent, something that continued with the first sips. Rich mouthfeel and malty body with a refreshing fruity (as opposed to piney or spicy) hops flavor behind it. No "mystery" tastes (as with some craft-brewed "German Pilsners"). Tart, dry finish that leaves you smacking your lips for more. Something you could down quite regularly (and frequently) and never grow tired of.

Really earthy, mineral type notes in the smell as well. The hops dominate the palate at first taste as well, but start to share the stage with the mineral and earth tastes as you continue taking sips. This one really grew on me, it has to be one of my favorite renditions on a pilsner. Typically a pilsner is going to struggle to get and hold my attention, but Victory did the job.

Smell is sort of spicy with some European hops smell. Taste is of a lot of Saaz hops to me (not sure if they were actually used), very European taste to it... but also a little hoppier (I'm guessing it was Americanized?).

Sometimes hops are over done and IMO this is one of those instances. Finish was almost metal tasting. Beer was light and well carbonated. Not my favorite beer.

I'm not a big lager drinker, esepcially nto pilsners. This smells like a somewhat refined version of Heineken. More going on with the taste, though I am afraid not in a great way. Some nutty and tartness, but also a real medicinal feel. A good amount of residual biterness for the style, though lacking any definable hop-like citric, floral or earthy flavors. Light, effervescent, watery on the mouth. Very dry. For me, maybe the problem is the style. This is probably a great pilsner, given the ratings, but not for me. The flavor profile is very limited, and the bitter dryness, without any real hop or malt burst just gives the beer an unbalanced and unappetizing feel. I won't be back.","TheDoorman","Feb 03, 2009"
4.8,19.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: With the balance of mildly sweet malt, its mild hop bitterness, and its overall freshness of taste I could drink several of these. I keep wanting another taste and find this Pils fresh and refreshing any time of year. Note: I find this one a bit temperature critical in the sense that consumed too cold the hop bitterness is strong. As the beer warms a bit the balance becomes better and it is hard to tell if you are tasting malt or hop or both.","drtth","Feb 01, 2009"

I definitely prefer a little less bitterness, a little more balance, and more flavour. That said, it is very, very clean, somewhat tasty, interesting, and different.

A light bread and biscuit flavor starts out the taste. It then blends to a grassy and mild citrus bitterness, that lingers on the palate for some time. A watery thin feel at the front, it then gradually gains weight as it reaches the back of the palate. The scrubbing sensation of carbonation finishes it all out at the end.

4.2,4.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass.Appearance is a transparent golden straw yellow with a thick two fingers of bone white fizzy head that slowly fell back to moderate lacing. Active carbonation slowly builds up a light cap of white foam. Aroma is classic pilsener, crisp and clean with that skunky hoppiness and maltly earthen undertones. Hop profile is more pronounced in the aroma than most of this style. Taste is more of the same, crisp and refreshing, grassy/floral hops, malt and wheat. Finishes dry and smooth, nice light skunky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little rough, but expected with a lighter bodied brew with moderate to high levels of carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding, clean and refreshing beer with great flavor, excellent session beer. Highly recommend, will seek out again.","danielocean03","Sep 06, 2008"

Aroma of big grassy hops, a bit of lemon rind, and husky pale malts. Flavor wave of bitter, grassy, spicy hops, backed up by a crisp, dry dose of pale malt. Slightly herbal in the hop flavor, slightly grainy and cereal like in the malt profile. Bone dry on the finish, refreshing, smooth, full-bodied. A wonderful example of a Czech-inspired, American Pilsener.","KeefD","Sep 01, 2008"

Nose is crisp with yeasty wheat and a lite hop profile. With first sip you get a clean fresh balance of hops and wheat. Very crisp and refreshing while carrying a balance of hop bitterness and yeasty sweetness. Smooth drinking. Carries a mouthfeel that is slightly thick and really invites the next sip. Super drinkable.","SPLITGRIN","Aug 31, 2008"

Anyway, I saw the reviews on here, and thought I should get over my view of pilsners and try this one out. I am damn glad that I did! Poured from the bottled into a DAB mug (running out of clean glasses). Pours a hazy yellow color with a good head that remains about 1/8" thick throughout the beer. Smell is grassy, natural, and with German malt. Taste is much more complex than any pilsner I have had to date. Sweet - honey maybe?, grassy, malty, and finishes slightly bitter. This would make a fantastic session brew, and it might have to be a standard beer in my fridge.","jdubjacket","Aug 23, 2008"

4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a bright gold with a big foamy white head that holds for a little bit but fades leaving a thin film the whole way down and lacing some. The smell is a nice mixture of barley malts and agressive hops. The taste is very similar to the smell with the hops coming out more as the beer warms. The beer has a good body and carbonation.

Poured a very pale golden yellow with an enormous white pillowey head that left some impressive lacing down my glass. Clean mouthfeel that is wonderfully smooth which teams with the flavor to make this beer incredibly drinkable. Flavor falls right in line with a nice crisp and snappy profile. The hops (I believe saaz are commonly used) round out a lightly malted base creating a nicely balanced flavor. There is a beautiful easiness to this pilsner ( I don't want to call it simple ) which is what makes it so very good and easily enjoyable. Not my favorite style and for the price I will likely not re-visit this too often.","kinger","Aug 05, 2008"

The nose is very impressive and surprisingly large, lots of big fruit esters and (Belgian?) yeast. A metallic note surfaces as the beer settles. The big fruity/grassy character of the nose really transfers into its flavor, over all balanced, decent pale malt backbone and a dry hop profile, it sports a rather bitter but not offensive aftertaste. Spicy and farmhouse funky, this reminds me of a 'light' saison rather than a true pils. Light/medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation on the tongue. Its fairly drinkable, and would be great in the hot months.","ATPete","Jul 24, 2008"

I guarantee you won't be disappointed.","Generik420","Jul 22, 2008"

A medium-bodied beer which holds well since this beer is all about the hops. Has that dry, crispy sensation with a bitter backbite but goes down smooth and tasty the whole time.

A heavier mouthfeel than your average pilsner, with none of the "watery" body that plagues some pilsners.

Not the best Victory has to offer, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better pilsner.

I poured this beer into a pilsner glass it poured a beautiful golden color that left a thin white head on top. The body is clear, clean, and left only carbonated bubbles in the glass. The aroma is straw, hay, grass, earthy rustic peppery hops that really make this pilsner enjoyable. The taste is crisp, refreshing, balanced bitter bite with a lemon and honey fruitiness to the beer. I love lagers and due to the main offerings available here in the united states they get a bad wrap but this one helps debunk the myth that all lagers are flavorless, watery, beers.

The head is modest but holds throughout with good lacing, very solid head. The aroma is pretty faint, just a bit of mild hops perhaps, not sure. The flavor is also very mild, not as definitive as say an Urquel or other European favorites. More of a wheat quality to the taste, a suggestion of lemon. No skunkiness here. Fairly light and crispy with a slightly creamy feel that delivers the flavor. Clearly a quality brew but I would prefer a little more flavor in this recipe to fully deliver.

The beer came out pale, pale yellow with a small head that lasted the whole time, though it left no noticeable lacing. Mild is the best way to describe the smell, with light malt and grassy hops. It felt just like a pilsner, at least my idea of one, should feel, with prickling carbonation and refreshing crispness. All four of these from the 12-pack went down easily on a sweaty day, and in not much time. Prima is as classy as a pils gets.","robrobrob","Jul 05, 2007"

No lace here to speak of. Smells clean and malty, like a proper German pilsner should, right? Right. You can tell just from smelling this puppy that you're not getting another macro-processed American pilsner-style lager. No corn in this guy. The malt is the dominant aroma here, but there are faint notes of cut grass and old shoe leather as well. Not much fruit that I can sense, although at times there are also faint lemony scents as well. The taste is malty goodness as well, but with a very pleasant hop kick in the finish. Very well balanced, with some subtle buttery flavor as well. And that mouthfeel? Smooth. Almost chewy, but clean and crisp all at the same time. A heckuva a pils for this side of the pond, no doubt.

Lemon and citric hop notes are the most obvious aromas, with a light Pilsener malt backing and mild floral hop tones. The first sip is full of pale malt sweetness and sharp pilsener malt. Exhibits a clean lager profile, free from any noticeable off-flavors or yeast by-products. Aftertaste is struck with lemon/orange flavored alpha oils and a background floral Hallertau taste. Solid bitterness is balancing but not aggressive. Med-light mouthfeel with a gentle but crisp carbonation that allows a refreshing and effervescent mouthfeel, yet does not drown out the subtle malt and hop character with too much fizz.

The taste was clean and refreshing with citrus and herbal hops, a dash of pepper, a dab of dried grapefruit, and just the slightest hint of toasted malts in the background. The mouthfeel was light and not too dry with a mild aftertaste bite of dried citrus fruits and herbal hops. Another winner from Victory Brewing. This could definitely make an excellent choice for a summer session beer or any season for that matter. I should also say thanks to fellow BA HoboAGoGo for pointing out this beer to me. I could see why this is one of HoboAGoGo's favorite F-ing beers!","AltBock","Mar 19, 2007"
4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a light straw color, wonderful fluffy white head, with lots of fast carbonation bubbles rising to the head. Smell was crisp and clean, hints of citric tartness, and clean linens. Taste is great, very crisp and clean with a healthy dose of sharp hops. The hops have a distinct bitterness to them, almost sour, and very delicious and refreshing. Also to be found are some hints of grain, pleasantly and mildy malted, as well as some peppery spice in there. Overall, an amazing pils that is highly drinkable/sessionable, something to keep in the fridge at all times.","lehows","Mar 16, 2007"

The medium high carbonation allows some smoothness in the mouthfeel and follows with some cloying. Bitterness is right up front with its sharp hop profile and ends dry with a peppery hotness. Grainy, grassy, corn sugar sweetness rounds this out and just a little musty earthiness brings the flavors together. The finish starts dry, chalky, and peppery and then a sweet hoppy floral character comes into play.","cabsandking","Mar 08, 2007"

Nice graininess underneath. On the palate, rough hops are at the forefront -- not rough like a bronco, but rough like fine-grained sandpaper. Light barley malt backing on the palate, which provides some smoothness to the beer without being overly creamy or thick. Mouthfeel is light in weight but scratchy with hops. Overall, this is a wonderful pils -- it's got all the hallmarks of the style, but it's also got an American edge in that it's drier and hoppier than most Euro examples.

There's also a slight hop bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light, but crisp and refreshing. It would be better for a hot summer day, but it's still good on a colder day.

Smells of pils malt, gentle and elegant, some piny, but subdued hops, pale malts and a hint of honey (like mentioned in other reviews). The taste is crisp and refreshing, a very quenchable beer, I feel as though I enjoy it more the bigger the mouthful I drink. The pils malt is present, with subtle bitterness from the hops. To make an oxymoron this beer screams of subtlety. The quality of the water is even present to a degree, as far as my limited experience with pils this is very nice.

Crisp, clean hop flavor is most immediate on the pallate, followed by bitter malt in equal measure. No one flavor outshines the other. It's just smooth. Mouthfeel was unremarkable, which is as much as can be expected of any pilsener. Overall it's a first rate brew, one of Victory's best, if not their best. A highly drinkable beer.

The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and crisp. Spicey Saaz hops are noticeable right away in the taste. Flavor's a little non-descript upfront, but the assertive hoppiness of the Saaz comes through soon enough. Flavors of grapefruit are also present in the hoppy pils. Without the assertive use of hops I think this would be a rather regular and bland pilsner. Nice maltiness toward the back. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish. I had this with Italian sausages and pasta and it paired wonderfully. Definitely one to seek out and give a try.","Winter","Jul 29, 2006"

Hops at first, but a little less hoppy than the aroma indicated. Tastes rather hoppy, but in a spicy way--good hop choice. As for the malt/yeast aspect, it's middle of the road--not stale but not quite bready, though malt flavors have improved since the last time I tried it. Clean overall. No alcohol noticable. Mouthfeel is actually too high in carbonation for me, light but not watery. With a heavy pour, the flavors are more balanced. Mind you, it's a pils. Drinkability is rather good, and this is a truly good pils, which are hard to come by. Far better than Brooklyn (at least in the bottle), but still not quite as pleasing as my local microbrew pils (New England Elm City Lager). A big, widely available winner of a pale crafted lager.","Liquids","Jul 17, 2006"

Mouthfeel is also excelent, somewhat dry, lacking the "slick" feeling I get from lots of pilsners, and with a perfect medium-high carbonation.

It's clean and refreshing, though I'd like a bit more carbonation. Exp date of June 28th, 06.... I feel this is a much better brew when fresh. Bitterness doesn't come in any more so than an Urquell, but it is appropriate. Overall, a bit of a dissapointment, I anticipated something more enlightening by the previous reviews.

In reality, this is about as good as a pilner gets. Though no amped up body, hops, or foreign character, it's simple and to-the-point. A nice pilner malt base with characterful hops (may not be classic noble versions) and maybe an American hop or two for a better citrus and acidic hop finish. Lightly earthy and dusty, and a body that is on the upper end of the style scale. Although many will proclaim the Pilsners should not contain esters of any sort, I find that a pleasant, light estery quality of pears and a nectar-like perfume aroma compliment the beer well. Because of esters and basically no dms or acetaldahyde, the beer may use ale yeast? Finsihes very clean and very crisp. No doubt a best-of-style beer!","BEERchitect","Jun 17, 2006"

The taste is light and dry, with a more prominent hop taste than most Pilsners, and I feel like a touch of American hops, although the bottle says no. Overall quite a good pilsner; a little more bitter than I'd like, but it's a clean bitterness that doesn't really compromise the drinkability.

I'm picking up a citrus smell, lemon? An absolutely great choice for the summer season. I could pair this with just about anything off of the grill. I am by nature a lover of strong Belgian browns.

This is what a pilsener smells like at its best. The taste begins with floral notes than moves towards grass and spices. The finish is a nice clean bitterness that envelops my whole tongue. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. Although this is still a light beer, it is probably the heaviest pilsener I have yet tasted, and I do think that the extra weight really helps the mouthfeel. Whereas most pilseners can be discribed as crisp and light, Prima Pils can be discibed as crisp and smooth. Overall, this is a great pilsener and will hold a rotating spot in my refrigerator.","KarlHungus","Apr 14, 2006"

Awesome stringing of tiny bubbles. The smell is not the most impressive to me, sweet yet simple hops. Clean. This has some nice yet very light and sharp hop flavor. Tastier than most pilsners i have had by far, but it certainly tastes very euro. This is drinkable. but i would take Brooklyn's Pilsener over this any day. It tastes similar to ass macro pilseners, its just that you can tell more time and better ingredients into it because there are no disgusting chemical aftertastes.

3.43,-14.9,3.5,3,4,3,3,"Overall Impression: A quality pilsner. In the style of Urquell but with a bit more assertive hop presence. For all the bitter, it doesnt pucker. I think the carbonation is a touch high and the transparent appearance kind of throws me a bit, but a quality beer none the less. I cant see this being a session beer; its scratching my beer itch pretty quickly.","HardTarget","Oct 26, 2005"
4.22,4.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"You'll know if you'll like it before you taste it. The smell is that strong and distinct. Grainy flavors. A hops smack stonger and sharper than just about any pils you've tried. Some subtle hints of sweet and tart fruit. This is highly drinkable in the sense that you'll want to have more, not in the bogus sense that it's so, ahem, bland that it doesn't put up any fight going down. This beer is soft and light on the palate, but it's also interesting and for real for real. Probably my favorite Pils. If you have macro-swilling friends, this might be a good crossover beer to shove down their naive palates, or it might just be more than they can handle.","GnomeKing","Oct 24, 2005"
4.35,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear light straw with a big thick white head and excellent lacing. Smell is herbal hops and grassy with some lemon notes. Tastes very hoppy, mostly herbal but with some spiciness. However there is also enough bready malt to provide some balance. This beer has a very nice clean but substantial mouthfeel. Very nicely carbonated with a dry finish. Very drinkable. Overall- awesome pils. Easily the best I've had of the style.","burnstar","Oct 22, 2005"

Crisp aroma with spicy saaz, fresh floral hops, and a bit of lemon sitting on top of light pils malt sweetness. Malty sweetness just balances out contributions from the hops. There's an oily hop bitterness that's quite forward and carries through the finish. Hop flavour is citric and floral with just a hint of spiciness that kicks in towards the end. Light body with moderately high carbonation, but this beer doesn't come close to feeling watery. The texture is a bit slick and there's just a little residual sweetness that keeps the finish from drying out too much. This is a very refreshing beer packed with hops. Definitely my kind of pilsner.","DrJay","Oct 13, 2005"

Looks like the proverbial "Beer" you see in cartoons and on TV. Aromas of hops, malt and sweet earthiness fills the nose. Very nice. Taste is delectible; hops, malt, sweet spices, citrus and floral notes fill the palate, all the while remaining smooth and crips. Light mouthfeel is refreshing and smooth. A high level of drinkability is found here, as this brew could easily be a session beer or a cross over point for many macro drinkers to see the light of day in a craft brew world. Highly recommended.","Frozensoul327","Sep 27, 2005"

Mouthfeel is zippy yet smooth, and finished with a slight astringency, making this one very easy to drink. The aroma is very soft with a traditional Saaz nose, freshly mown hay, and delicate pale malts. The taste is initially floral and spicy with Saaz, followed by a subtle grainy pale malt body, nicely balanced with a moderate bitterness.

I realize that they are supposed to be a bit hoppy but its just a too much for me. Upon a second sip I detect some citrus and grassy flavors. A excellent example of the pilsner style, but just a bit too hoppy in my opinion. Still a quality and tasty beer though.","sabrills70","Jul 29, 2005"

A banquet of spicy of floral hops hit the nose with a bready malt in the background. The taste is absolutly delicious! Spiced with hops to perfection. Pine like bitterness hits the tounge first and then evens out to a softer floral flavor. It's like the hops are in a tuga-war with the malts because the malts are trying to keep the hops in check. Dry hoppy finish. Smooth medium body and perfect drinkabilty. Damn this is good drinking. I love a great pilsner during the summer time, but this one threw me off guard.

The head fell quickly, but settled leaving about a 3/8" cap that lasted through the whole glass. The brew had a light straw color and a clarity that could only be attained through filtration. A hefty amount of Saaz was detected in the nose, likely from dry hopping, and this German Pilsner also had a liberal amount of hops in the taste.

The middle is predominently malt sweet with honey qualities...perhaps a hint of caramel. The ending is another hoppy burst. A bit more floral, but still with the metallic quality.

4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a light golden color with a large foamy egg white head. Head recedes to a small layer above the liquid. Not really any lacing, only a few bubbles rise to the top. Smell is slightly hoppy but more grassy but in a good way. Taste has much more of a hop precense than the aroma. I guess I might be used to the whole dry hopping thing but this doesn't really seem dry hopped. Quite a full body which takes the main stage with a nice herbal element. Hops are nicely noticeable but not stinging in any way. The spicyness of the hops work with the rest of the flavors in near perfect harmony. They just work with the rest of the beer beautifully. Finish has little acidity and lingers with a hop bite. Great beer here, probably the best pils I have ever had. I need to get me some pilsners from Germany and compare but this is damn excellent.","granger10","May 29, 2005"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Pours a nice light golden colour, sparkly with a small head that quickly dissipates. Smells like sweet malt, with a little bit of up front hop bitterness. It's tasty, sweet at the front, pretty full and malty, and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Pretty full for a pilsner, lots of flavour and very enjoyable, probably one of the best pilsners out there. Definately a fine session beer.","Viggo","May 26, 2005"

4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Light gold in color with a medium amount of carbonation. The smell is fairly malty, with a good dose of floral hops. The malt flavor in this one is quite unique, taking on some wildflower honey type qualities. The hop flavors are both grassy and floral, and contribute a bracing bitterness to the mix. I'd drink this regularly if it were available locally, and it's inspired me to homebrew a clone of it sometime in the near future.","fisherman34","May 18, 2005"

The smell is big, juicy hops with a spicy background, seems like saaz hops and there is a light malt scent in the background. The taste is also dominated by hops, you get a resiny hop oil flavor as well as a citrusy tartness to it. The saaz hops really make themselves felt with a spicy middle followed by a biscuity malt flavor to balance the finish. The finish is dry and refreshing.

The head receded quickly, and left a dapple of lace on the side of the glass. I could smell the hops (Saaz?) from 3 ft away. They really dominate the aroma with a crisp citrus character. No malt really comes through in the nose. The taste is a light crisp hop-forward flavor that again has the citrus, a subtle grapefruit character that has an almost earthy tone. This delivers an assertive bitterness to the beer. The malt is completely overcome by the hops. This is not a bad character. Very crisp and refreshing mouth feel. Highly drinkable. What a great summertime beer. Pilsners have not been my favorite beer for several years, but this could change my mind.","carln26","Apr 28, 2005"

Some grass is noted, as well as citrous hops. Hops immediately bite your tongue and don't let go. Bitter lemon transitions into some interesting spiciness. Bready malt attempts to balance the bold hops. Finish is spicy with some herbal qualities, backed by malty smoothness with some grassiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean and finishes quite dryly. Light and refreshing, drinkability is quite high for this one (especially with the approaching warm weather). I was expecting this to be hoppy, but it exceeded my expectations. I've never had a beer this light that was as aggressively hopped. Quite interesting, and very tasty.","BeerFink","Apr 26, 2005"

Nose is delicate but definite, malt and grassy hops. Grain/malts start out, quickly overcome by pleasant citrus and bitter hops that back off but leave a dry finish.

Sugary sweet grapefruits hit your palete on the finish along with some slightly bitter hops. Overall, this is pretty smooth and silky with some tingly carbonation throughout.

Grassy, floral, spice are all there in the finish. The beer does stay in some what of a balance however and never goes over the top in terms of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is nice with good carbonation which helps enable a crisp clean mouthfeel. Never does the hoppiness feel heavy. Drinkability is good.

The nose is divine. There is just a hint of lager scent in there, but there is also a really big noble hop presence along with a somewhat grassey malt. I like it. The flavor is also very nice, with a very crisp and clean spicey noble hop that hits first and fades to a really refreshing hop flavor, not bitterness. The malts provide just a slightly sweet background. Wow. So good. The feel is thin to moderate with a lively carbonation.

I love the Hallertau hops and this is a little over the top for the average joe six pack drinker. But just right for me as I love hops.

I've recently been more into the not so intense beers meaning less stouts, porters, and double IPAs and more ESBs, lagers, and pilsners. Don't know why, it's just a phase I'm going through. Definately a little dissapointed by this beer though. There's nothing particularly bad about this beer at all, and there's nothing particularly good either. Pours a very light and bubbly clear yellow color, almost like a sparkling cider or champagne or something. Smell is vague but I can detect some spicyness and a light malt flavor. Taste is just a dud. Nothing bad, nothing good. I don't see the hop characteristics in this beer, as many have noted. Just some spicy characters and some bready biscuity malts, but nothing special. I've liked every other Victory brew I've tried, but this one falls short. Unless you're in the mood for a really plain beer, skip this one.","twelvsies","Jan 17, 2005"

Very good pilsner taste profile, with a solid sweet malt introduction, followed by a significant flowery hops presence, ever so smooth yet delivering just the right bitter bite demanded by the style. The malt fades first, leaving a good bitter sensation at the back of the throat as the liquid disappears. The bite intensifies in the aftertaste, just as it should.

The malt flavors peak their heads around the corner of this brew before the hops pummel your tongue with a drying finish.

Beer is canary yellow in color with shimmering highlights and exceptional clarity. Full aroma of lemony hops even at fridge temperature; a little warmth brings out a compact, leafy bouquet of lemon rind and wet grass clippings balanced by a slight puffed rice maltiness; finishes with some uric salinity. Lemon and hay flavors fill out the midpalate, with a strong bitterness--but not strong enough to overwhelm hints of starfruit and corn silk. Extremely persistent aftertaste suggests quinine and citric rind. Mouthfeel is light, wet, and very firm. I would rather have this as an apertif than drink it in session.

The taste is perfect, a nice light grain and toast upfront followed by a great but not overly powerful floral hop, a hint of lemon tingle to the hop as well, light bodied and a very good session beer.

A bit dry and bitter in the finish which just adds to its drinkability because it demands that one's palate should have another sip. This is not only the finest US-brewed pilsener I've experienced, it competes with its German and Czech counterparts quite nicely. This beer rocks. It is so balanced in all the right places.

The nose was quite lively, consisting of a robustly aromatic orange tinged hop bouquet and a subtle yeastiness. The taste was refreshing, crisp, and bold. The firm bready grassy dry malt base was accented with bitter orange-lemon notes. It finished with a zippy dry orange peel bitterness, with very nice lingering qualities. The body was appropriately firm and carbonated to match the flavor profile. Conclusion: An excellent, nicely hopped pilsner that should please those who normally drink bigger/full-flavored beers.

The aroma is a bit malty-er than a standard pils -- but it still hit my nose with that wet grassy smell that I'm not overly fond of. It had a nice, but not big, mouthfeel, and a slightly sweet taste, mildly carbonated, with little or no aftertaste. For me, this is one of the better of this style -- just not my thing.

The smell is where you'll learn what this beer is winding up to throw at you. Spicy hops abound in smell and taste. The sharpness cuts through the smooth malt and prickles the tounge. Other herbal flavors run through, as if you just took a sickle to a field of flowers and grasses. The hop blend really is unique, and it stays on the tounge long after. I feel this is the point of contention among reviews. Some like that. Some don't. IMHO I like, or at least don't mind, hops sticking on the palette. This is really an exceptional brew, unlike anything I've had. May sound crazy, but I feel my sinuses clearing. It's not insanely hoppy though. I'd be curious if anyone knows the IBU of it.

Very light feel to it even though I would hardly describe this as a very light-bodied beer. Unexpectedly smooth from the first sip to the last. Malt sweetness is mild and is wiped aside quickly by a snappy hop bite that offers a really earthy, weedy, plant bitterness. Finishes, of course, pretty dry. Went down in a heartbeat. I was a little surprised, frankly. I was really expecting the hops to be overwhelming, and while they do dominate every aspect of this brew, I think they form much more "accessible" type of experience than many super-hopped brews out there.

This poured a beautiful clear gold, which I haven't seen in a quite a while (since drinking Foster's over the summer). A medium head about 1/2 inch settled and disapated quickly to a thin lace which stuck to the glass through the entire pint. The smell was full and floral with hoppy overtones. It smelled like what I used to call "beer" --- just better. The taste was full and light at the same time. A very crisp, not-to-bitter tingle with a nice balance of malt and hops which mellowed out on the tail end. There was a very slightly sweet taste but definitely not fruity at all. The carbonation added some "lift" to the glass and this was extremely drinkable. Victory is just amazing.... Hop Devil (my current fave, Storm King....)

I would recommend this pils to hop addicts for sure. But for me, there is never a joyful balance of malt and hops.

And I don't want to say it's a great beer just because it has a lot of hops, but I do want to say it's a great beer because it has a lot of interest throughout, with a respectable malt base supporting a wonderfully captivating blend of hop flavors that lasts from the nose to the finish, all while still having the very dry spicy finish I'd expect from a pils... only with a nice addition of extra dimension.","Stopper","Oct 09, 2003"
4.4,9.2,4,4,4.5,4,5,"This is a pilsener? Wow - a whole new world of what a pils can be has opened before my eyes. Massive carbonation - took three pours to let the head settle and get the beer in the glass. Candy sweet aroma, but the beer was not sweet in flavor. Hops - this beer is an example of how a pils can be hoppy, and done darn well, at that. As a hop-head, I have great appreciation for a lager that can carry a substantial hop load without an ale's malt to shoulder the burden. Very crisp and clean, and, surprisingly, very little hop bitterness at the finish. If I had regular access to this beer, it would be a staple in the garage fridge.","Brent","Oct 09, 2003"

Looks a pale straw yellow, with a head that leaves an incredible amount of lace on the glasss, bordering on artwork. The nose is slightly hoppy, and quiter herbal. The taste is as smooth as it can get, they should call this stuff perfect pils instead. I will have this in the house all the time. The perfect baseball beer in my opinion.","Ianhockey91","Oct 07, 2003"

For as much as I am impressed by the flavor uniqueness, that same character also limits its drinkability as you don't expect quite so much aggressiveness in a pilsner style.

No matter how slowly you pour this one, the foam is unstoppable. It took me about 10 minutes to pour it. Seriously, this is harder to pour than a Duvel. There is lots and lots of thick lacing left on the glass. The smell is hoppy and grassy, reminds me of springtime lawn mowing. The taste has the same grassy effect, with a little clove or ginger spice. There is a little bit of hops on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is just a tad bit oily.

My pour took me longer and I let the beer sit a minute or two. When I took hold of my glass once again, the beer looked fantastic  as if it were poured over on the continent (where a genuine pils pour takes longer than a Guinness), with no-quit effervescence. Aroma also matched its profile  sweet pils character, slight grassy but hoppy nose. Taste was great to boot: hop bitterness to match its thin-pils character/mouthfeel. Not a really dry lager, but complex. Prima! Think right now its the best home-grown pils Ive had yet.","Hobbz","Jun 01, 2003"

Just straight up completely and utterly stomach turning bitter. So I was pissed that I bought a bad batch and let the rest sit in the crisper. And I try one tonite, and it tastes tolerable.

The aroma presents a very quaffable bouquet of aromatic saaz hops, not much sweetness just all hops baby. Victory pulled an Emeril on this one, and kicked it up another notch. The European hops give it that classic lager crispness. The taste has a more balanced malt/hop ratio than the aroma. Slightly citrus edge to it, the bitterness leaves a trail of hop resin as it flows down the gullet. The mouthfeel is standard for a well done pilsner, very unique overall finish from this light to medium bodied beer. I could drink this regularly, very palatable and easy to drink.

The aromas that tickled my nose were fresh, sweet, spicy and hoppy. The different hop smells from fresh grass to citrus to flowers to spices came right at my nose. There were some sweet malt tones as well but the hops were the primary smells. And the taste, WOW, the taste was absolutely great. Hops took the front again, grass, lemons, cloves, hay, flowers and some spices all covered my tongue, again, there was a definite sweet malt presence as well to try to balance the hops, and does so very well. But one cannot deny that this beer was made for hops. Very bold and aggressive from the moment it touches your lips to the middle as it rushes over your tongue to the very dry finish. When I say dry, I mean dry. I swear I could actually feel every drop of moisture get sucked off of my tongue. It was like a desert in there, a bold flavorful desert that I would not mind being stranded in. Great example of this style. Loved it and was glad rotsaruch told me to try it.","Jarod","Feb 24, 2003"

4,-0.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"The archetypal pilsner color, a crystalline gold color, the head dazzling white, modest in size, creamy in its texture, the left over lace a delicate glass covering sheet. Lemon Lime fresh and crisp is the nose, dominated by the malts, quite a pleasure to sniff. Malt start, somewhat sweet, skinny at the top, finish delightful in its hop spicy crispness, spitefully acidic, dry and lingering aftertaste and a true joy to quaff.","Gusler","Dec 23, 2002"

4.7,16.6,4,4,5,5,5,"Crystal clear, light gold in color, with heavy carbonation and a thin, foamy head. Husky malt aroma with floral hoppy notes. The hops really come through in the taste, though. This is the first beer I've had where I've really understood the "fresh grass" description of hop aroma. The Saaz hops used here have a very huge herbal, flowery taste to them. The German pilsner malt is also quite heavy, making this beer fairly full-bodied and chewy, especially for the style. Finishes dry, and leaves you with an aftertaste where the hops finally start to show their bitter/spicy side -- a very nice compliment to the lingering sweetness of the malt. A very aggressive and pleasant interpretation of a distinctively *European* Pilsner. It would be very easy to drink a lot of these in a row. Thanks to Nerofiddled for the trade","mzwolinski","Dec 05, 2002"

4.15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Perhaps I was a bit overzealous to taste this one...my first attempt to drink and review ended with my underestimating the Prima's carbonation. Despite my attempts at a nice pour, half of the bottle shot from the glass and ended up in my lap. My second attempt at pouring was much more successful. It yielded a cloudy, hazy appearance with a light golden color. An excellent head formed (1/2-inch or so), with very nice retention. A luxuriant hop aroma was apparent, as well as a faint maltiness. The pronounced hop bitterness attacked my tongue first, followed by a nice malt foundation. I was really pleased by the taste and excellent overall pilsener characteristics. The Pils has a very full and somewhat creamy mouthfeel, and the fizziness seemed to magnify in my mouth. This filling carbonation made me want to wait a little while longer between beers, but the Pils remains a very drinkable, enjoyable lager.","SchmichaelJ","Nov 27, 2002"

Overall a supreme drinking beer.","AaronRed","Nov 21, 2002"

Golden-straw colored with a puffy white head...the aroma is slightly herbal and resinous. The taste is incredible. I think it's the hoppiness that did it for me....a big hop bitterness and a dry finish seem to come out of nowhere. This isn't my style, but the beer is fantastic.","Suds","Nov 18, 2002"

It has distinctive refreshing and crisp taste. The hop flavor is plentiful and pleasing with a malty presense in the background. The finish is big and hoppy, satisfying beyond belief on the hottest summer day. An impressive German-style pilsner.","rotsaruch","Nov 18, 2002"

This is a pal golden beer that pours with a very nice head that lasts well and leaves a nice lace.  The aroma is spicy hops, with a hint of something that I can only call a pine-like smell for lack of better terminology.  The mouthfeel is very full bodied and silky.  It has a nice hops kick in the aftertaste, but the malt is very present in the mouth.  This may be my favorite lager(Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold is close).  A little aggressive on the hops for the style perhaps, but it works very well.   Might not a good "crossover' beer for macro friends, but a fine beer indeed.   After a few drinks, this one started to disappear quickly.  And I like to savor my beers!  Glad I have six of them.  I've yet to be disappointed in Victory.","aaronh","Oct 25, 2002"
4.32,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A friend who works at West Virginia Brewery recommended that I really check out everything Victory has to offer about six months ago when i started getting into beer, real beer that is.  I finally bought some Prima Pils and am glad I waited so long to get it; it allowed me to learn some properties to look for in a beer.  The color is a very slightly cloudish light light golden yellow and the lace it leaves on my pint glass is heavy.  Head was light to non exsistant and first impression of taste of pretty bitter but bitter in the way a grapefruit is-having some sweetness properties deep down in its flavor.  There is a hopiness taste also to it, but of far less stregnth than the bitterness or the hidden sweetness.  The carbonation is light/medium and the lack of weight of a pilsner leaves a good mouthfeel.  Only detraction from this beer is that it's too bitter to drink a bunch of, but in respect to one of the nations foremost microbrewers you probably shouldnt do that anyways. (not to mention your wallet)","allboutbierge","Oct 16, 2002"
5,24.1,5,5,5,5,5,"A hopheads pils. This beer will hook you and not let go. Very suprising how dry and hoppy. Definitely will change the way you look at a pils. I'm not sure if this beer is true to its form (everything is but quite hoppy), but who cares its great. Victory has an ongoing series of single hop pils, all great but different.","boblinneman","Sep 30, 2002"
4.72,17.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is definitely not a beer for the uninitiated. The dryness of the hops is very intense but blends beautifully with the whole refreshing, grassy, floral thing rather than just coming off as an astringent afternote. I love this beer and I think it is one of the supreme brewing accomplishments in this country.","Riggo","Sep 10, 2002"
3.65,-9.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The color was a pale yellow with very little foam and a medium amount of lace of the side of the glass. The smell or malts and hops have a pleasant aroma. The taste of malts and hops were a sort on the bitter side. Flavor wise, it was lacking the flavor I was expecting from a Victory Ale. Just a tad to bitter for my taste!","BeerManDan","Sep 04, 2002"
3.61,-10.4,3.5,2.5,4,4,4,"I was told not to try this beer, as two of my fellow beer lovers hated it. So for this reason alone I had to try it. The smell upon cracking open the bottle was quite harsh...overpowering actually. I thought the taste would be similar but the bitterness I expected was not there. Extremely hoppy with a spicy bite both initially and in the aftertaste, but this is quite tasty. Very different from any other Pils I have tasted, and well worth it for its unique qualities.","IrishRedRock","Aug 22, 2002"
3.86,-4.2,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Prima Pils: from Victory, strong aroma of hops assaults the nose as soon as it hits the glass.  Huge head, in fact I think we might have a winner in the on-going quest from height above the rim: two full inches!  The beer itself is extremely hoppy, with pine flavors after the initial bite. Light in body, with a nice refreshing clean finish.  Very nice.","jackndan","Aug 20, 2002"
4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly hazy, bright golden color with a soft, creamy head that holds up fairly well. The aroma is intensely hoppy - bright and fresh - with a grassy and somewhat spicy character. A crisp carbonation and medium body join to create a full mouthfeel. The flavor is bold: Generously malty, but then it needs to be, to support the mouth-watering and solid hop flavor. Quite aggressive. The finish is big and hoppy, leaving a resiny dryness. A bold German-style pilsner, not so much seductive as it is dominating.","NeroFiddled","Aug 11, 2002"
4.57,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This one pours a golden color with a solid head and some really nice lace. The smell is somewhat grassy. This tastes great. Big hop flavor for the style, which as a hop head, I love. Prima Pils is certainly an easy drinking beer, but probably not for the faint of heart. It's easily the best pilsner I've ever sampled and is another winner from Victory. As one who generally doesn't enjoy this style, I'm impressed.","Jon","Aug 10, 2002"
4.01,-0.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Okay, this beer poured a dark yellow color and formed a white bubbley head that left some nice lace.  The aroma, well, let's just say the hops exploded in my olfactory area.  There was also some grassy, earthy elements.  The flavor, once again, was most definately hops.  Also present was malt and citrus.  The finish was fairly dry.  One of the best pils I have had, but I admit to not being a big fan of the style.","Wildman","Jul 30, 2002"
3.84,-4.7,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pleasing pale yellow with sticky head, wonderful hoppy scent. The malts are so mild, they are hardly even there. Just a faint wisp at the bottom of the flavor. Hops are the crux of this beer; incredibly floral with hints of grass, ending with a resoundingly bitter finish. Hopheads should be in paradise, and this is indeed a tasty, appetizing beer... but to my tastes it's a bit too much with the hops, ends up being very American (in the distinctive Cascade/Sierra piney hop way), and the bitterness just borders on the abrasive. Not quite balanced. I would kick up the malt a notch and make the hops less floral and more towards grass/dried hay. The water is a bit hard too, I wonder if they could make it a little creamier. For a truly exceptional American pilsner, my vote's with Brooklyn.","Thrasher","Jul 25, 2002"
4.43,9.9,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Pours a brilliant gold-straw with a foamy white head that really stuck to the glass. Very aromatic, you can smell the floral hops in the nose.

A great summertime beer and truly outstanding example of the style","pheurton","Jul 24, 2002"
3.99,-1,2.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The thick ivory - white head tops a hazy straw - hued brew.  Smooth bready grain aroma w/ a slightly spicy Saaz hop nose.  Assertive bitterness upfront followed by mellow toasty malt sweetness.  Spicy & lightly grassy Saaz hop flavor.  Finishes w/ bready notes ending abruptly and a lingering, clean hop bitterness.  Prima Pils is a tasty pilsner that is refreshingly bitter... probably the most bitter Pilsner I've tasted.","marc77","Jul 21, 2002"

Taste has hops way out front, but with enough malt to hold it together. Still some proper balance despite hop lead. Malt presence is more subtle, more noticeable with each sip. Probably my favorite pils. Unlike many pils, wouldn't give this to a beer novice (I'd use their All Malt Lager instead). Another gem from Bill and Ron.","RonfromJersey","Jul 13, 2002"

Slight citrus, lemon, hops crisp aroama. Very balanced taste, super crisp hops dominate the start, then a very balanced middle.Unlike any other alleged Pilsener I have had.  Finishes crisp and strong, with a lingering hop/lemon combination on your taste buds. Unbelievable pilsner, I only have memories of Sam Adams Golden Pilsner about 5 years ago, but this is an outstanding beer. I had alone, but would pair perfectly with a spicy bbq, or anyother summertime activity. Another Victory beer that lives up to the hype....","StevieW","Jun 22, 2002"

Victory can do no wrong.","mickeymac","Jun 09, 2002"

Smells zesty, lemony, herbal, floral. Saaz! Taste is unlike any pils I've ever tasted; there are so many dimensions to the flavors, yet there is incredible balance as well. Initial taste is of lemon zest and grass, then a long, lingering floral/herbal earthiness, followed by a smooth, sweet finish. On any level, this beer is hard to beat.","mophie","Jun 07, 2002"

Has a somewhat sharp malt aroma that is not displeasing.  Amazingly bitter for a Pilsner and is probably what makes me like it so much.  All around it's pretty balanced with a solid malt body.  Not very complex in the full scope of beer, but very complex when compared to others of its style.  I liked it's refreshing taste and drinkability.
