APPEARANCE: champagne-like effervescence; crystal clear and golden yellow; vast, foamy white three-finger head; lacing represents confidently throughout ... AROMA: bread/dough malts mix with a metallic sharpness; some funky yeasts as well--not really appealing... PALATE: reasonably smooth; a flat finish; aftertaste is plausible; drinkable but not very memorable....TASTE: a liquid English muffin whose malts end in a woody, almost lagerish base; some corny residual, though thank God that's not a likely German adjunct... OVERALL: a pilsener that occupies the mouth for a few moments--crisp yet nondescript, Warsteiner is a year-rounder that probably needs a pairing (holiday party, dinner, snack?) to succeed...otherwise, a beer that's a bit more fun to say or see than it is to sip or savor...","dacrza1","Nov 07, 2014"

The color is a gorgeous golden hue with perfect carbonation levels although the head retention was just about non existent. There is very little aroma. I certainly sensed that I was indulging in a mix of Pilsner and Munich malts balanced with noble hops. A very difficult style to nail but this beer is more than solid. Hop heads need not apply...I had this with a spicy Cajun shrimp dish and it was perfect.","Reegze79","Aug 11, 2014"

Sure, there is a time and a place for this particular brew and it just so happens to be summertime now.","JamesMN","Jul 31, 2014"

I'm picking up some sweetness like camel or resins. Warsteiner Premium Verum goes down real nice and smooth with a clean finish. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. I'm really liking this brew. This is a well balance brew. Nothing over powering in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a solid 4 out of 5. This is better than what I expected.

However I prefer the competition (namely bitburger). The hops are just not aggressive enough for my taste. The malt flavor is similarly soft. Don't get me wrong I don't think Warsteiner is bad, it's brewed for those who enjoy a softer pils. I however do not belong to that group.

The initial swig presented a very honey-like sweetness initially before the grassy hops kicked in. The mouthfeel was on the low end of medium, not quite thin, but not much over the line, either. Finish was mmmellow and it was a very pleasant reminder of why I like Pilseners, whether they be German or Czech in style. I would definitely have some of this in my cooler when headed to the beach, the backyard, or even for Hula in the Coola Day (01 February, annually). Worth an attempt at seeking out.

It's not particularly strong, but is definitely more than passable for a pilsner refreshment. The carbonation is very fine but adequate and the body is medium-light. It has a smooth, glassy feel, substantial enough to satisfy and deliver a highly drinkable and refreshing beer. I find this just tasty enough to enjoy without complaint and safe enough to really put away in mass quantities.

Now, I can report that it's a smooth, creamy, very drinkable Pilsner.

There is a nice note of malts in the aroma, which are not overpowering but are easy to distinguish. There is also a lightly hopped sensation to it. Not skunked up like some German pilseners, probably thanks to the brown bottle.

Combined it kinda smells like piss, I hate to say that but its honestly the best I can do. Taste is fine. Pretty well balanced, some malt and some grassy hops, slightly bitter aftertaste.

The taste is quite thin, crisp, there are some interesting grassy notes to the beer, some lemony hints, but this isn't a beer I'm all that excited about.

Taste is malty and sweet with bready overtones and a very slight hoppiness. Carbonation is very low and makes the beer seem almost flat. My personal opinion is that this beer would benefit with a slight bit more carbonation and a bit more hoppiness to balance out the sweetness. My final thoughts, this beer is nothing special.","LarryV","Jun 12, 2008"

The head fizzles lightly and quickly, leaving no lacing or trace atop the brew (apparently appropriate for the hop extract, but not for a German pilsner, which should have long-lasting head). Bubbly carbonation is evident start to finish. The aroma and taste are both very clean. Light malt undertones to a grassy hops aroma lead the nose into a similarly light taste. Mild malt flavor hits the tip of the tongue for just a moment before bitterness takes over through the dry, refreshing finish and aftertaste. High carbonation adds both to the sense of bitter bite as well as to the lightness. Highly drinkable and refreshing, light and crisp with a good amount of bitter.

No skunk.The taste is simple and sweet. Most impresive was the overall mouthfeel exerpeience. This was SO smooth to the tounge. Due to that and the lack of too much skunk this was incredibly easy to drink. Almost a pleasure. There was a small level of euroskunk taste but not too much. And for 2 bucks a pop at the Keg(basement of the german house) this is a bargain.","kbnooshay","Apr 27, 2006"

From a bottle, the cap was dismal at best and was gone before I had time to write down the smell category. But the coloring was attractive for the style. A nice pale golden and very clear. The smell was a little sweet but with light citrus and floral hops. Has the familiar macro-cereal grain nose. Taste is has a mild malty sweetness that finishes with a nice mellow hop bite to bring it down. Carbonation is high on this one, and comes a live real fast. Does leave a nice aftertaste.

Funny how when I drink this beer I always have a Pavlovian association with being reminded about David Beckham being sent off against Argentina though, 8 years on and that still hurts. For the price though, Ill certainly be stocking up with some Warsteiner for the 2006 World Cup as it is being held in Germany, no beer from the official sponsor for me, but I just hope Beckham behaves himself this time around!","TheLongBeachBum","Jan 27, 2006"

Leaning towards hops vice malt but no real strong taste. Mouthfeel was good, carbonation just right and no real aftertaste. I had this after a horrible tasting Koenig Ludwig Hefe Weizen (until I try it again, I am blaming this one on a keg that might have been tapped the day before!!!). The Warsteiner went down nice after this one. I like stronger tasting beers better, but I wouldn't turn down the Premium Verum if offered one.

Pours a one finger nearly white head over a crystal clear pale straw colored liquid. Smells pils malty with really nice noble hop floral (the hops give some hint of melon in the nose) and some saltine crackers. Hallertauer would be my guess. Taste is quite strong hops, but it's supported nicely with a malt sweet. Hops are noble and taste kinda like mushrooms. Hop bitter is minimal, but comes across late and as kinda flat due to an oily hop character that lays on the tongue. Body is light and carbonation is strong.

The head is a nice white atop the beer, a very pale gold in color and crystal clear. The aroma is a nice blend of floral hops and sweet maltiness, not really strong but nice. I bought this from the back of the shelf to avoid skunkiness & I seem to have succeeded. The flavor is a pleasant blend of malt and hops with nothing really dominant - kind of dry but enough malty umph to back up the hop flavor and bitterness, which lingers on the back of the tongue in the finish.

This is the flavor I’ve had lately, most notably with DFH Lawnmower, which I don’t like in beers. However, it is muted here and finishes clean and dry.

The mouthfeel was a bit too bland, bordering on rough. The smoothness in the taste was pretty much absent in the feel and the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is a little harsh, but somewhat typical for an average Pils. A slight lingering aftertaste is distracting and tough to identify. Almost like cardboard. Drinkability OK. It's better than most US Macro lagers, but there a plenty of better beers out there in this price range. It may suffer a bit due to transportation.

The head was very sudsy and evaporated somewhat quickly but did leave some slippery lacing. The smell was much like any pale lager, perhaps a bit hoppier. This does not seem classic pilsener style as the hops do not seem like Saaz as would be found in, say, a Pilsner Urquell. The flavor is good, not great, and this is very drinkable. Fairly high carbonation leaves a crisp feel in the finish. Better than many domestics if nothing better is around.

Aroma is distant and weak with thin earthy hops, and a clean pilsen fermentation. Mouthfeel is soft with a wet, crisp finish. Body is light. Taste begins with mild husken pale malts, immediately fading into a prolonged husky bitterness with a bright palate.

Smell is faint malt and hop, some what skunky but didn't seem to echo in the taste, at least not all together. Taste was crisp and clean, much like a light pilsner. Although it didn't have much malty sweetness, there is a hint of herb-like hop dry bitterness.

The color of the slight head and rim were white, and there was no lace present. The aroma was crisp and had hints of malt and hops.
