Bright, snappy, doughy, lemony,a  touch dusty and with an intense hop oil and a ltitle bit of soap. The palate opens rather intensely bitter with a blend of mint, lemon peel, fresh herbs and some soap. Dough, honey, a little bread appear on the mid palate before a long, bitter and lemony finish take over. Soapy (again), this beer is light in body and pleasant on the palate. Crisp carbonation keeps this snappy and the combination of hop oils and bitterness is enjoyable, though not in the sense that the classics are.","DefenCorps","Mar 27, 2015"

Decent precipitating carbonation.  Nose is bready and a bit sweet.  In the mouth not too bubbly but certainly crisp, smooth and quenching.  Taste is bready malted barley nicely balanced against hops.  Clean finish.  Overall a pretty solid pilsner; nothing to write home about but decent.  Would try again.","jettjon","Mar 25, 2015"

4.41,15.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a clear golden body with a half finger creamy white head that stuck around the entire glass. Overall impression of appearance is of a classic, perfectly executed German Pilsner. Scents of light, grainy Pilsner malt, a very light hint of graham cracker and floral, perfume-like and spicy noble hops at medium-low levels. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic German Pilsner, very true to style and quite simple and clean. Flavor begins lightly dry with notes of grainy malt and medium levels of floral noble hop flavors. A very light Pilsner malt sweetness sits in the background. Middle continues with medium-high flavors of spicy and floral noble hops, dominating the flavor profile, but with a light maltiness that is mostly grainy. Finish is dry, continuing with medium-high levels of noble hop flavors with hints of grainy malt in the background. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of floral and spicy noble hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a crisp, clean, dry German Pilsner, perfect for the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to style German Pilsner, nothing wrong at all. Overall this is an excellent German Pilsner. It is true to style in every respect, which translates into a crisp, flavorful, noble hop dominated, refreshing beer. Well worth trying.","Auraan","Mar 10, 2015"

The hops are too floral, the mouthfeel is too sticky and the beer never comes together as more than the sum of its parts. Just goes to show you how hard it is to get this style right, despite the best examples of it being so criminally underrated here (Jever Pilsener's rAvg is a laughable 3.56).

This wipes out Scrimshaw, The Crisp, and most every other American-made pils that isn't going for "hoppy pils."

This beer had ok drinkability it was smooth, a little crisp, fairly creamy, slightly filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think one is enough for me, the flavor doesn't really make me want to come back for more and the mouthfeel holds back the drinkability.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was one damn good looking Pilsener.  What I like the least about this beer is the mouthfeel, it could use some work.  I don't think I would buy this again, but I for sure wouldn't turn it down.  I can't say I would recommend it as a great Pilsener, but it's worth a try if you like the German Pilseners.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, it had just a couple aspects that held it back from being as good as it could be, but in the end it was still a nice example of the style and I didn't mind it.  Keep up the solid works guys, I think a little bit of work could make this a really nice beer.","StoutHunter","Jan 28, 2015"

Dry, biscuity malts compliment the hops nicely. Hoppier than a traditional pils I guess but this is a damn satisfying drink.

Biscuit like with a snap of hoppy balance.  Mouthfeel feel is light and effervescent.

Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, lime, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of earthy/spicy hops and bready pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, lime, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, cracker, biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of earthy/spicy hops and bready pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice German Pilsener style. All around great balance and robustness of earthy/spicy hops and bready pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 16, 2015"

All of the hops used are traditional, except for the Saphir.  There's something about this hop when used as a replacement for traditional Noble Hops that doesn't sit well with my palate -- or my expectation of traditional lager styles.  Personally, I'll stick with Trumer as a go-to Pils and enjoy SN's Summerfest for a seasonal.","steveh","Jan 16, 2015"
