I wish I had a six pack of this as the beer is very drinkable, but I got this one bottle as a gift so it will be awhile before I can locate another.  Overall, a well crafted pilsner/lager, but not as hoppy as I would have expected for a German Pilsner - the malt is the theme for this beer and it shows nicely.  This beer went very well with food (Chicken schnitzel, green beans) and I think it would go very well with a wider range of food as well.  A great overall lager.","damndirtyape","Jan 01, 2015"

Sweet bready maltiness without much to provide balance. Fruity flavor seems out of place in a clean lager. Easy enough to drink but needs some tweaking.","johnnnniee","Nov 14, 2014"

4,5,,,,,,"On our way through Rt. 90 across the great midwest, Wisconsin was a gem of a state.  After countless hours of SD tourist trap desperation, our very first WI gas stop produced a store with a full aisle of New Glarus, cheese and meat sticks.  After days of Wyoming evil eyes and South Dakota biker madness, Wisconsin was amazing.  My first purchase was a mixed 12er of New Glarus that  included Two Women Lager.  I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot after a couple bottles of Spotted Cow, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This one pours a little darker than your average pils, and has a very pleasant, soft malt flavor.  The hops are understated, but I don't feel like this is a nouveau-american pils with a blast of spicy european hops.  I like that, but I'm enjoying the mellowed feel of this beer.  It may not be flashy, but this is a rock solid beer worthy of attention.  I'd happily host a BBQ with a few of these.","UnionMade","Aug 21, 2014"

Balanced hopping brings the tasty malts to a very clean and drinkable level but, I find the lack of carbonation to give the beer a somewhat slick and flat feel; it's not quite lively enough which would coincidentally reflect Deb's personality well!","BeerFMAndy","Jul 23, 2014"

It's a little thick, highly carbonated. All in all, this is a very good lager, but I don't buy it as a pilsner - more like a dortmunder or even a bock.

The barley is almost creamy, with subtle caramel and toffee. You might even mistake it for an Irish red. The hops just provide balancing bitterness to this amber lager. Maybe I taste a touch of citrus in the finish, I can't say for certain. As it warms, I get a touch of grass in the aroma. There's a little fruit, but I think it's coming from the malt. This is an easy-drinking crowd-pleaser, but also a finely-crafted lager. It's closer to Spotted Cow than Home Town.","tempest","Dec 24, 2012"

Taste is smooth with some apple juice, some metal, some grain and bits of white grape juice over hay and standard lager flavors. Thin with low carb and a semi dry yet wet finish.

3.97,4.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O – This is a really tasty pilsner, but I’m not sure how well it fits the German pilsner mold. Good German pilsners are very pale and have a touch of grainy malts, but most of the taste and mouthfeel is dominated by bitter hops. This particular beer, as evidenced by the color, has a much stronger malt presence than is indicated. Don’t get me wrong – it’s still a really good and drinkable beer. However, I think it would fit better in the Bohemian pilsner category. After checking New Glarus’ website, I can’t fault them on trueness to style (even on the appearance) since they list the beer as a “classic country lager.” The “German pilsner” is probably just the BA category that it happened to be boxed into. Regardless of any of that nonsense, this is a solid pilsner. Nice job, New Glarus.","BlackBelt5112203","Oct 28, 2012"

I get a lot of Munich malt and even a touch of rye esque spice. It's unique and nice for the style. It drinks light in body and has nice flavor. It's a really nice take on a darker lager. This beer would make a great gateway into craft. I'm a fan. This beer is incredibly sessionable.","aasher","Apr 08, 2012"

The initial taste was slightly hoppy with a smooth but slight wheat flavor. Made in the style of a pilsener, there is not going to be anything to knock the socks off of most beer drinkers aside from the smoothness. It is a gateway type beer for non-craft beer drinking.

After about a minute, a good half a inch of head is still sticking around and does so for the entirety of the pull. The aroma is fairly complex for a pilsener. Candy apples mixed with caramel and toasted bread. Nice yeasty esters. Malt backbone is pretty prevalent with just a bit of earthy hops. The flavor tells you that this is a pretty malty lager. Caramel apples with toasted bread and yeasty biscuits. Underlying the malt is just a hint of earthy hops. Very clean and straightforward. Really tasty. The mouthfeel is clean and dry with a medium carbonation. This is a great lager by a great brewery. Definitely wish I could get this year round.","hwwty4","Sep 07, 2011"

Flavors fail to uplift the experience, appearing too predictable and even unaccomplished. The texture provides the biggest surprise, showing more resistance than one might expect from the style--which is also not helped by the lack of effervescence. As for the style classification, its position here as a Bavarian pilsner does the beer no favors.

Lighter side of medium bodied, nice and crisp texture. Smells of strong biscuit malts, lager style, and floral / earth hops. Tastes of the same but also includes grassy hop notes and a medium bittering back kick which I would estimate at about half the bitterness of a normal Pilsener. Not the most complex NG offering I've ever had, but than again it seems to be another of their lineup that sticks to the basics and do the simple things as well as possible.

There is also a very faint metallic note in the background that adds to the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture and fairly high carbonation.

Of course, there are some very impressive (and authentic) renditions of the Pilsener style out there from the Craft brewers these days, so this is by no means an 'average' American beer in this respect.

I say gulp because this is a very quaffable beer. The aroma is quite simple; fresh malt and maybe some grass hops. The taste reminds me quite a bit of Bohemian lager more than a German Pilsener, something perhaps like a Czechvar...but upon further reflection it is also reminds me of a Wurzburger Pils which I suppose is what the brewer is really trying to emulate. A touch of caramel malt, some toasted malt, some very fresh (almost worty) malt flavor is present here with a touch of bubblegum and mild graininess. Maybe I just worked extra hard today, this is very quaffable, with the right amount of hops to make me wish I picked up a case of this stuff.","marcobrau","May 11, 2011"

Taste consistent with nose; however, it's a bit more watery than I anticipated. There's also a trace of citric acid in the mix. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a slight acidity and a fairly clean finish. All and all a very drinkable, style consistent German Pils.

Flavor is very smooth and balanced. This is really holding up well with age. Crisp, crackery and biscuity malt base. Flowery hops balance everything out nicely. Nice accents of hay as well. Herbal and eathry. Body is medium full. Moderate carbaonation. Very good pilsener.","Bighuge","Oct 25, 2010"

Sometimes even a Lager can be quite sublime, this has to be at least a bit past its prime and it is still quite fantastic.","Gueuzedude","Oct 15, 2010"

4.57,19.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The palate opens with a delicate hop character, with the aromas I picked up on the nose all being represented. Mostly hay-like with some wet earth, the hop character segues into the very rustic malt character. While this beer has a very light body, it isn't lacking for malt flavors - the raw grain, graham cracker and light toast bring to my mind what was (IMO) Dan's best beer, the Unplugged Bohemian Lager. Very, very clean, there are no off-flavors here. Again, despite being light, there's enough flavor to tingle every tastebud, making this seem about as far from watery as you can get. Carbonation is medium-light, lower than I'm used to but sufficient. The finish is long and delicate, with the lemon characteristics appearing along with the earthy and grassy flavors lingering a long, long time. This is on par with the Victory Braumeister Pils in terms of quality. Exceptional stuff.","DefenCorps","Sep 02, 2010"

It seems like a beer that could easily be sold in a traditional six-pack. That being said, Two Women is a very good German Pilsener. If you enjoy typical German Pilseners, I highly recommend trying this.","Cubsfan1087","Jul 11, 2010"
