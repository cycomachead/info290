Pours a translucent light golden yellow color with an inch of frothy white head. Some lacing. Aromas of cut grass, floral hops, some grains, and sourdough bread. Taste is grassy with some floral hops upfront followed by a slightly sour finish. A bit bready. Crisp and really drinkable. Bit of a floral bitter aftertaste. This is my go-to beach beer.

First hit was crisp, cleah, AHHH. Peppery at first, smooth at the end. If you like the style this beer is definitely for you, definitely an ADB ( all day brew ). Just a straight forward lager with just that little bit of UMPH, maybe the pepper, that keeps this selection from being riding mower boring.

The nose is simple and fresh, featuring German hops with a fine-grain roughness to them and some lightly bready malt notes. Not too forward, but easy going and pretty. On the palate, light sweetness mixing with light, green bitterness before drying out and getting quite a bit more bitter toward the end. Juicy carbonation and the perfect combination of smooth malts and just a touch of rough hop oils to make things interesting. I can't say enough about this lager. It's so easy to drink and yet so tasty; every element of it is spot-on to style and well-developed in its own way. Just an excellent lager.

Excellent drinkability as it's easy drinking, light, and quite refreshing with a nice hop profile. Low abv makes this a true summer session brew or maybe a lawn mower beer. Either or, get it if you can.","bjohnson","Jan 18, 2007"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pale gold with extremely active carbonation and a fluffy, sticky pristine-white head. Lovely, subtle herbal spice aromas, just slightly sulfuric but mostly vegetal in character. Solid pilsner nose. Bready malts fight the good fight against a barrage of noble hop spiciness; the malt seems to win out initially in the finish, then accedes to the hop spice yet again. However, they triumph in the long aftertaste. Feels somewhat full on the palate, given the style -- but I really like it! This is a "heavier" pilsner, one that is not quite as crisp and clean as others. But it's got the advantage of holding its own in colder weather due to its substantial body. A pilsner appropriate for winter. Will buy again.","orfeu","Dec 14, 2006"

Easy does it. This is, all around, a decent brew. Ah, there it is. It's light, easy-going and not too high in alc..

A bright-white dollop of creamy foam rises above its clear golden body, and holds quite well, leaving rings of craggy lace throughout the glass. The nose is clearly laden with bright and vibrant Hallertau hops over a delicately sweet pilsner malt base. In the mouth it's smooth and gently crisp with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation and medium body. The flavor delivers a superbly balanced combination of clean, lightly-sweet pilsner malt; grassy, lightly citrusy, floral and mildly herbal hops; and a supportive bitterness that keeps it's malt in check and leads to a dry finish.

Head retention was fair, the foam slipped to a soapy cap. Subsequent lacing was unorganized and spotty. This beer is pleasant looking, better than ordinary. The nose is interesting. My first sniff caused be to check the can again, yep, it is a lager. The nose doesnt convince me of that. Sure the citrusy-herbal-grassy smells say German but the lack of malty aromas and the lack of distinctive lager cleanliness throw me for a loop. Hell, there is even a dull fruitiness that reminds me of an ale. Who cares! This is a Pilsner of sorts; Ill leave it at that. The potency is moderate but Im able to hear what this beer is saying. Inviting. The palate, again, is more ale-like (to me) than lager-like. Why? The lack of a malt backbone. There is no typical Pilsner maltiness, the flavors that are presented are lively with a twang of citrus, some lemon-grass, then some herbalness and even some random fruitiness. It is not very bitter but there are some flowery moments. I cant convince myself that Elm City Lager is really a German Pilsner. I dont need to convince myself that this is a damn tasty beer! I really like. True, the palate is simple and this beer is not a thinker, its a drinker! Super easy to quaff and enjoy. This beer, in the can, would be a welcome sight for all outdoor activities. Medium/medium-light in body, low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is very pleasant. The body fits the flavors ideally (oddly, considering it lacks malty oomph on the tongue). Like I said, it is very tasty and easy to drink. It is a session beer for a lazy-mental day. Thanks UnionMade! Good beer in a can is still a fun novelty for me!","bditty187","Aug 15, 2004"

Malts seem to be toasted a little bit which gives it a nice kick combined with the spicy hops. A little bit peppery at times I've noticed as well. The aftertaste had that peppery taste to it, but wasn't overwhelming. This went down nice and easy.
