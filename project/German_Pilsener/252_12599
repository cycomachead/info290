Aroma -  smells of wheat. Taste - not sure if I haven't had a beer for a along time but initial thoughts are that this is a fantastic beer, very mild tasting, refreshing easy beer to drink. Wheaty taste. Mouthfeel - some carbonation, not overwhelming, it complements the beer if anything. Overall - really liked this beer, one of the better cool fermented beers I have had.","50wolves","Mar 21, 2015"

4.12,5.4,4.25,4,4,5,4,"Color is straw golden and perfectly clear.  Pours one finger worth of a fizzy white head.  Aroma is subtle, but consists of a little floral hop spiciness and a sweet dry malt.  Taste is along the same lines with mildly nutty pilsner malts upfront followed by a crisp spicy/herbal hop bite that follows to the finish.  Neither the hop or malt really overtake each other, yet both are showcased very well and are very complimentary of each other.  The feel is pretty dry, but there's enough malt to add some smoothness to the finish.  Light to medium bodied, medium to high carbonation, and perfectly clean in the finish. Just a great beer all round with great flavor and balance, and  the perfectly crisp/clean feel that you want from a pilsner.","CTbrew32","Jan 02, 2015"

The more you drink of the Weihen, the more you can taste the malt, hop, and yeast character differences between it and the SN Pils.  This makes me wonder (again) about Pasteurization and also the use of U.S. 2 row.  Overall, you can't go wrong with this Pilsner if you want to taste a good example.","steveh","Dec 11, 2014"

This one, a Bavarian pils, tastes a bit more like a Czech one too me, probably due to its proximity and overall historic influence in the previously German-speaking areas of the Czech Republic where the pilsner style was invented.","Beric","Aug 05, 2013"

I put this in the same class as Stoudt's pilsner and Victory Prima Pils. Pours a clear straw colored body with a bright white head that generously laces the glass. Very fresh, clean aromas here. Nothing icky to speak of, even after it warms. I get a lot of grassiness and sweeter notes of honey and cereal grains. On the palate this beer is very lively and electric. The aromas carry over perfectly to the front and mid-palate, where they are in perfect balance, before finishing on a refreshingly dry and almost tart.

It pours pale yellow, a bright hay color. Quite clear. A big white head puffed up immediately and held its shape a good few inches over the top of the glass. Lots of bubbles sticking to the walls of the glass and such. Aroma is a mix of very fresh grain with some bright spicy hops. The hops are a bit milder than I'd like, but their aroma is nice. Pleasant, lightly tart flavor from the lager yeast. Malt is light and sweet. Taste has more of that light, yeasty tartness. Pretty crisp. There's some more of that quality pilsner malt sweetness, but the beer is fairly dry, particularly in the finish. Hops are spicy, grassy and floral. Mouthfeel is mildly tart and very clean. Weihenstephaner definitely shows off their technical skill with this beer. It just nails the classic pilsner flavors. It's tasty and extremely easy to drink. There's no off flavors to be found. This beer is pretty much what I wish macro lagers tasted like.","popery","Mar 09, 2013"

Pours almost crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a nice amount of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of apple, pear, bready grain, grass, floral, and herbal spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; very pleasant. Taste of pear, apple, bready grain, pepper, floral, grass, herbal spiciness, and slight sulfur as it warms. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apple, pear, pepper, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance, with good complexity and fullness of flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Extremely easy to drink as expected. Overall this is an all around excellent pilsner. Great flavor balance and smoothness; with a nice crisp and flavorful finish. Weihenstephaner just knows how to nail a classic German style.","superspak","Jul 08, 2012"

Munich malt mingles with the pale. Flavor is fairly assertive for style and there is a decent finish of malt and hops -that is, actual beer ingredients. Other pilsners take note: this is a German pils with some attitude. Nice citric note in the middle for complexity raises my score a hair. ","BretSikkink","Feb 25, 2012"

Nose is soft, subtle and floral. Really pleasant. Brilliantly flavourful without being overpowering or in your face. Like a hot chick walking down the street who knows she's hot but she doesn't acknowledge all the dudes staring at her.
