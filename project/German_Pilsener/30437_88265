3.88,4.6,3.5,3.5,4,4.25,4,"Pours very clear bright gold. Thick half inch of white foam. Nose is light pilsy bitter. German style. Clean open firm hop that balances out. Nice blend, with a notch higher bitter than a typical pils. Crisp finish. Some citrus. Very good.","KTCamm","Mar 24, 2013"

4.12,11.1,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Clear pale gold in the glass with a big frothy white head that is lacing a lot. The smell is a bit faint but of pale malts and spicy hops. This beer is described as a dry hopped pilsner and that seems evident by the fresh hop bite in the taste which is actually much more noticeable than I was expecting. Noble hops provide much of the base which is appropriate for the style, bitterness and hop flavor is a bit higher than normal but in a good way. The base of this beer is a pale malt providing a fresh bread taste and mouthfeel. The yeasts provide a typical lager profile mostly clean but with a touch of spice. This beer is quite lively as the result of a good dose of carbonation and the tingly hop bitterness. The finish is pretty clean with just a hint of the pale malt and slightly bigger hit of hoppy spice and bitterness hanging around. Overall I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a good example of an often overlooked style perhaps updated a bit with the extra dose of hops. This brewery happens to just a short drive from where I live so I'm excited that it looks like I'll have a good local brewer to support, something that there are too few of in CT.","fank2788","Feb 22, 2013"
3.74,0.8,4.25,3.25,3.75,4,4,"O/D-Tasty but could have been better. Not my favorite from this new brewery but its actually a pretty legit US Pils. Probably won't get a six pack for myself again however, I would buy this for a friend or take it to a gathering as it is very agreeable yet still has enough zing.","VelvetExtract","Feb 15, 2013"
3.56,-4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light straw color with a half inch of head. Very little lacing. The aroma is of spicy hops, grass and sweet bread. The taste is more of the same. Bready at first followed by some spicy hops. Some floral notes along with some sourdough bread. Slightly bitter. Has a bit of a sour flavor to it. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. A little hoppier than most beers of this style. Overall, its not a bad beer to grab once in awhile.","PicoPapa","Feb 14, 2013"

4.15,11.9,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"Peppery, resinous hop bitterness up front. Spicy, noble hop flavors preside over soft, bready, cookie-ish malt. Light sweetness, but the dry, spicy hop bitterness dominates, thankfully. Moderate body with a lively, refreshing feel. A very nice addition to the CT beer scene. Will be buying more of this as the weather gets warmer.","alexgash","Jan 18, 2013"

I'm glad I bought a sixer, though - I was pleasantly surprised after tasting the beer, and would say it's one of the better American pilsners out there. I've only seen this brewery's beers in one place, but will definitely be on the lookout for any other offerings, and this one again.","diddly","Jan 06, 2013"

3.82,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Entry is full, yet somewhat crisp on the palate. Lots of grain flavors, followed by a mild hop kick. Tastes a little 'heavy' for a pils, but still, very enjoyable. My wife enjoyed a full pint, and she is averse to micros. So that is saying something. I would definitely have another pint next time i see it on tap.","nebula1999","Dec 23, 2012"
