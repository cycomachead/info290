Wheat with faint spices and orange and lemon zest. The taste is so incredibly wonderfully balanced-- something NG has mastered. Some of their beers may be a little more subtle, but man do they do it well. Some really pleasant wheat. A little bit of grassiness, and some nice orange and lemon notes. A small amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. Really easy to drink. Crisp and refreshing, perfect drink for the end of the summer. Well carbonated.

4.17,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Picked up a single at Casanova in Hudson, WI. It's dry, crisp, and hoppy, what a nice example of a German pilsner. The aroma is a little hoppier than a beer straight from the motherland, but that's by no means a bad thing. The hops are herbal and grassy upfront with mild kicks of lemon and grapefruit. The malt jumps out from behind the hops, with mix of doughy and toasty bread notes. A delicious beer, it reminds me of a more traditional (and more drinkable) version of Victory's Prima Pils. The finish is biting and a little rough, like you'd expect from a healthy helping of Euro hops. I'd have another.","tempest","Dec 24, 2012"

2.36,-40.9,4,3,2,2,2,"Overall, I like this beer. It is a very solid example of American micro pilsener. The bottle says "German-style brew", but there is nothing in Germany even close to this. The ample addition of caramel malts is the first problem, the use of dry hopping the second. The cloying mouthfeel and the aromatic hop oil aftertaste scream American micro. If you like Samuel Adam´s Noble PIls or Victory`s Prima Pils, you will like this one. If you like Bitburger and Warsteiner, you will not.","felsenpils","Nov 03, 2012"

The lacing wasn't much to look at other than a few scattered clumps on the glass. The smell of the beer was of fresh grains and yeast. The taste of the beer is very mild, it's slightly grassy but mostly grainy with a subtle hop spark in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was clean, light bodied, moderately refreshing and dry in the finish. Overall this beer was pretty good for what it is.

The bitterness lingers on the palate and this is a good thing. Wanting more, I drain the bottle and regret the purchase of just one.

The aroma is a burst of spicy, floral hops and bready malt, a perfect marriage of malt and hops...a very welcoming nose. The flavor is sweet, bready malt and spicy hop flavor. The bitterness is moderate and helps to dry the finish slightly, perfectly balancing the sweetness from the malt. A long lasting subtle malt/hop tango lasts on the sides and back of the tongue.

Head is quickly down to a skim of teensy bubbles, with average slow-falling lace. Aroma is minimal, with pale malt sweetness trying to take a stand. Taste starts with the pale malts, goes a touch fruity in the middle, and then closes with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and definitely sedate, and drinkability is not bad either.

4.5,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle. This brew pours a slightly oranged yellow color with a half finger of loosely packed bubbles over top that is maintained by a healthy stream of carbonation through the column of very clear liquid. The aroma is lightly honey-sweet, with a mild and crisp grain character bolstered by the spiceyness of a healthy dose of noble hopping. This one really smells nice with the contrasts between the light sweet and crisp hop and grain. The flavor hits with a grassy hop and moderate bitterness initially. This moves to a more grainy roughness that is polished with the sweetness I associate with pilsner malt. It finishes with a second wave of moderate bitterness that maintains itself on the sides of my tongue and spicey and slightly herbal hop notes. This one seems to be showcasing noble hops, with a bit of the grainy and sweet hop character sandwiched in between. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles. I like the somewhat heavier-than-expected quality of this one, as it really makes me want to slow down a bit while drinking it. I find this brew to be very approachable. The hops are prevalent, but not obtrusive. This is one to sit down and savor on a warm day as a refresher, in my opinion.","kmpitz2","Jun 22, 2007"

Both body and carbonation are probably around medium levels, but very soft and refreshing on the tongue, quenching your thirst, but encouraging you to take another. Excellent beer; I plan on drinking copious amounts of this over the summer. Updated on July 17, 2007. Original smell was 4.5, taste was 5.

Taste is quite complex and very interestingly yummy. Straight up easy and soft bready malts up front, so smooth and soft its just a pleasure to let it touch the tongue. Oh so very nice. A touch of fruitish berries hinting with very light grains of wheat and the hops are so pleasingly balanced in with nice even herbal/grassy notions thats very nice on the palette. Very steady and mellow balance with a super nice finish that is a bit like saltine crackers with a light drying with a dash of bread salts like that of dry pretzels. One excellent taste'n Pils!! Feel is a solid medium body with a small kick in the middle, mellowing smooth, lightly crisp and drying finish with lingering saltish drying that sticks around on the sides of the cheeks.

Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp. The four style of hops that are utilized are really featured in the flavor of this classic German-styled lager. The hop bitterness hits midway across the tongue and remains throughout the finish. As the beer warms a bit, the malt backbone becomes more prominent.
