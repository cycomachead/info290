Fresh biscuity malt and earthy floral hop aromas. Incredibly soft, delicate feel throughout with a light tanginess through the middle. Biscuity malt flavor up front followed by tangy, but gentle spicy hops. Spicy flavors transition to herbal hop flavors toward the end. Finished clean and crisp with a light biscuit malt aftertaste and herbal bitterness on the edges. Super easy drinking.

I wouldn't change a thing about how this beer looks. The smell is mostly spicy Teutonic hops, with a little bit of graininess as well. Tastes great, really comes out and bites with the hops and snaps closed with a dry finish. The hops are a little much - don't get me wrong, I'm loving it, but I expected a little more balance, and the scales are tilted in favor of the hops here. Good, easy drinking mouthfeel on this one, clean as a whistle, but it could be a little livelier. Overall, an absolutely brilliant refresher, just about everything I want out of a German Pils. However, if the hops are going to be so strong for the style, I could do with a little more depth to their character, they're a lot more spicy than floral. A little more maltiness for balance would have been welcome. Really, though, the complaints pale in comparison to the achievements of this astonishingly well crafted and authentic beer.","kc44","Mar 18, 2012"

Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, grass, orange, biscuit, floral, and herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, grass, floral, pepper, bread, light tartness, and herbal hops. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly sticky and crisp mouthfeel. Very drinkable and smooth, with no alcohol in the taste or finish as expected at 5.4%. Overall this is a fantastic pilsner, and definitely one of the best I have had. Very drinkable, and full of nice hoppy flavors with good balance.

Very dry finish with sharp spicy bite. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and sweet honey like mouthfeel.

There is a bit of earthy bitterness there as well. Overall, not terribly complex and doesn't follow through too smoothly. Body is light with higher levels of carbonation, though certainly within the normal range of the style. Mild bitterness in the finish. Drinkability is pretty nice.

Hyper-crisp nose of rye, dark bread, quinine, lemon peel, celery, pepper, very little soft or giving, minimal apricot, peach, apple fruit scent presence. Full-bodied, even kind of heavy for its type, the carbonation churns steadily, if not for this it might paste itself to your tongue. All the tonic water, quinine, lemon peel, sourdough bread, pepper here too, crisp but not exactly refreshing as the weight is too much and there's no real lift off the palate. Pear, apple, peach fruit doled out meagerly. Pretzel salt and bitters finish things up. Stylistically, this does ape the German approach, however, it lacks the finesse and drinkability to be considered top notch.","farrago","Jun 07, 2010"

Delicate, cloud-like bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Noble hops aromas and a hint of skunk. Taste consistent with nose, but I also get a hint of caramel malt in the mix, as well as a little citrus acidity.

This seems a little more "refined" in taste as well, a little sweeter, but only a little bit. Interestingly, the hops seem a little less sharp (more smooth) compared with the other day.

A bit of sharpness hits initially thanks to those German bittering hops, but that folds into the slightly sweet, raw-grain taste that follows. It's a bit on the thin side, even for a pilsner, and it retains its fizziness the whole glass.

I love it when I can find a great example of a German pilsner here in the US made by a US micro. I also love it when an American micro can take a beer like a German pils and make it better. That is what I think Stoudt's has done here. The beer pours a very pale yellow with and ever so slight haze. It's so pale it is almost florescent. But don't let the color fool you. This is no light beer. It is medium to light bodied and full flavored. Aroma is spot on, bursting with grassy noble hops and yeasty bread. Bitterness is higher than the average pils,and that is a great thing. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. This and Prima Pils by Victory are great American pilsner beers.

The palate is a disappointment, though. Sweetness first off, followed by juicy carbonation and then a crash of bitter hops. The aftertaste is sharply bitter -- way too much for a style that should be soft and drinkable. Overall, this was a disappointment for me.

Resinous and this is what lasts on the tongue. In the same flavor profile as Prima Pils... Mouthfeel is light in a pils way--not water--so good in this regard, but it's so carbonated, it's just overkill. Drinkability wise, it's too hoppy to apreciate the other things going on here. I'm saddened by the reoccuring need for beers to be extreme or take a mellow but flavorful style like a pilsner and try and make it what it's not. The name of the good brewing game is balance, and this does not achieve it. But if your a hopehead, this or Prima Pils are the kind of pils you may shoot for as they will blast you with a different style of not-too-malty hop water for your apreciation of all the varieties of hops.

Herbal and dry grass tones spring forth as well. The flavour is very tasteful. It is utterly pleasant and appealing without so much as a challenge to the palate. It has great hop bite. It tends to be dry but wet enough to be greatly refreshing which was exactly what I was looking for in this beer. The mouthfeel is light and tingly. It is superb from a drinkability standpoint.

The clarity proved a showcase of the highly bubbly nature of the beer, which produced a foamy white head that was bigger than typical for a Pils at nearly two fingers thick. The aroma was that of restrained, spicy, noble hops, and the sweet honey like Pilsner malt with just a touch of vegetal DMS. The taste was clean and balanced with sweet malt with a hint of corn just edging out the hops. Due to the lack of bitterness this one wasnt quite flawlessly crisp, but was flavorful enough to overlook the bit of muddiness.

The first actually had a bit of a sour quality, and I thought, please get better soon. Actually, it's still evident 30 minutes later. There are some more pleasant things going on: it is pretty citrusy in the finish. I actually find it bit sweet too.

4.21,7.9,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Although this is lighter than the usual microbrew fare, this is an excellent, flavorful beer. Too good to be called a lawn mower beer, yet it would be an awesome choice after the chores are complete.","smcolw","Jun 04, 2005"
3.82,-2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Lots of carbonation activity going on, but not apparent in the mouthfeel. The smell and taste both have a little more hops than I was expecting. The hops are more of the grapefruit variety than the pine variety. Aftertaste is all grapefruit bitterness. I am drinking this beer at a warmer than normal temp, which I suspect accounts fof the stronger than average hop factor. Enjoyable brew.","thinkbreakfast","May 13, 2005"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear golden color. Lots of tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. Thick white fluffy head, with decent retention. Pale bready malt aroma, grassy, sulfur and slightly skunky. Bready malt flavor, dry on the palate. Nice amount of bitterness. Grassy hop flavor. Light body, crisp, high carbonation. Better than average. Good drinkability. Not exciting, but pretty good.","Bierguy5","May 02, 2005"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I sampled a 12 ounce bottle, poured light straw, with a medium bubble white head, minor lacing observed. Nose is the expected and hoped for grassy saaz hop type stuff. Crisp, cleansing and clean tasting Pilsner. Nice take on the style , well worth enjoying a bottle or two, went nicely with some cheese, crackers and salad.","Billolick","Apr 23, 2005"
3.95,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle. Pours a brilliantly clear pale straw color with an eggshell colored head. Some wafts of grassy hops and some pale malt sweetness in the aroma and a mineral, watery background. Crisp and cleansing on the palate. The way a good German-style Pils (Jever in my book) should be, it has a good balance of bitterness to sweetness. It is very neutral; yet flavorful. A very nice U.S.-brewed version of a Euro-Pils. Fundamental and drinkable.","crookedhalo","Jan 29, 2005"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I had written Stoudt's off, but their new line up and tweaking has produced two great beers. This one and the sublime Double IPA","TinusTime","Jan 25, 2005"
4.5,15.4,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Brilliant yellow under a drift of fat-bubbled foam. Aromas of citrus drizzled scones and wet matchsticks. So easy and soft this beer, a gorgeous mingling of toast lightly lathered with apricot jam and river stones. I could drink this all day then crack one at sundown to celebrate my day of drinking. A fine American Pils that should be available everywhere. Like iron filings to my electromagnetic lips.","inebrius","Jan 19, 2005"
3.92,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Flavor is balanced and assertive--slighty sweet malty notes work in harmony with a tangy citrus hop flavor, and a hop finish that's sharp but not big. Mouthfeel is thin and refreshing. The hopping is more likely to make you think of California beers than the Budweis, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. A nice summer refresher.","sparkydoyle","Dec 08, 2004"
4.1,5.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing at the start. The finish was clean and crisp. This is extremely drinkable as the flavor and refreshing crisp quality makes your tastebuds very happy.","Gavage","Oct 25, 2004"
3.75,-3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Mild spicy hop aroma. Foamy, brilliant white colored head fed by dozens of streams of medium sized bubbles. A few strings of lace sit atop the clear, pale yellow colored beer. Light malt flavor is quickly overtaken by a solid bitter bite. A light sweetness makes its way in towards the end cutting the bitterness before all the flavor fades fast in the fairly dry finish. Light bodies beer, easy drinking, the bitterness goes away after a 1/4 beer or so.","HappyHourHero","Sep 28, 2004"
3.74,-4.1,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Good, medium, soft carbonation. I liked the hop presence alot in this pils. A well-made version of a standard.","donnebaby","Sep 26, 2004"
3.83,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottle label is different then the picture currently on the BA website.it now has a painted picture of the Stoudts Brewing Company with hops and barley around it. BB date stamp is smeared on the bottle but starts w/ 11/17/ probably 04 because I think they just started putting these is bottles somewhat recently. Appearance: Pours a pale golden color, slightly hazed body and the head is bright white in color Aroma: Nice noble halletau hops and a crisp pale malt aromas. Taste: Very good German style pilsener with floral and herbal hops and there is a very light biscuity malt presence that bring a nice sweetnessvery refreshing pils. Very crisp and refreshing offering by Stoudts.","WilliamPhilaPa","Sep 18, 2004"
3.82,-2.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a clean pale malt and Czech hop scent. It is a bit grainy, but good. The taste is good. It has a grainy pale malt flavor with excellent hop notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine pilsner. It's simple in it's approach, but it has all the elements of a quality brew.","WesWes","Aug 23, 2004"
3.65,-6.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The aroma was surprisingly hoppy - fresh cut alfalfa - a surprising hop characteristic from a pils, but definitely welcome. The taste followed with the same dominant green hop flavor, but didn't prevent the clean and crisp pils malt flavor from reaching the palate. It had a great taste, but the accumulation of bitterness was somewhat significant. Maybe a bit too much hop?","freed","Jul 28, 2004"
4.18,7.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Final Thought: These beers still taste much better on tap, but the bottled beer still tastes great! Complements to Ed Stoudt...","mobyfann","Jul 20, 2004"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Pale golden slightly hazed body paired with bright white nice sized head dwindles slowly leaving specks of lacing. Aroma: Nice noble hop bouquet Tettanag and Halletau paired with a crisp pale malt sweetness very nice biscuit malt presence to note as well. Taste: Very good German style pils floral and herbal hops with the slight biscuit toned malts blend into one insanely refreshing pils. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied crisp mouthfeel carbonation was a bit high but didn't hurt drinkability. Drinkability: Nice easy going flavorful lager pairs nicely with food glad to see Stoudt's finally deliver this offering in bottles.","WVbeergeek","Jul 15, 2004"
3.89,-0.3,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from the pint bottle a clear golden with light white head that settled down to a nice little ring. (bought from Stoudts) Scents of champagne, white grapes, maybe a little honey... very nice. Lots of carbination hits your tongue right away with a slight bite. Very light moutfeel, very thin but not watery. Slight citrus, little bit of grapefruit, chardonnay... Decent beer, little light for me though.Very drinkable.","shapudding","Jun 18, 2004"
3.02,-22.6,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,"I really wanted to love this beer. Great pilsners are tough to make and therefore quite rare on the micro scene. IMHO, this one started off good but quickly showed it's flaws.","yen157","Feb 15, 2004"
3.85,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This pils poured a clear, golden-yellow color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass a little. The smell was modest but clean with a faint aroma of malt. The taste was malty and floral with some grain flavors. The hop bitterness was low. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation feel. The flavor (both malt and floral hops) lingered nicely. This was a nice, lighter bodied pils.","UncleJimbo","Oct 24, 2003"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Straw yellow colored with a slight protein haze in the pint glass. Frothy white thick lasting head. Not much nose just a little clean malt in the sinus. Crisp tangy flavor dominates the mouth. Crisp solid hop presence. There is also some lingering sweetness to the finish. Quite lite and drinkable... a beer you could easily have a few of... gret with food.","frank4sail","Sep 29, 2003"
4.43,13.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"The flavor is well-balanced between a semi-rich maltiness and lush hop flavors; and it's distinctly bitter but not overwhelming. It finishes dry and refreshing with some short-lingering malt and gently bitter hops. Crisp, clean,and full of flavor - this is one well-brewed and highly drinkable German-style pils!","NeroFiddled","Jul 23, 2003"
3.98,2.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured crystal clear and well carbonated. It was the color of hay that glistened in the sun. It produced a fluffy cloud like head that was pure white in color and thick, full and sticky. The lace that was produced was the same color and very plentiful, sticky and lasted to ¾ glass. The aromas were mostly of 2 kinds of hops: Czechoslovakian and Saaz. These hops produced a light fruit and flowery aroma all through out the bottle and glass, but as it warmed, a hint of sweet malt did rise and become noticeable. The tastes were very much like the aroma: Czechoslovakian and Saaz hops ruled, but other flavors did arise. Light tastes of grass, malt, grains and spice also were noticeable. It finished with a dry hop flower taste on the tongue that was noticeable even when I exhaled. It was light bodied. A fairly dry beer that was crisp and clean. Not overly hoped but enough to satisfy. Good balance of flavors to represent the style. Quenched my thirst and satisfied me.","Jarod","Jul 17, 2003"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The Pils pours a brassy gold with a fine white head, choice Saaz hop aroma blowing off it like clouds on a mountian. Brisk, almost fruity, softly malty, evenly hoppy, but at no place overwhelming, this is all-day beer. The only place the hops show their edge is in the long, relentless finish that is a moderate, pleasant bitterness. Quite soft and unassuming up front, it gains interest as it goes in classic Bohemian pils style, like a stream down a mountain.","stoutman","Feb 19, 2003"
4.33,11,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Classic yellow gold, fluffy two-finger head, excellent lacing. Lots of fresh hay/grass in nose. Taste is crisp, hoppy. A sturdy malt backbone behind a wall of hops, with a slight lemon twang. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full. Nice mild hoppy aftertaste. A solid pils, refreshing not only in summer, but anytime.","RonfromJersey","Sep 23, 2002"
3.93,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Light straw in color. Lazy floating bubbles with moderate head and lace. Light in aroma, but some trases of floral hops.  Taste is smooth and tangy with ample hop flavor. Malt makes a slight secondary appearance. Rich and flavorful and easy drinking on a hot summer evening.","psugrad98","Aug 11, 2002"
