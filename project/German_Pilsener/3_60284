3.56,-3.8,4.25,3.75,3.5,3,3.5,"A solid, fruity, fairly crisp pilsner that hides is high-abv very well, this Save Our Shore is a solid euro-pils with maybe a bit too much textural weight but decent head, excellent retention, and some cool lacing patterns in my frosted Abita shaker-pint.  The hopping is mild, but nicely accentuates the yeast-malt fruitiness that resounds through this beer's flavor-profile; however I would've liked more effervescence to carry this pilsner home.  It's a fun effort—and a good cause, charitably-speaking—but it's solidly unspectacular, unfortunately.  I'm normally a big fan of high-abv pilsners, but this doesn't quite hit the snuff.","OrestesMethuon","Jan 15, 2015"

Aroma is both malty and hoppy with the malt winning the battle. Moderate carbonation. Taste is more malt sweetness than hops but they are both there and living in harmony. Ever so slight alcohol burn. Beer seems to have lost a little of its boldness, though. I am drinking it just 8 days before the best by date. Overall, decent pilsener, nothing incredible...","hophugger","Jan 14, 2015"

Flavor is weak grainy and sort of bland with just enough hops to balance. Mouthfeel is ok. Overall I'm confused as to what I was served. The server at O'Charleys in Monroe told me it was like a Blue Moon but with lemon instead of orange. It was served with a lemon wedge. Kind of tastes like a wit and a weak American all malt lager.

Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, bread, cracker, wheat, light banana, pepper, clove, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, pepper, light banana, clove, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, wheat, banana, cracker, bread, clove, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pilsner style. All around well balanced malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice golden yellow in the glass with a near pure white head that retreats to a layer of small bubbles. The smell is of sweet malt and bread with a bit of spicy hop character in the background, a touch of fruity ester comes through as well. The taste follows the smell with a base of clean and slightly sweet pale malt. The hops are restrained but definitely present with great noble hop spice and grassy flavors. The carbonation is somewhat low to moderate and the finish of this beer is almost very clean leaving just a bit of sticky hop flavor and malt. Overall this isnt a world class german pilsner but it is a pretty good american made example of the style and the cause benefited by sales of this beer make it well worth it.","fank2788","Aug 09, 2012"

There are a lot of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of sweet malt and hops. It's such a bright earthy smell. The taste is sweet from the malts and is balanced by the hop bitterness. There's some citrus flavor from the hops, which helps cut with the bitterness and sweetness to produce an excellently balanced beer. The alcohol does not come through in the taste, but you will notice the effect as you continue to drink the beer. The flavors only get better as the beer warms. The beer is medium bodied with a creamy, yet crisp mouthfeel. The crispness comes from the abundant carbonation. This is very easy to gulp.

3.34,-9.7,4.5,3,3,4.5,3.5,"Looks similar in color to Andygator (golden honey) but this one has a two finger fluffy foamy head that stuck around for more than a minute and left behind some pretty nice lacing, body is light and carbonation is at exactly the right sort of effervescent level for a pilsener. Smells mostly lemony but also medium pale malt scent is there, flavor is not nearly as heavy on the hop spicing as I had anticipated. (I originally thought it would be a Czech-style until I did my homework) but it works as a German Pilsener that depends almost entirely on floral and earth toned hopping. I'm not picking up on any of the subtle fruit tones mentioned by other BAs, however. So I'm left with a really pretty beer that has a really great mouthfeel and very simplistic and clean flavors and aromas.","WastingFreetime","Oct 26, 2011"

Nothing really stood out on this brew with the exception of the floral note I picked up on. The rest of the brew was kind of weak in flavor in my opinion as nothing really jumped out at me.

I was not sneezing, so it was agreeable. Mouthfeel was medium with a riot of tastes on the tongue. Initially, I caught a peppery spiciness, then some grassy notes, followed by a biscuit flavor. The finish was very dry, very peppery, very refreshing. Strike two for The Woodman on this day, opening beers MUCH better suited for warmer (read "hot") weather.

Nice golden wheat color with a ample, frothy white head that leaves soapy lacing down the sides of the glass. Honestly, this is a top notch pilsner in terms of appearance. Quite a looker. Taking a big whiff right after pouring it gives a impression of sweet fruits, ripe pears and sweet Fuji apples. Just a bit of sweet caramel and yeasty bread. Just a hint of spice/grass from the hops but nothing over powering. The flavor is just a little off. There is a generic sweetness that just a bit off putting. Almost a cream corn, minus the corn. Still get over ripe pears with just a little bit of bread. Slight grassy hops come through at the very tail. Honestly, with most pilsners, I just really want them to be clean and crisp, and this throwing a 18 instead of a bullseye. Still a good score but not quite what you needed. The mouthfeel is honestly the one thing that really irks me. It just finished to sweet and full. I want lighter styles to finished dry like sandpaper. This just misses the dart board.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The palate is surprisingly muted. I think the Florida heat wasn't particularly kind to this beer, there's a mild hop character up front with a blend of orange, lemon peel and earth. This is actually pretty delicate, I'm reminded of the complexity of orange blossom honey (minus the sweetness, obviously). The grain character is rather rustic here, there's a blend of wheat and raw pilsner-like character here. A little sweetness is present in the mid-palate, but the finish does dry up, leaving a rather excellent and delicate hop character. A little earth, a little orange peel (curacao?) and a little sweetness are all rather expertly in balance here. The use of the wheat malt has lent a little heft to the palate. Carbonation is light, enhancing the softness that the dextrinous wheat character that's present. A wisp of alcohol appears on occasion, but all told, this is a pretty solid beer.

3.98,7.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Found this at Brix in Omaha. Great looking painted bomber. Pilsners aren't usually my thing but I figured that, considering the cause, I could give this one a go. Hats off to Abita, who came up with this idea. This is a 22 ounce bomber. I'm pouring it into a big ass pilsner glass. Pours with a two inch huge, billowing, frothy head. The head leaves behind some serious lacing. Gigantic bubbles and foam from this one. Likewise carbonation is huge, with fizz seemingly going on for days. Pours cloudy, which isn't surprising considering this is an unfiltered beer. Color is a bright gold, brilliant like the sun. Aroma is pretty hefty, especially for a pilsner, with cereal notes and lemongrass in the nose. Pretty solid amount of bitterness in this one - it's pleasant though. Lively mouthfeel with a high amount of pleasant carbonation and a pretty slick mouthfeel. Taste is spot on. Light malt starts, before giving way to grassy and fruity hop character. Bitterness teases the palate before giving way to a sweet honey finish. The biscuity malt sweetness really helps to hide the 7% ABV, which I can't seem to really find. Really crisp and refreshing take on the pilsner style. Kudos to Abita for supporting a good cause by putting together a great beer.","eclaycamp","Oct 08, 2010"

The aroma is of grassy/spicy hops, perhaps some citrus. Nice pleasant aroma. The taste is of a light malt, slightly fruity with a grassy and limey hop flavor, not dry like most pils. Its different but does take on a pilsner character. The feel is light with tingly carbonation, not very crisp but easily drinkable and refreshing. This is a very solid beer, nice hop flavor. I would drink it again.","Gmann","Oct 05, 2010"

3.71,0.3,4.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"When I saw this one come into the store I was happy to pick one up since some proceeds were going to a good cause. Pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color with a large white head that fell slowly leaving behind a patchwork of lace. Aroma is very simple and straightforward. Mostly pale grains in the nose, a touch of wheat in there which gives it a slight twang, and herbal, grassy hops. Taste is very similar. I'm picking up on lot of citrusy hop notes but it's not bitter in anyway. There's some orange, lemon, and a touch of grass, but overall the hops are very well balanced with the pale malts that make this beer very drinkable and enjoyable for such a high ABV. Body is medium, but could use a touch more carbonation to add soome crispness. Overall, a good beer for a very worthy cause.","KeefD","Oct 03, 2010"

Enjoyable enough pilsner, but it lacks the snap and crispness of the higher rated brews of the style. More grassyness, more pleasant lager sensibilities. Smooth in the mouth from start to moderately long finish. Decent beer for a good cause.
