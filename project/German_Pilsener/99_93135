4,10.5,,,,,,"An interesting beer, no doubt: "The first to use the Belma hops, discovered growing wild on a farm in the Yakima Vallley". It's slightly hazy in the glass, perhaps from dry-hopping, and topped by a fluffy head of bright white. The head retention is quite good, as is the lacing left behind. In the nose it's a touch minty, softly grassy, delicately floral, and subtly fruity (apple) over a straightforward, grainy, golden malt base. The same hop components remain in the flavor with the almost spearmint like minty-ness stepping forward. It's not very bitter and therefore the malt seems quite solid and somewhat sweetish, yet it remains balanced overall. However, the two components don't really seem to mesh well. The hops appear, backed by the malt, and it pretty much stays that way until the swallow where the bitterness comes up a bit, as do the more grassy flavors of the hops. On the other hand, a little less malt would leave the beer lacking overall. It remains interesting, enjoyable, and refreshing. Worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 03, 2014"

3.75,3.6,,,,,,"I just love the sound  of a good Crack! in the morning. Leave it to Saranac to brighten the day with something wild. I celebrated with an inverted Glug and then sat back and watched the pseudo-cascade. It developed into two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with great retention. Color was solid-Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity. Of course, this acted as the clarion call for Midas, Mammon and Croesus to show up and begin squabbling amongst themselves for a taste. I CAN hardly put up with it any more. Nose had an earthy, peppery bite and I was inspired to ask my neighbor to plant peppers next year. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was very earthy, like something freshly harvested. Wet-hopped, perhaps? It also had a cereal-like maltiness, so I would put it as a German-style Pils. Finish was crisp and dry and would make an excellent addition to the cooler on a hot, humid Summer’s day.","woodychandler","Aug 27, 2014"

A little too much caramel breadiness in the flavor upfront (for a pilsner), but the strawberry, citrus, and melon quickly blends in, resulting in a fairly unique pale lager. It actually results in something closer to a Vienna lager with a hoppy twist. Light, but not without a certain creaminess before finishing crisp.

A great summer beer that isn;t gimmicky. Extremely sessionable, yet still packs a lot of great flavor. I hope Saranac will someday distribute this in 6'ers or 12'ers, as I've never seen them before. Highly recommend this beer for any fans of quality, flavorful lagers and/or pilseners.","stella77artois","Jun 26, 2013"

Appearance: nice golden body; white head is crisp, thick and foamy--tantalizing... Aroma: prime,, pleasant fragrance of softened hops; citrus and a bit of musky malt makes for an intriguing, antagonistic pair... Palate: a rounded mouthfeel, unexpected in a pilsner; definitely profiles as a thicker,, grainier version... Taste: a taut ping that resounds, then a malty base of hops keeps this less dense and less "wild" than expected; heavier aftertaste as well doesn't endear... Overall: a bit warming as the glass drains; a different experience when arranged with others of the same style....overall, a compliment to Saranac that it is a unique product by their standards....","dacrza1","Jun 25, 2013"

3.79,4.7,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"brewed with the newly discovered belma hops, I like this pilsener that has a lot more hop flavor than most of these do. its got an enticing pale yellow color, but the head falls down a bit, struggles to maintain itself. the nose is hoppy for the style, lots of darker fruits amongst the mold bitterness, and very unique complexion. the pilsener malts appear german to me, light and dusty, with that cornbread sort of sweetness, but much more delicate. the flavor is just like the nose, with the hops actually taking a bit of a back seat to the grains, although the hops are very interesting and new to my palate. I get an almost blackberry flavor in the finish, u really like this in the summer mix. ultra light in body, and impressively clean in the finish, but still bringing a lot of flavor. this is really nice in the summer, a beer I will happily return to when it is around. maybe the surprise of this years beers of summer.","StonedTrippin","Jun 15, 2013"

Roasty and sweet aftertaste, with a dry feel at the end. Great clinging lace as you drink. The beer is kept light and frothy by the carbonation. Clean and effervescent finish.
