I smell classic german pils malts, light and clean, refreshing for sure, with all kinds of citrus in both lemon and hops. a uniquely refreshing taste, hopped better than most, but still malt forward and nicely balanced. I have always admired the bigger beers from troegs, but this one proves they can cover the spectrum. this is a great summer beer, a good potential segue into craft for those who don't already drink it. fizzy carbonation and a clean finish, I could session this stuff all summer. fantastic when ice cold, not as much when it warms up, so slug it down.","StonedTrippin","Jul 14, 2013"

Similar taste, pils malts, fairly sweet, mild hops for a bit of balanced, corny grains. Just really not my thing, but still pretty typical for the style all around.

No, it won't win awards for complexity or depth, but when you're washing down some delicious "steamed crab" chicken wings, I can't think of a better beer for the task.

Taste of big lemon, pepper, light citrus peel, bread, cracker, grass, herbal, floral, and earthy spices. Nice amount of peppery spices on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, grass, bread, pepper, floral, and earthy spices on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish as expected; with some lingering hop flavors. Very pleasantly balanced with a nice amount of hop flavor. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel. No alcohol presence at all other than a light warming after the finish.

The body is a clear straw yellow but from the name I'd been expecting a bright glow and really it looks like any BMC pilsner. It smells of grass and malt. The taste mirrors the smell and is fairly standard pilsner with the exception there's a stronger bitter hops finish. Marginally above the BMCs.","MoreThanWine","Jun 04, 2012"

4.59,23.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: An outstanding representation of the style. In fact, I'd argue a better representation than the overly-hopped and infinitely popular Prima Pils. Too bad this is just a summer seasonal.","JednoPivoProsim","Aug 28, 2011"
3.67,-1.6,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Thin bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that provides a decent amount of bitterness without overpowering the other flavors. Earthy with hints of grass, straw and pine. This is countered by subtle citrus notes from the hops as well as sme light fruit, especially apple and pear. A bit watered down but still well balanced and easy to drink, especially during these warmer months.","corby112","Aug 27, 2011"
3.65,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Sort of a lightened version of the Prima. Less complex and way cleaner & lighter malts. Hops are dialed back, but still firmly bitter with lots of character.

4.13,10.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours an orangey yellow with a nice cap of white head on top into my Lost Abbey stem. Looks fantastic with its clarity and, in general, looks very inviting. The nose is just a touch of hops, a touch of grain and a touch of sweetness. More out of the nose for the style than what I have had. Nice. The taste is really great. It's like growing up having crappy food (BMC brews) of a certain style then trying some chef's reinvention of it (this). Lightly sweet in the finish, super clean and balanced, this beer goes down crazy easy. This was more balanced (less sweet) than Mama's Little Yella Pils. I could have a 6'er at the beach no problem. Yum. Nice medium light carbonation and a light, but not extremely light body. Give this one a whirl.","seeswo","Aug 17, 2011"

Poured into a pilsener glass with a sturdy white foam that left sticky lacings down the glass. Biscuiy malt and floral hop aromas with a hint of lemon. Medium bodied with a smooth, mellow feel. Biscuity malt flavor up front that quickly leads to floral hop flavors that balance nicely with the breadiness. Finishes smooth and clean with some floral hoppy bitterness. Very pleasant and refreshing. If only all pilseners were this good.","IronLover","Jul 30, 2011"

Pours a good clean clear yellow with about an inch of big fluffy white head. Lots of visible carbonation and great head retention. Interesting nose on this one. Typical pilsner smell with hints of lemon, grass and floral notes. Slight scent of grassy hops. Right away I get a bit of lemon flavor. This is really crisp. Pilsner malts follow shortly after with a good hop finish. This actually kind of has a bit of a sour forefront to me. I'm absolutely loving the lemon flavor. This has really nice carbonation and the body is really light and refreshing. I could really kick the crap out of summer heat with this highly drinkable beer.","Bendurgin","Jul 10, 2010"

But the crispness of the hops was a bit too much for me, and I barely got the other taste hints. What I did get was a little bit of citrus, but it wasn't very helpful to the taste.

This guy pours a sallow color so clear Windex probably wants to contact Troegs for pointers. Seriously. This is capped by a tall, thick forest of white froth, which leaves some decent lacing behind as a death rattle. The smell is characteristically light, with notes of light lemon, wheat, and some hoppy citrus/florals. The taste is mostly a watery mixture of floral hoppy bitters, though some wheat-y citrus lies buried in the brewer's sands of time (industry secret, yo). The body is quite light, with a light carbonation and a refreshing finish. I could see drinking this after laboring beneath a ravaging sun (though I wouldn't know: my domain is currently chilled by a perpetually-running air-conditioner) and being rather refreshed. I think it's time we ditched that worthless, bland water shit...what's it good fer, anyway?","TMoney2591","Jun 10, 2010"

Poured to a nice golden color with a good-sized white head that stuck around for a good while leaving some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma, at least to me, seems to be a little more in the face than other Pils that I have tried. Lemony hops are there and I notice that first but then the Saaz hop spice aroma. Slight grain aroma there, seems sweet, but it goes well with the hops I am picking up. The flavors are also quite refreshing with a sweet malty flavor taking my first notice. Hops break in and seem to add more of a lemon zest that sticks around in your mouth. Nice brew, not a favorite style but based on what I have had in the past this is very good.

Taste is a nice mix of snappy hops, and biscuit like malt. A little more carbonation might help the drinkability here, but it still comes across as a very sessionable lager.

The Saaz and Mittelfrau that they use certainly bring a dry, bitter spiciness, and some floral notes. Overall, it's nothing really special, but it's very much to style and a joy to drink.

In the flavor, the malts come out more than in the smell and forms a wonderful balance with the jasmine tea presence of the hops. Does not have as much hop sting as, say, Prima Pils, but I rather like that about this one. Finishes dry and assertively bitter.

A quite refreshing flavor and feel.

Lacking in most characteristics that I expect in a pilsener. Overly dry without any kind of complexity or intermixing of malt/hop flavors. Just one unified, boiled down flavor. A bit waxy in mouth as well, making it difficult to enjoy.

I found it to be crisp with a nice hoppyness and bit of that grass and citrus that I noticed in the aroma. A very slight bitter but welcome aftertaste follows but doesn't last for long. The mouthfeel was a little heavier than I would have guessed it to be based on the appearance again, yet still pretty light and the carbonation was just right. As far a drinkability this beer does what I think it should. I found it to be very easy to drink and quite quenching. This is a beer I will buy again.

The excellent taste consisted of slightly bitter floral hop flavor that added a spiciness, and a subdued lemon flavor contributed to the crisp and refreshing taste. The great taste is assisted by a lighter/medium body just right for the style. Active carbonation felt good on the tongue, too. Excellent drinkability; a great "anytime" beer for me. It's too bad Troegs only offers this in the summer months - I'd gladly keep this one handy in the fridge year-round.","SchmichaelJ","Aug 03, 2004"

4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This pours out a slightly cloudy golden yellow color with an inch of white foam sitting atop. Scant lacing is left around the glass each time this one is sipped. Fresh grassy and citric hops come forth in the aroma with a strong bready malt backbone, a very clean smelling brew. There is a bit of spice to it as well. The taste start off with a malt flavor before giving way to a crisp slightly bitter citric hop flavor on the backside. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation and this has excellent drinkability. I could drink these all day very good taste and very refreshing, another great brew from Troegs.","meathookjones","Jul 06, 2004"
4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2" of white head over the clear light straw brew. Almost seems to glow yellow. Dense head, laces well. Aroma is balanced of pale malts and crisp hops, tending towards the pales slightly. Taste is well-balanced, with strong pale malts flavors, but more hops than most pilsener-styles. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. A nice pilsner-style interpretation.","ppoitras","Jun 26, 2004"
4.26,14.2,4,3,4.5,5,5,"Poured a thick mountain of white head which eventually settled into a nicely thick covering. Lightly scented, crisp and clean, slight citrus and hay. Incredibly smooth tasting with just enough of a bite to be noticable. Hint of raspberry in there -but not fruity, just a reminder in the background that kinda gets your attention. Light and refreshing, very drinkable. Nice!","shapudding","Jun 14, 2004"

Smells of light malt with lemons and a touch of grass thrown in with a and nice citrus hop aroma. Tastes light crisp lemon citrus flavored malt with a grainy grassy flavor. Hops leaves nice light coating in your mouth so you know you have had a beer. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing as it should be. Drinakability is is great could go threw a sixer in no time. Was debating even getting this beer do all the bad mass produced pilsner I have had in the past. Makes me wonder if Bud actually put hops in their beer it might not be too bad?","mntlover","Jun 07, 2004"

4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It's a hopy, tasty pilsner that goes down damned smooth and crushes thirst in its path. All kinds of fun and refreshing, it's a cool combination, balancing lots to like. These go down so nice, one after another, making it not only drinkable, but stridently satisfying. Whether slow sipping or a summertime session, this is truly one to have when you're having more than one, with all due apologies to Schaefer!","Foxman","Beers"

4.22,13.1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Although this beer doesn't reach the stratospheric heights of Victory's Prima Pils, I won't hold that against it since I consider Prima the absolute pinnacle for the style. Sunshine Pils is still light years ahead of most of its competition though and I'd love to have regular access, especially during summertime.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 25, 2004"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours and oh so pale clear golden color. Thin white head. Smell is a nice malty sweetness with more than a little hoppy aroma. Nice citrusy smell is also noticeable. Taste is just a flat out nice pils taste. There are more than a little bit of hops noticeable. This is a crisp, clean beer that isn't too heavy and isn't so over the top that a macro drinker wouldn't like this one. Wonderfully done, and a superb beer for the summer. Nicely done, Troegs!","JackTheRipper","Apr 25, 2004"
4.15,11.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Not very bitter, in fact I had expected just a bit more of a hop bite from this pilsener. No matter, it is crisp and tastes of light grassy malt. Better malt profile than you would expect. Grapefruit and lightly fruity in the finish. Not too fizzy. Well balanced. A great job on a style that is pretty easy to screw up.","ViveLaChouffe","Apr 23, 2004"
4.45,19.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Appearance: Crystal clear golden pale note with a bright white frothy head leaves big sporadic chunks of lacing behind with each sip. Aroma: Grassy hop presence with a zesty Saaz bite to it when you get down to it very citrusy in nature nice hops semi sweet pale malts barely peek through which is a good thing. Taste: Classic hoppy pils here starts out with the citrus, grassy, and pepper notes of the hops finishes softly and a bit dry with the pale biscuit malt sweetness. Perfect blend of flavors but the hops quench my hophead desires, good stuff. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied brew with a nice fuller carbonation typical of the style, dead on this beer has character. Drinkability: Lawnmower beer all the way may just pick up a case when I get situated in my apartments this summer.","WVbeergeek","Apr 23, 2004"
4.4,18,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Well, Troegs comes through yet again! As far as pilsners go, this is one that's up there with Penn, Kaiser and Prima. Light and refreshing, yet still solid, and this is one I'll likely be having again.","beergeek279","Apr 21, 2004"
4.35,16.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"troegs does it again with another quality brew. this time, they took a style i'm not so fond of and made it quite enjoyable. this one pours a nice crisp golden colour. looks nice and refreshing and has a decent sized head for a pilsner. better looking than most pilsners but nothing spectacular overall. the smell is quite nice. it's sweet and hoppy with some wheat notes. very summery. the flavour here is really incredible for a pilsner. i recently really enjoyed rogue's 12th street pilsner, but i think this one passes it in terms of flavour and being my favourite pilsner thusfar (the rogue 12th st is still damn good though). the taste here is much like the smell, sweet and hoppy, with a slight juiciness that seems to be a part of the troegs flavour, as i notice it in many of their brews. while this one strays from the traditional pilsner style a bit (much like the 12th street), it's for the better as this one is basic but complex, and just enjoyable and smooth. a great summer brew.","SixpointJMH","Apr 15, 2004"
4.42,18.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Hands-down the best pilsner I have ever had. I think this beer is amazing. The gold color is quite deceiving. This ain't your average pilsner. The citrus aroma is amazing. The head is thin but lasts throughout the beer. The taste is full of citrus and it is hard to believe that you are actually drinking a pilsner. This beer has a great malt character to balance the unique hop blend. Although this pils has a light and refreshing quality, it is not light. There is a lot in this beer. I find myself being amazed by the quality of this pilsner. It is quite popular with people of varying tastes and preferences. Well done, Troegs!","Maestro","Feb 10, 2004"
4.52,21.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Picked up a 1/6 keg of this today. Pours a beautiful sunny gold color with a thick powdery white head and heavy lacing down the glass. The carbonation level is PERFECT and the smell is of fruit punch, sweet malt, grassy and earthy with just a slight touch of bitter hop bite. The taste is more of the same, clean strong mellow malt backbone with smooth and silky mouthfeel with a nice crisp aftertaste. This is unbelievably drinkable... this is on my list as a top 5 Pilsner and a welcome taste after a few too many Imperial Pils over the last few weeks. I could drink this anytime, anywhere morning, noon or night --- I'll try not to though. Will this be a seasonal that turns into a full time brew for Troeg's.... God I hope so!","Gasp100","Dec 01, 2003"
4.24,13.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"There is a slight smooth mouthfeel with some crispness at the end. There is a subtle spicy bite during the finish. The malt lasts on the tongue for several seconds after swallowing. Extremely drinkable and refreshing.","Gavage","Aug 21, 2003"
4.01,7.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I noticed on their website this beer is only available through August.

4,7.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Had a soft but almost thicker than water mouthfeel, needs to be thinner me think. Nice but a bit too drying and roasty - it spent a little too much time in the sunshine.","nomad","Jul 17, 2003"
4.16,11.5,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Rich golden color, striking clarity, and a white head that just won't quit make this an awesome looking beer. I poured this beer, walked upstairs, turned on the PC, checked the email, read some forum stuff and then looked back at the beer; still sports a 1/4" head that must be buoyed by the very fine trails of carbonation rising through the glass. A very heavy sheet of foam is left clinging to the glass. Light peppery aroma reminds me of Pilsner Urqell, except with a hint of malt sweetness instead of a hint of skunk. The taste is light and crisp, just a little sweetness up front, then finishing pretty clean with just a touch of bitterness. Then the peppery hop notes show in the aftertaste, where a bit of bitterness creeps in and lingers as well. Mouthfeel is full and slightly creamy, as it expands on the tongue. Drinkability is very good as well. This is a good summer quencher and would go great with grilled meats. Another solid beer from Troegs.","aaronh","Jul 02, 2003"
4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Troegs increased distribution in NJ has made this more readily available, and it apparently works wonders for this beer. A much larger, longer lasting frothy white head. Much less carbonation. And most importantly, the metallic aftertaste is no where to be found. Find it fresh and enjoy.","RonfromJersey","May 23, 2003"
3.98,6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This pours with a fine looking creamy white head that leaves a nice lacing as it subsides on top of clear deep yellow/straw colored nectar. The nose is very delicate and a bit sweet with grassy/lemony tones and a touch of flowery hoppiness as well. The taste is on the heavy end of the light-bodied spectrum, but not without substantial flavor. Notes of toast, spiciness and some grassiness mixes with maltiness, then a great hoppiness takes over, flowery and fresh. Nice bitterness level lets you know this is a great Pilsner you are quaffing. Finshes with some good hoppy dryness that fades out long and luscious...one of the best American Pils interpretations I've had yet.","beerluvr","May 09, 2003"
4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very bright and golden yellowish color (almost like sunshine!). Sweet grainy malt aroma with some nice grassy hopiness. The taste is very clean and crisp. There are some fruity esters detected here, along with some buttery notes. Bitterness is right on for a pilsner. Finishes pretty clean and the beer is a nice and drinkable pilsner.","pezoids","May 03, 2003"
4.27,14.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A slightly hazy, but brilliantly yellow body is topped by an exceptionally creamy bright-white head that holds well, maintains a thin and creamy surface covering throughout the glass, and leaves some very nice lace. Very tiny bubbles rise quickly to the surface from all over the bottom of the glass; adding to its appearance. Very nice! The bouquet is quite floral with grassy, lightly citrusy (lemony), and mildly spicy hops (Saaz?) over sweet grainy malt. It's clean and fresh like the morning air after a spring shower. The body is light/medium; and it's delicately effervescent carbonation caresses the tongue. In the flavor, hops ride atop a wave of clean sweet malt that's very well-balanced by a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with a lingering note of lemony hop and sweet malt in the front of the mouth, and a dusty bitterness at the back of the throat. Really refreshing, but interesting as well. Exceptionally well done and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Apr 20, 2003"
3,-19.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Crisp with sharp carbonation at the start. Lots of spicy hops with a touch of malt graininess. The flavor of this beer is way too laid back. It needs more malt sweetness, and it does not balance very well at all. A decent drinker for the summer, but it won't be in my fridge.","ElGuapo","Mar 31, 2003"
4.3,15.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a clear yellow straw color that when viewed from the side you could see all the carbonation bubbles dancing around. The head that was produced was of a white cloud - fluffy and soft. It had some decent staying power that left behind a nice lace that stretched down the glass. The aromas were of hops - floral and bitter - these were the main aromas that came from the glass, also noticable were fresh flowers, citrus fruit - grapefruit, lemons, fresh grass and a semi sweet feel to it. The flavors that came from the glass were mainly hops. This is a good thing since it is a summer refresher beer. Also tasted were lemons, cirtus fruit, spices, fresh cut grass and some carbonation. The beer left an aftertaste of dry hops. Fairly crisp and clean. It is a good thirst quenching beer for the warmer days that come ahead.","Jarod","Aug 20, 2002"

4.35,16.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Looks like I'm in slight disagreement with the earlier reviewers, because I rather like this beer! I must admit I am quite impressed with this brewery in general. They're not going to knock your socks off with new and experimental beers, but they seem to take great care in making a good, consistent, quality product. The Sunshine Pils is no exception. Deep yellow in appearance, white fluffy head that fades to a wispy rim but doesn't completely disappear. Aromas of grass and hay with just a hint of honey sweetness. Taste also has some grass and hay, giving to a slight bitterness, then a creamy sweet finish. Really rather nice, IMO, and a very pleasant beer to drink on a hot summer day.","mophie","Jul 23, 2002"
3.92,5.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a pale straw color with a decent white head that dies too fast and doesn't leave a lace.  Grassy hops with some slight spice to them and a bit of corn/malt sweetness in the nose.  Slightly spicy hope presence throughout the brew, a little more grassy/hayish than spicy.  Some slight notes of DMS in the middle before the hops fade into a somewhat sweet finish.  The brew is fairly refreshing but a little bit sticky on the tongue which takes away from it.  Still a rather drinkable brew that would be a pretty good session brew for hot summer nights drinking with your macro loving friends.  Probably a good conversion beer.","Murph","Beers"

On the palate good hoppiness, grassy and slight fruity citrus notes. Crisp and clean with a bitter finish. Overall a bit boring, becuase it's a Pils but as far as Pils go this is very good. I've always loved Troegs for their consistent good brews, and this Pils is no exception.","WilliamPhilaPa","0"
