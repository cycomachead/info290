4.88,23.9,4.75,4.75,5,5,4.75,"The first thing that hit me, (and made me smile), was the color. Stout is my preferred style of beer so I naturally drink a lot of dark, heavy, full-bodied ales. This one poured out a solid 3 SRM, which brought a smile to my face. Well done guys. Firestone Walker recommends drinking this no more than 120 days from their "Bottled on" date and I cracked this bottle open on day 144, (an oversight to be sure). So there wasn't as much carbonation as would be expected but it still put any of the big 3 adjunct lagers to shame. The nose was pleasant and subtle. The hops were there, but not in an in your face (Simcoe®) kind of way. My first impression of the taste was “balanced.” You can taste the hops and the malt, but neither one is over powering or competing with the other. Very light mouth feel. As a stout drinker I’m tempted to say it was watery…. But I don’t think that’s accurate. In fact when I decided to write this review I had to really focus on the style of beer I was drinking, and make sure I’m not judging it by another style’s standards. For what this beer was crafted to be, it delivers. In my humble opinion it hits all the benchmarks of a German Pilsner, (with a twist). The marketing seems to be that this is a hoppy pilsner, and while that is accurate, it is also misleading. The bitterness is well balanced in this beer. The hops are there, but I’m not sure I would define this as a “hop forward” or even “hoppy” beer. It’s a well balanced German Pilsner with some interesting layers. A very enjoyable beer.","sremed60","Saturday at 01:04 AM"

Aroma is herbal and grassy noble hops with a dash of toasted malt. Flavor brings the noble hops to the forefront with lots of grassy and herbal flavors. A dash of lemony citrus and some sweet toasted malt come through. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing with some creaminess. Overall a very nice hoppy Pilsner.","stephenjmoore","Apr 01, 2015"

The delicate cracker-like and slightly grassy malt may not seem that inspiring, but when you slather it in floral, spicy/peppery, and grassy hops and you get that wet-hay and lemon characteristic going on as well, it's actually fairly complex! At the very least it's not quite the same beer from sip to sip; and it's almost compellingly drinkable. Well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Nov 20, 2014"

This one is definitely closer in style to the traditional examples than Prima Pils, as this one preserves are more assertive bready malt and slightly sharper lager edge. Really a fine beer, and one that perfectly fit on this Indian Summer day here in Eastern MA. Would buy again and would highly recommend for craft lager lovers.","Beric","Oct 16, 2014"

A brief pseudo-cascade created three fingers of dense, puffy, bone-white head with great retention. It later created some great lacing as it finally fell.  Color was Pale-Yellow (SRM = 1 – 2) with NE-plus quality clarity and I thought about my last stream which was darker than this! Nose was intensely grassy with just a hint of biscuit malt. This had better be identified as a Czech Pilsner! (Nope, I was offline at the time, but I now see that it is a GER Pils.) Mouthfeel was medium, but soft, as though they had tried to rein it in a little, so as not to overpower the casual drinker. The taste was definitely Saaz hops, very grassy, with just enough malt to keep the dastardly lion and his hops in Czech, I mean check. Finish was semi-dry, perfectly balanced and quite refreshing. I CAN assure you that if they were to begin CANning this beer, I would happily fill a Summer cooler with it.","woodychandler","Sep 17, 2014"

Super pilsner hop aroma reaches across the room to smack you in the face, as if to say, "hey, there's a pilsner here, why aren't you drinking it?" (Note: benefits from being served in a glass.) This is apparently thanks to dry hopping with Saphir, a relative of German Hallertauer. Flavor is in line with expecations: super crisp, sharp bite of hops, though not overall particularly bitter. Finishes really dry. A great example of the style.","hreb","Jul 27, 2014"

The taste brings in more of the same, those flowers and grasses really rocking things, though without singing the tongue. Nice.

3.52,-10.7,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Overall: Not bad, really. However, there’s not enough Pilsner in this beer, really. It probably has Pils malt in it, but it’s really not easy to taste any. It’s got lots of citrus flavors, which as you read above predominate, some bitterness which are quite reminiscent of Noble hops. It feels like a Saphir hop beer with a touch of Pils flavor. If you want to make a hoppy Pilsner, the problem is, you need to start with a good Pils. It reminds me of an IPA that’s all hops and not much else. It’s basically not very balanced, and for me, I like strong flavors, even extreme flavors, but balanced means there’s more than one note being played. I’ve used Saphir, a relatively newly developed German hop that has some, and it’s got some citrus flavor to it, but not this much. Basically, you’ve got a semi-bitter, citrus infused beer with only enough Pils malt sweetness to nominally call this a good Pils. I love that they used Saphir and tried some new hops, but I’d rather a Schönramer, Mahrs, Faust or Kneitinger try it with their normal Pils. Now that would be a wow beer. I get the feeling FW should try making an outstanding Pils first, then make it “hoppy." It's hard to score this... maybe a 3.7 of 5.","boddhitree","Jun 06, 2014"

The taste is a good amount of hops up front. Grassy and spicy hops with and nice blend of the malts and funk . Toasted malts and cut grass at the finish. A hint of lemon. Insanely drinkable. Medium amount of carbonation with a light mouthfeel. Very little alcohol presence. This makes for one hell of a summer beer.

Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution and adhering to the walls of the glass. Some residual textured spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is grassy and expresses light, pale, biscuity malts and a hint if lemon. Taste is crisp and clean - consistent with nose with a kiss of fruity esters and a light, residual noble hops earthy bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a crisp, nearly clean finish. Just an all around excellent Czech Pilsner. So glad to have had the chance to try this one fresh.","Jwale73","Apr 23, 2014"

In body, the beer is nearly as clear as water with no particles and a steady stream of bubbles dancing through it. On the nose, the beer smells of buttery cracker malt with a solid bitter, herbal scent with a touch of mint and fresh grass. On the very edges of the nose stone fruit can be sensed alongside fresh pine needles. On the tongue, the beer tastes superbly bitter upfront with wonderful balancing bready sweetness. Soft acidity from the hops wets the sides of the mouth and provides a very, very light pucker. There is even a soft touch of earthy salinity in the beer. In flavor the beer tastes of bitter grass and herbal hops, mellowing into a smooth butter cracker malt. The finish is blend of smooth white bread and grassy bitters with just a touch of gooseberry, salt, and a mineral-earthy flavor. This is a grassy bitter beer at heart, but it has a wonderful balance of sweet malt and mineral-like flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavy side of light in body with a creamy carbonation and a definite prickly-crisp mouthfeel that leaves the mouth refreshed and tingling with saliva in the cheek pouches and a slight neutrality throughout the rest of the beer. Overall, this is a superbly hoppy pilsner with awesome subtle complexity. The beer is refreshing and perfect to nearly session.","Maxwell","Mar 05, 2014"

Take that into account when reading this. No mistaking it, this is a Pilsner, it tastes like a Pilsner, and looks like a Pilsner, but the taste has something most Pilsners miss, and that's some flavor. Set this beer down next to a Budweiser and just by looking at it, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but after tasting it there would be no doubt. I would say people who prefer IPA's over Pilsners and Lagers will still not really like this beer, or find it average at best.

Big hoppiness and bitterness for a pils, even this far out from bottling. The dry-hopping stands out with an oily grassy flavor. Complex herbal notes are nice. Malt is minimal, simple cereal notes. Dryness is spot on for the style. A solid pils that stands up well to all but the best German examples but with the west coast dry-hop twist that sets it apart.","bump8628","Dec 22, 2013"

The has a strong hoppy smell that is balanced out by the sweet pale malt smell that balances the beer very well. The hop smell is earthy and certainly dry-hopped. The taste is similar to the smell but with a stronger hop taste than malt taste. The hop is as bitter as the smell. The mouthfeel is very smooth with biting carbonation.

The lack of any real malt character and the resiny hop bitterness make this beer more akin to an IPA (big draw there, no?) than a Pilsner. I'm sure this is Firestone's answer to the IPL, and thus the excitement from BA members, but I'd sooner know that "Pilsner" on the label is giving me that style.","steveh","Dec 10, 2013"

Nice clean malt in the aroma as well.  Taste starts with a firm bitterness up front, moves into a spicy and juicy hop flavor, surprising for a pilsner.  Light bready and candy malt flavors move in as well, slight acidity to the finish, gives the malt a nice 'twang'.  Mouthfeel is light, beer is well carbonated, gives it a nice bite.

Enjoyed from a Firestone walker snifter. brew pours a transparent straw yellow with a thin fizzy head that fizzled away kind of quickly leaving some fizzy patches on the surface. Smells of crisp hop. Taste is classic pilsner with some subtle bitterness on the finish and soft fruit notes on the top. toasted german malts. Easy drinker and nice pilsner. Not my favorite style but a great representation if the style.","cosmicevan","Jun 11, 2013"

3.61,-8.4,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The palate opes quite crisp, with a pleasant, modest hoppy bitterness that's a blend of earth and lemon. Mineral character is low, accentuating the soft malt character, the mild DMS and unfortunately, the soap. Medium-light in body, moderately slick on the palate, this beer lacks the bitterness it needs to fully tie it together. Carbonation is high but quite creamy and pleasant. A touch watery on the finish, along with a little citrus, this beer is quite decent.","DefenCorps","Jun 10, 2013"

American barley malt, on the light side, balanced. it is refreshing, but the hops don't quite take away the sweetness of the malt. very little bitterness to this, only a mild hop flavor, maybe leaning on the floral side, but this certainly does not redefine the genre as it was supposed to do. its plenty drinkable through, these go back like water after a jog. the body is ultra light, and the carbonation is robust. it just tastes like very other craft pilsener, there is nothing new or special about this one. too simple for me to get off on, but its well made like all firestone beers, but ill stick to their solace for summer time, assuming that one comes back around...","StonedTrippin","May 17, 2013"
