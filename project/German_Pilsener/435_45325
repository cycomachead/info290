The pilsner pours a pale golden color, darker than straw, about the same as a Budweiser, with a nice soapy head and some satisfying lacing on the glass. A very pleasing aroma; sweet malts, grassiness, and a slightly metallic scent. The taste is very appealing, a soft graininess, cereal, sweet grass, some herbal and mineral tastes show up in the finish. I feel like this may come from the varieties of hops used and they fit nicely in the profile. A sip sits nicely in the mouth with a medium-thin body and a nice level of carbonation that doesnt over-do it. This is not a complex brew by any means, but it's more pleasant and drinkable than you would expect. A drawback is the sweetness that become somewhat cloying after several beers, but It's become my everyday session beer based on its price, availability and drinkability.","Aaron_Ramson","Jul 26, 2013"
