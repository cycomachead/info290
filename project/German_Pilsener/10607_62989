4,2.6,,,,,,"Pours a clear straw color with a big white head that descends to a scummy coating.  OK retention a touch of lacing.  The smell and the flavor are both flatly bready/bitter.  Really clean fresh aroma with some herbal/citric hop smells.  The flavor is bracing with green herbal hop characteristics (almost like mint or basil), there is some definitely clean malt and yeast character to it.  Super drinkable with a light body and a medium finish (in kind of hangs around but is pretty clean).  Excellent pilsener.  Stays true to being fairly inoffensive and drinkable while still cramming in some flavor from the European-tasting hops.  Would have again; excellent 'good' beer for pale lager lovers.","TheDoctor","Nov 28, 2014"

Very citrusy. Taste is like a cross between a pilsner and a pale ale. You get that smooth bready malt up front with a nice hop bite in the finish. Grapefruit, maybe some pine and fruity sweetness. Mouthfeel is awesome. Really light and not overly carbonated. Goes down easy and really drinkable. Overall a very solid beer. Sixpoint can do no wrong in my eyes.

I wouldn't quite call it an india pale lager, but its getting there stylistically with all the hops, for me at least it is. big hop flavors pick up about mid palate where the hefty pilsener malt base leaves off. its never too biter, but has a resinous dank hoppy dominance to it. a little filling, fuller bodied for the style, and I didn't find it to be as crisp per se as advertised, but I like this beer quite a bit. an easier drinking summer hoppy brew than and ipa, but this will likely not please those in search of an authentic german pils.","StonedTrippin","Aug 14, 2014"

A creamy two finger white head that fell fast but left gorgeous lace, a ring and cap. Nose is outrageous simplicity. Outstanding malt, spicy hops, yeast and a touch of lemon. Subtly floral. Clean. The malt is deep and strong but not sweet. Bread and grain. Taste is is terrific. Crisp like the name suggests. It has a slight bitterness, a bit of pucker from the lemon but no sour or real fruitiness. The malt is outstanding and playful. It adds a grainy bite of it’s own to go alongside the hop bite and the carbonation and really shines. Deep & full but not heavy it offers just a little honey to keep it soft on the palate and to keep the palate interested. Finishes dry with some oil and bitter, a good lingering aftertaste. Body is a touch watery but smooth and slightly herbal. Earthy and flavorful. Easy to drink. Uncomplicated.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

I liked the larger can size, I will say. For a beer that you'd want to session, that was perfect. But for me this was not only forgettable, but somewhat lacking.

Hops is big but not overboard with a quick bite that seems a combination of the hops and carbonation. This is a pilsner with flavor yet without being a bomb, or seeming to much like an IPA. The bite gives it a clean and crisp finish, yet just the right amount of hoppy goodness lingers long on the palate. Sixpoint definitely hit the mark on this one.

3.96,1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"16 oz can pours a medium amber with persistent fluffy white head - truly a beauty of a beer. Aroma is grassy with lemon, and caramel malt. Bitter pepper and grassy hops mark the flavor, although a bit soapy. Crisp is a perfect description for the mouthfeel - a nice hoppy bite, sharp to the tongue, mellowing in the finish. German Pilseners were my first "quality" beer love after making a trip to Deutchland and this one is a nice representation of the style. Would think this would make a great session beer for both craft and Miller Lite drinkers.","coldriver","Oct 28, 2012"

Light bready malt underpins a melange of hop notes with lemon and grass giving a delightful fruitiness with a spicy a faintly peppered edge. Taste has me teetering on the fence of perfect. Balance is superb with a light sweet malt base that pushes into lemon and grass. Firm bitterness is quite smooth followed by a gentle buttery biscuit that lingers after the swallow. A bit of drying mintiness a herbal hops as well in the finish and swallow. Feel is crisp with a softness on the tongue from the mild but active carbonation. Deeply thirst quenching and satisfying. Medium light weight is spot on. Drinkability is off the charts as is the overall character to this beer. A Darn near perfect pilsner imo.","scootny","Sep 23, 2012"

The malt profile is a blend of pils, honey and a little bit of caramel-like malts. The pilsner malt does taste a little raw, lending a mild doughy flavor. However, the sweetness is a little bit on the high side (and the solution isn't to amp up the hops, which are already a little too high for the style), but still does work. With flavors of mild honey and a lingering bitterness (lemon peel, earth) on the finish, this light bodied beer is pretty clean (I can't pick out any sulfur) and enjoyable. The mid-palate is faintly watery, but it isn't too much of a distraction. Light in body, moderately resiny and with a medium-high level of carbonation, this feels good on the palate. In some ways, it seems like the higher hopping level was chosen to add a snappy, resiny feel to offset the relatively soft water, and it does strike me as a bold and distinguishing step. Nicely done, this is possibly the most enjoyable Sixpoint beer I've had.","DefenCorps","Jun 26, 2012"

Smell is very floral and herby with some bready malt aromas. Very nice. Taste is of very tasty floral and herb hops up front with a malt backbone. I am also getting some citrus flavors on the aftertaste. Like the name implies, this beer is very crisp and clean in the mouth. Overall, this is an awesome beer with delicious aromas and tastes.

4.01,2.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"16oz. can served in a Spiegelau pilsener. Pours the color of straw with a semi-hazy clarity and a three inch, dense, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Thick bands of textured lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is grassy with a trace of citrus zest and a ripe, earthy/floral character most likely attributable to the hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also a light, bready quality that comes out behind the citrus. There's also faint spiciness in the flavor profile that adds a little additional interest. Mouthfeel is light-medium, but closer to light, with an even, refreshing carbonation. I was actually expecting more of a semi-dry finish to this. Overall, I found this beer to be immensely drinkable and refreshing. I feel like there's a little more happening here than you would generally find with the style, but I'm okay with it. A really easy drinking offering and a nice bridge beer for BMC drinkers in my opinion.","Jwale73","Sep 01, 2011"

A rolling malt profile is like fresh baked bread lightly toasted with a nice crisp fruitiness a touch of sulfur and lingering bittering hops with herbal/citric flavors arising. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a sturdy level of carbonation going on, overall a pretty nice beer.

3.7,-5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The Crisp pours into the glass a subtle yellow color with faded golden highlights. A inch of burnt sugar tinted foam on top that vanishes and leaves little stick. Scents include pale malt, a heaping of German hop variety, pilsner malt, Etc. Taste comes on pretty strong which is a good thing although a bit too big for a pils. If I were mashing styles i would put this at German IPA. A lot of grassy earthy hops with a nice bready bite. Biscuit flavor is very large, pilsner malt as well. It's amazing how much taste this has with such a low ABV. Feel is bitter and in between light and medium. It's carbed up well in the 1st 1/2 but the second flattens it out. I enjoyed the first half but struggled through the 2nd. It's just too much of a good thing, that being the German influence/ingredients. This screams USA interpretation of a style.

3.14,-19.5,4,2.5,3,4,3.5,"While sixpoint does many wonderful things with this beer, I think it is important to point a few things out. Lager beer is not traditionally dry-hopped. Dry hopping is traditional in english ale brewing. I find that the aroma in the crisp is too ale like. While the mouthfeel and taste are purely pilsener like, the aroma is misleading. Also, Lager beer should be drank cold. The 16 ounce can gets too warm before you get down to the end, releasing that DMS flavor, they so cleverly tried to mask by dry hopping. Great can. great story. But the crisp is too malty sweet. The bitterness is an after note. There are some great Lager moments in this beer though.","james35","Jul 06, 2011"

It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor along with a damn fine German hop bitterness. It's flavorful with a solid malt base; easy drinking with just enough sweetness to balance the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a lager I can get behind. It's "crisp" with sacrificing the flavor.","WesWes","Jul 05, 2011"

4.27,9.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Well balanced with an initial doughy sweetness followed by a crisp clean hoppy finish. Light and zippy mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation. All around great beer. Probably the best American made German pils I've ever had.","Jmamay22","Jun 29, 2011"

4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: This is what you imagined beer tasting like, when you were a young lad, and you saw the big imposing American macro advertisement in your favorite team's ball park. Until the day you realized that the american macro is for frat parties, and beer pong, and to be disrespected. This is what a pilsner should have been my first time around.","rodney45","Jun 29, 2011"
3.53,-9.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear gold with a soapy cap of white foam. The frothy head fell quickly, leaving a thin skim of bubbles on top of the beer and quite a bit of clumpy lacing on the glass. Floral and grassy hop aroma, a little spicy, with some dry malt and fruity undertones. Hoppy and malty up front, fruity, then dry bitterness kicks in towards the end. More floral and spicy notes, light citrus. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel rather than crisp, moderate carbonation. Overall, pretty solid and a tasty beer.","DrJay","Jun 24, 2011"

3.41,-12.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"overall, its a decent hoppy lager that doesn't quite excite me like Noble Pils or a fresh Prima Pils, but one that I wouldn't mind drinking again or recommending to a crossover drinker.","silentjay","Jun 21, 2011"

3.32,-14.9,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Many thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a deep golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malts and hops are in there. Taste is a bit hoppy for this style, some malts are present, finishes bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall while not a bad beer, I feel it is a little bit over hopped for this style.","tone77","Jun 20, 2011"
4.45,14.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall a great beer, pretty much the definition of sessionable, great crisp lager flavors, a nice malt flavor and aroma, and just the right about of fresh grassy mild hops of which get just a bit too spicy and bitter on the finish, but I'm just nitpicking at that point.","jlindros","Jun 19, 2011"

3.78,-3.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"These boys know what they are doing in the CAN! The Crack & Glug netted two foamy fingers of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a very grassy hops flavor, Saaz perhaps, but I could not quite place it. Mouthfeel was medium with a soft, grassy hops presence on the tongue. It was definitely a German-style Pils as opposed to a Czech Pils, given the muted nature of the hops. Yinz want to know what to CAN next? A Czech Pils! Go for more than just a kiss of the hops, you buncha Schlitz! I have to admit, it was crisp, both in terms of taste and finish, but it wasn't crisp enough. It should have been as crisp as lettuce or celery, but it was only carrot crisp. I'm feeling pretty crisp about now. CAN I see myself putting this into the cooler? Sure! I'm not that hung up on crispness.","woodychandler","Jun 17, 2011"

4.34,11.3,5,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall: Really an outstanding beer that is now a candidate to be drank all summer long. Between this and Sweet Action, Sixpoint is really killing it on the lower side of the ABV scale.","soze47","Jun 13, 2011"

Bengali Tiger absolutely blows this one away, and the Righteous Ale also beats this one out quite easily. Give it a shot. For me, not my style.","VelvetExtract","Jun 11, 2011"
3.95,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,5,4,"Very nice, refreshing pils with spot on carbonation. Crisp indeed, tingly, palate cleansing carbonation. Earthy, pine riddled hops showing spicy qualities with some floral accents on the finish. Bready throughout and really just a quaff monster. Would love to have these cans at my disposal in the lovely land of Ohio, well maybe not lovely.","mcallister","Jun 10, 2011"

3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This is the recently canned version. Pours a standard but very clean looking yellowy color, thin head. Nose is subtle grassy hops and some faint apple notes. Taste follows suit with a nice kiss of hops, earthy and musty, and a faint fruity notes of grain and some husk. Crisp (had to) and prickly on the palate, very very refreshing and drinkable. Great to be drinking Sixpoint at home on my couch - can't wait to try their other canned offerings.","twelvsies","May 27, 2011"

3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"On tap at Spritzinger in Brooklyn for $6/pint. Poured clear golden yellow with a short white head. Clearly an American take on the style, the hops dominated the character. They were the more floral, less spicy, type of Nobel hops, pretty similar to Sam Adams' Noble Pils. I'd guess Tettnanger. Overall it was a tasty, hoppy pils, but I wanted a little more depth from the malt (of which there wasn't much flavor) and variation in the hops.","tempest","May 01, 2011"
4.5,15.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bight golden, lively, with a creamy white foam head. Nose is very delicate with soft bready malt and floral hop aromas, and a hint of hard-boiled egg. Prickly carbonation up front. And, like its name suggests, this is one crisp--"very crisp"--beer. Nice bite of herbal and pith, with a quick snap of dry bitterness, and suggestions of mint and green wood. It eventually yields to a smooth, but firm, body. Malt character is expectedly light. Touch of honey and a complementary biscuity note that pairs well with the beer's crispness, and adds more depth to the overall dryness of the beer. Very quenching, more-ish and insanely drinkable. One of our favorite Sixpoint offerings to date. Tastes like a fresh import. Zwei Maß Crisp, bitte!","BeerAdvocate","Apr 06, 2011"

Morning toast, some granulation and grassy, earthy hops are in my nose. The beer is tasty, Munichly malty with some hop presence, fairly low bitterness. It is okay, good for an American rep of a German pils. I was in no way offended by this beverage. Quite drinkable in fact.","dragonWhale","Mar 25, 2011"

3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I would like a little more hop bite to my pilsner, but I don't think that is what Sixpoint was going for with this one. It certainly is crisp and quaffable, which means it was a success.","Hojaminbag","Feb 11, 2011"
