APPEARANCE: transparent, sallow yellow body; off-white head begins well but flattens to a casual smear... AROMA: beefy, doughy, buttery fragrance associated with cheaper, imported, green-bottled lagers... PALATE: drinkably nondescript--light and refreshing but so liquid, the only thing left is a small biscuity aftertaste...TASTE: thin, sweet and syrupy flavors dominate a rather weak profile... OVERALL: tough to slam a beer that is as happily drinkable as SPG, so I will instead suggest that in the right circumstance, this beer could compliment the standard party fair...but it doesn't distinguish itself much from the other green-bottled brethren...","dacrza1","Dec 14, 2014"

4,39.9,4,4,4,4,4,"some people may not even be familiar with the differences, but these import lagers ive tried in both green and brown bottles, they always taste better in the brown bottle, and its easily noticeable. The green bottle gives the beer an almost sour sweetness, and the brown bottle has a more natural grainy tasting sweetness without the sour flavor which is also referred to as a skunky flavor. The thing ive noticed, is that when i purchase a 12 pack package of this st. pauli girl beer, since the beer is not exposed to light, the beer taste more like it should taste without that certain skunky sweetness. i pour it into a glass from a distance to get rid of the extra carbonation put in it, and it taste absolutely awesome over a 6 beer drinking session. I just suggest to get it in the 12 pack package so that the beer has not been effected by light.","upperclass420","Jun 24, 2014"

Perfect carbonation and absolutely good drinkability. Decent stuff!! I don't have evidence of this, but as St. Pauli is brewed in the Beck's Brewery in Bremen and sold only in the US, I am convinced (after side-by-side taste tests) that St Pauli is the closest thing you'll get in the US to Beck's Gold (if it isn't the same exact product).","tugdriver7","Jun 09, 2009"

The flavors were also a bad mix, sweet processed malt at first followed quickly by a bitter hops that did not balance properly. The middle was vapid, weakly thought-out and unassertive.

The green bottles were boxed which would keep the sunlight out, that must have helped. Taste had a hint of mild malt and was somewhat floral. Faint grains detected as well. Leaves the mouth dry, but not cotton mouth. Average to above average carbonation in this batch. Went down rather easily and I was surprized it wasn't skunky..keeping sunlight off the bottles changed the way this one smelled and tasted.

A beer slightly on the dark side of amber (more natural and less sickley looking than that bright macro yellow common to so many American macros). With a lively head that mostly disappeared quickly. Smell wasn't great. Partly the crisp barley smell you want from a pils, but also a bit on the skunky side which had me worried this was a Heineken clone. Taste was better. Though the first sip had me worried (it was also remeniscent of Henie), it quickly got better. All in all the hops and barley were nicely balanced. This was a crisp easily drinkable beer, but the flavor was still assertive, basically the beer Heineken and Becks both tried and failed to brew (Becks because its too weak, Heineken because it just tastes like spoiled crap). Overall the pleasant (if uncomplicated) taste and crisp lightness suggest a great session beer to me. I'd rate this the third best pils I've ever had (behind Czechvar and Urquell) and my second favorite. Nothing fancy here, but Pilsner isn't supposed to be fancy. They got the formula right. Ideal as a session beer or a lawnmower-BBQ beer if you can ignore the import price.","casualbeerman","Jan 03, 2007"

Taste was better, a well blended mix of unidentifiable sweetness, hops and a subtle citrus, very nicely complemented by an almost creamy thickness and a fizzy kick, but the aftertaste was all sweet and left a bad impression.

The profile of this beer is lean, with a corn like aftertaste and a latent hint of saltiness on the finish, nowhere as upfront and vivacious as its neighbor in Bremen, Becks. SPG is on the Atkins diet, and needs to put on some weight by increasing her carbohydrate intake. This beer lacks the bitter element that makes even other mainstream pilsners true to their heritage.

The nose is limited, but displays a light touch of herbal/spicy hops amidst sweet malt. The body is light/medium and it's mildly crisp and then lightly creamy and smooth across the palate. The flavor displays a low level hop flavor and underlying bitterness that's tightly woven within a softly sweet malt. It's so well intertwined, in fact, that the beer seems almost one-sided. Of course, that does lend somewhat to a "give me more" drinkability. It appears to include andjunct, but the bottle label clearly states that it's "brewed in strict accordance with the German purity law of 1516". If that's actually true, I'm sure they must be using a good deal of highly undermodified "chit" malt as the flavor seems lacking in any real "grainy" character. It finishes dry with a subtle lingering note of sweet malt that's eventually backed up by a low bitterness.

2.63,-8,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"In high school, I thought I was upscale if I drank this. Slightly better than Heinikan, with the same yellowish hue. You can barely taste the hops, but there is no bad aftertaste. This beer is definetly brewed with mass marketing in America in mind.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 01, 2002"
4.22,47.6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Good bier. It is similar to Heineken but better. It has a golden straw color to it and a clear but slightly funky skunk smell to it. The taste is just a step above Heineken. The mouthfeel and drinkability is very smooth and easy. I really enjoy this beer.","tang214","Sep 29, 2002"

3.15,10.1,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Initial aroma of graininess, but turns to a fresh hops smell.  Pale yellow and crystal clear.  Head is fizzy and thins fairly quickly.  Taste is a little grainy and a little sweet at the start.  Has appropriate dryness and crispness for style.  Mildly lingering dryness.   Thinner feel, but plenty of carbonation.  There are better beers for style, but this is drinkable and I doubt I'll turn it down it offered.","garymuchow","Aug 05, 2002"
2.06,-28,3,2,2,2,2,"A very mediocre beer.  As others have mentioned, the St. Pauli girl on the label is nice, but that is about the extent of this beer's redeeming qualities.  Pours out to a slightly, darker golden color, with a bizarre smell.  Taste is that of light struck hops.  If fresh, this can be decent, but with so many other good choices out there, this one isn't high on my list.","proc","Jul 02, 2002"
3.05,6.6,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"it beats a heine or a becks any day. it has very drinkable characteristics being light and crisp. the flavor is a bit bitter which may turn many people away, but it is still a decent brew.","ElGuapo","Jul 02, 2002"
3,4.9,3,3,3,3,3,"All-around average beer. There are much better Pilsners out there that are less skunky. I don't know if they will ever learn to do away with the green bottles. It's usually Russian Roulette with these.","Dogbrick","Jun 27, 2002"
2.78,-2.8,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Pale yellow color with almost no head.  Toasted grain with a slight touch of skunk.  Crisp sweet, floral, herbal, spicy flavor that is decently balanced between the malt and hops with a touch of skunk.  Must be the green bottle.  If it weren't for the skunkiness, this could be a good lager.  Nevertheless, IMHO, St. Pauli Girl is better than a Heineken and a Becks.","ThreePistols","Jun 20, 2002"
3.17,10.8,2.5,3,3,3,4,"Spicey and herbal  hop character.   Light body, finishes dry.  Very pale straw color.  Not quite as good as grolsch, but a decent Pilsner none-the-less.","Jordan","Jun 07, 2002"

3.08,7.7,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Light straw hue w/ a moderate head and typical Pils clarity.   The grassy, mildly spicy Saaz hop nose hits my nose at first but the mild skunky mercaptans detract from my enjoyment. Hop bitterness is quite firm and adds to the crispness of this beer.  Fuller in body than other German Pilsners.  The slight skunked flavors compromise what would be a pretty good Pilsner.  St. Pauli Girl finishes soft, clean, a touch grainy, and a bit sweet.  Although not a particularly great pilsner, I'll take this over a Heineken any day.","marc77","Apr 16, 2002"

2.68,-6.3,3,2.5,3,2,2.5,"Clean and crisp, if in shape, which is not often by my experience...drank 'em in the 80s until Sam Adams showed that cold fermenters had more flavor potential...honestly, I've had very few St. Paulis that weren't "skunked" -- sometimes, severely...","ADR","Feb 20, 2002"
