3.39,-1.7,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, corn-yellow coloring with a ton of slow carbonation in the body, and a fluffy, dense, small bubbled, white head. Aromas of citrus sweet, bubblegum, toasted grains, subtle herbal notes, and some nutmeg and clove spice. Flavors are sweet and herbal forward, with a subtle cracker and bread backbone, and lemongrass, clove, and all-spice highlights, with subtle tart citrus characteristics. The herbal tones overpower a bit, and there is subtle hops bitterness that enhances that imbalance. Light, effervesced body, that moves close to astringent as the beer leaves your palate. The aftertaste is lemon-citrus and heavy spice, still. Dry, again almost astringent, finish.","GarthDanielson","Jun 22, 2014"

There's some pilsner malt that isn't quite as sharp as is typical, but the spicy hops make up for that.

I'll take most of the flavors with a grain of salt as it is a bit older, but still not a great beer IMO.","jlindros","Sep 27, 2012"

If you're looking for something that's light, crisp and easy to drink, you can't go wrong here.

Smells of steamed veggies and other adjuncts in the corn department. Tastes like a adjunct lager, honestly one of the lower grade ones. A touch of pale and crystal malts, and a bit of noble presence. This is another that I wont be getting again from SW, these summer creations just aren't up to par with the rest of the others. Overall, if you get it from a pal, or an extra in a trade its worth a shot, but if you see it in the store and are pondering on purchasing, your best bet is to grab whatever is sitting beside it, even if its a pack of swill in my opinion.

I always have trouble picking up what to describe the sweentess as in lagers and pilsners. I guess corn? Anyways has quite a nice pilsner smell. Taste is sharp and pleasantly bitter. Has a nice underlined sweetness in the aftertaste. Is this beer a hybrid? The label kind of suggested it was. But it really does have a pale ale quality to it. One of the more flavorful Pilsners I have encountered. Carbonation is cranked up pretty high but I actually like it in this style. This beer is solid!

It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was not really that great, but not horrible either...

Basically the conclusion that we came to is who cares about the style? What really matters is simply how the beer tastes. Well I looked at the label for Road Trip and didn't see anything about style. I didn't bother to actually read the writing to the side that explained it, I just poured it and figured I'd figure it out. It was golden. OK. Slightly hazy. OK. Smelled a touch spicy. OK. I figured it was a witbier. But it wasn't. It was very dry. Not brashly bitter, but assertive for sure. There was a bit of fruitiness to it... kind of like grapefruit. And a subtle tartness in the background. I teetered. I kind of liked it, kind of didn't. I supposed I could take it or leave it, which basically means I'd leave it. Then I read the label, noting that it was intended as a pilsner and changed my opinion of the beer completely. I just didn't see it as a pilsner with an ale yeast. It seemed like American hops were used. Or maybe it was a bad bottle or off batch (it was within code). Hmmmm. How easily we're influenced. So, taking a step back, I can say that hedonistically I didn't really dig it. It was OK. I think it would go great at a back-yard barbeque. I might have one at a bar.

However, unlike the lagers from Bohemia, this one seemed to have no trouble forming and holding a pillowy, and foamy head. The aroma was spicy which I presume was due to use of Saaz hops. There was very slight hint of DMS in the form of cooked corn, but it did not smell out of place for a fresh Pilsner. The taste was softer than a Pilsner, with lingering sweetness that was very pleasing. The hops were present the form of a mineralized backbone. The mouthfeel was creamy and soft. It was hard to shoehorn this into a style, but I'd put it somewhere between a Strong Ale, Cream Ale, and Pilsner. No ABV listed on the label, but the alcohol was not a big factor, so I would venture a guess at this being in the neighborhood of 5-6%. Very easy to drink, with no flaws found in any department, which I'd say is a pretty damn good piece of work considering the major departure from the original recipe.","rajendra82","May 17, 2007"
4.04,17.1,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Enjoyed this one on my back porch. Beer pours a golden straw color that's somewhat hazy at the top of the glass. I soon discover this has more to due with the 80 degree heat than the characteristics of the beer. Lots of carbonations bubbles float to the top, where sits a very loose one-inch head of very large bubbles. Looks like a run-of-the-mill pilsner. The nose, however, is something different all together. Had I not read the label to discover this a pilsner hybrid brewed with ale yeast, I still would've known something was up from the nose. It smells like a pilsner, but there is something unique about the aroma that I can't quite put my finer on. There is a big biscuity malt smell present. Whatever it is, its appetizing to say the least. The taste is a quick snap of hop bitterness, not overwhelming, but perhaps a bit more than, say, a Pilsner Urquell. This gives way to a long, biscuity middle before fading into a dry, crisp, clean finish. The aftertaste is pretty long and dominated by a citrus note. Pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is thin, but that seems to be the aim. All things considered, this is a pretty exceptional summertime beer. Great for a ball game or hanging out by the pool. Its clean, extremely easy drinking, and flavorful. I'm sure some hopheads might find it to weak or dull, but this is indeed a session beer and a refreshing one at that. I will be hitting this one up again very soon.","0tt0","May 11, 2007"
