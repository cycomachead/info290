This was very too funky for me. In fact I did not even finish the bottle and tossed it. Other reviews have been much more positive - so maybe I got a bad bottle? Or maybe this is just not a style of beer for me.","sprat1960","Jun 27, 2014"
4.4,11.4,3.75,5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"The taste has a nice sour tartness, cherry pit, nutty brown malt, slight saltiness possibly from a sodium bicarbonate water treatment. Faint bitterness, lemon rind and must. Perhaps more aggressively acetic than some, this hits the style nail on head but with authority. It has ample malts, and finishes with sweetness that loses its battle to the tart mid palate and hereafter. Medium bodied ale with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good Flanders style brown made in Switzerland. Color me impressed guys, keep up the good work!","Stinkypuss","Jun 18, 2014"

4.14,4.8,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"an elite oud bruin, a bit more sour than some of the others on the market, this has a lot of flare though. the bottle is over 20 bucks, and unlike the framboise, i think this one is a lot closer to worth what it costs. dark dark brown, and rather clear until the dregs run down, not much head, but a shiny and radiant luster to this. the nose is insanely sour, lots of caustic acidic citric acid and lemon flavors, while grain tannins are robust as well. some roast, but not totally coca forward or bitter, unique brown grain bill that has some sugar before it stars getting weird. the taste starts with the richer malt, but moves rapidly into a classic oud bruin sourness. more than just lambic sour, this is unique and brutally intense, especially when it warms up. lemon sourness on a brown beer is unique and lovely, somehow delicate for being huge, and there is a long lasting dry burn on the tongue, which you dont always get with these. i love the fuller body, the depth of flavor, and the acid intensity, but its a tough bottle by your lonesome. it works a lot better as a share, since a ton of this will definitely turn the stomach all kinds of inside out. enough carbonation to be lively, very cool yeast profile, dry as they get for the style. top quality oud bruin, worth paying for if this is your style.","StonedTrippin","Feb 03, 2014"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vinegar, wood, tart raspberries, and subtle tart cherries. The flavor was of sweet malt, vinegar, tart cherries, wood, sugar, and subtle raspberries. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It was quite complex and enjoyable.

Light aromas of oak and cherries, with a strong whiff of sticky sweet balsamic vinegar reduction. Smells fresher than your average Oud Bruin, with the brightness of fresh grapes. The yeastiness coming through is funkier than expected, reminiscent of a saison. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a bit dry. Sweet notes of caramel and roasted almonds play nicely against mild flavors of tart fruit. The finish has a lingering balsamic vinegar sharpness","DaveHS","Beers"

Very well done and definitely underrated compared to some other beer form this style.","Phyl21ca","0"
