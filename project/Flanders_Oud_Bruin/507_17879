4.42,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Tall, white head, high retention. Suddsy lacing sticks to the glass. Body is a deep mahogany. Aroma is citric green apple, some vinegar, some malty sweetness in the background. This beer is noted for its sweet to sour balance. The sour dominates the aroma. Taste is mouth puckering, quite tart, again with green apples. The sweetness to me is on the back end and pretty faint. It does make for a unique experience. This beer is delicious and style points are certainly deserved.","KickbacksSteve","Nov 04, 2012"

Usually when I do this and gaer this muvh about it, its a let down. The best thing was the appearance. Loved the dark body, almost stout like, with nice white fluffy head. Poured inna tulip glass it looked like a sundae. Great aromas and flavors of dark malts and a nice medium body. Not overly sour and I loved the balance of sweetness.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a deep yellow reddish brown with a half finger light tan head that remained throughout. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, strawberry, sour, wood, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, strawberry, raspberry, fruit, sugar, wood, and subtle tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I went into this one not really knowing what to expect at all. What I found really wasn’t too bad. There was a huge amount of sweetness going on that made this one quite refreshing and easy to drink overall. This nice touch of tartness going on really helped this aspect as well to make it fairly well balanced. It would definitely be easy to drink quite a bit of this before realizing you had done so. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Oct 18, 2012"

Ruddy brown color, a small head that sank to a few stray bubbles. Aroma was not too pronounced, but there were definite tones of cherries and acetic acid. Taste...mmm...cherries up front, not too sweet, not too sour, but just right in the middle of the road. Great balance. Also detectable were notes of oak, red wine grapes, vinegar, and leathery new-car essence. About medium-bodied, juicy, but still very rich and flavorful, and not overly watery like other beers of the style that I've had. Very drinkable, very enjoyable.","Rifugium","Oct 31, 2011"

Some sweetness is noticeable. Palate opens very sweet, artificial, almost like Equal. It really gets in the way, covering up the grain and tartness.

I find this to be poorly blended, too much lager and not enough sour ale. Its definately a let down, compared to the aroma, which led me to believe this was going to be intensely sour.

Flavors of sweet fruit and dark berries are most present, as is a slight sourness that lurks in the background. Also a slightly roasted quality was present, which added to the limited complexity of this beer. Finished smooth, with some bite toward the end, but just enough to get your attention and invite you back for another sip. This is a good sipping ale. Highly recommended.

The flavor is slightly puckering initially, but quickly fades to a lightly tart and creamy cherry. It finishes very mellow. I like the striking difference from the initial flavor to the finish.

The smell was sharp and tart and even a bit sour, with a wild, citrus and cherry aroma going on -- I love it. The taste was tart to sour but with an underlying sweetness especially towards the finish. There were woody notes and some wild funkiness, and a fruity, cherry flavor (where does that come from?), and a base maltiness under it all. A great flavor that really grew on me from the first time I tasted this beer. The mouthfeel was wonderfullly tart with medium body and modest carbonation. The malt and tart flavors lingered in the aftertaste. This is a really great beer, and when it is fresh, it is incredible.

The taste was quite malty but pretty one dimensional with a bit of oak in the mix as well. This was OK, but bland for a flemish red, and nowhere near a rodenbach level of complexity.

It poured to a reddish brown color and left a fair sized off-white head that had nice retention and left very nice lacing through out the whole brew. The smells where very aromatic with dark fruits, mostly sour cherries being predominant. The taste is fantastic, sourness is very pronounced from the get-go along with a rich malt flavor. Also can notice yeast like flavor with this brew that seems to give it a bread like note. The sourness is very smooth and goes extraordinary well with this brew. This is an extremely easy drinking brew and I must say has become one of my favorites. If you can give this brew a try, matters if you enjoy this class of brew but if so I think you will be very happy!","Stimack","Jan 02, 2005"
3.84,-5.9,3,4,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel is somewhat grainy with a medium body and active carbonation. Wierd, but definately grows on you. I saw it on tap at Delaney's ( New haven, CT) but didn't try it. Now I wish that I had!!!","AlexJ","Dec 16, 2004"
4.17,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"It begins with this intense sourness that just gives way completely to a cherry note that ends with the cherries almost leaving and no sourness or tartness. It is quite incredible that this happens as the sourness just kind of kicks you and runs away rather quickly. Getting used to this one is amazing. I love the way it comes down. I don't think there should have been huge bubbly carbonation, but the slight carbonation is less than amazing. Good beer, though. Maybe some more tartness and some more carbonation next time.","twilight","Dec 04, 2004"

4.52,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The taste is divine. Some toffeeish malt flavors around the edges envelop the essence of this nectar, the tart, fruitiness that is mouth puckering. Sour cherries seem to combine with green apples plucked from the tree several weeks before they're ripe. Woody tones are noted as well, suggestive of oak barrel aging. The yeast is more prominent in the nose than the taste, but offers a welcome earthiness. The complexities combine for a subtle and well balanced palate, that is exceptionally drinkable. This ale is not heavy, at all, and is anything but cloying. I could have several of these at a sitting. I don't mean to imply that this is not a sipping ale, for it most certainly is. I can't believe that I only bought a single bottle. Another beer road trip is definitely in the near future, in order to acquire a decent stock of this fine Flanders Red. Gulpener, by the way, is brewed in Netherlands' Limburg province, very near the Belgian border, so this one can lay a good claim to regional authenticity. An excellent experience here! I need more.","merlin48","Oct 17, 2004"

3.53,-13.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep reddish auburn color with a medium beige head. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma is strong sour apple along with vinegar and spice. Medium-bodied and smooth with tart fruit (apple again), yeast and some malt tastes. Also a little bit of a Cabernet or Concorde grape wine flavor. The finish is fruity and earthy and maintains the sourness. I am still having trouble appreciating this style but I would probably try this again.","Dogbrick","Sep 14, 2004"
4.85,18.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Had this on tap at Redbones his weekend hanging with David and Uncle Jimbo. Pour was dark garnet in color, faint low tan head that went away leaving me with a small Rorshach (sp?) pattern on top. I had three of these in a row, and picked up different aromas in almost every glass, ranging from a sour fruit/kriek-like one, to concord grapes, to some musty barnyard aromas. I have to say, I haven't had a beer this good in a while, and it was definitely a real pleasure. Medium mouthfeel and fine carbonation add in making the taste last. The balance of sweet to tart is perfection, and both sensations are not over the top. Main flavor notes were low malt backbone, with really just sweet and tart fruit notes (one minute kriek, the other grape). There was some lingering astringency in the finish. Outstanding.","PatandDavid","Sep 13, 2004"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Great treat on draft at the Exton PA Drafting Room. Nice looking beer. Deep mahogany red with a light beige head that left scant but noticeable lacing. Smell is nice and funkified. Definately pick up the lactic sourness, but a distinct mustiness is present also that is also present as a flavor component. Something that I found ever so slightly amiss in this beer. Nice sweet component to the beer which balances the strong sourness, but that dirty kind of musty taste didn't sit right with me. I think I like a bit cleaner sourness in a Flander's Red. Perhaps it was just the rather strong sourness that makes me think its a bit musty. Decent mouthfeel. I wouldn't drink more than 2 or 3 of these, but all in all pretty good.","cerevisiaephilus","Aug 20, 2004"
4.52,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Overall: I happened to have this on draft at the Spuyten Duyvil during the NYC BA get together on July 24 this year. It seemed to have a tad more complexity and bite on draft from memory, as well as being a little sourer. This is rather strange, because I find the exact opposite for the Duchesse. Regradless, the bottle is still great though, but lacks a little when compared to the draft version. Nevertheless, this is an accomplished Flemish Red style ale for sure, and well worth seeking out.","TheLongBeachBum","Aug 08, 2004"
4.11,0.7,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Smells like a stinky sour cherry lambic, looks like a dark brown ale. The color of red-tinged bark with a miniscule but solid white head, left a good snail trail of lacing behind. A smooth chocolatey-malt taste of black cherries, sugar, caramel and overripe sour berries. Great light and silky mouthfeel, very drinkable beer. Free of aftertaste and very refreshing, we drank Spuyten dry of this stuff.","PopeJonPaul","Jul 07, 2004"
3.74,-8.3,4,2.5,4.5,4,3.5,"On tap at the Blind tiger, NYC. Pours ruby red with a reddish medium bubble head. Nose is clearly of spicy old stinky feet/cheese. Sharp, fruity,sour, cherries, plums and other fruit flavors in the mix. Malty flavors come in later and make this more user friendly. Sourness not overwhelming. Take some getting used to, but clearly an interesting, complex creation. Have an open mind and give this stuff a try.","Billolick","Jul 02, 2004"
