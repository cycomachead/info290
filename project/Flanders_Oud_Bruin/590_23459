Refreshing and fruity, like their fruit beers tend to be, but with a subtle bit of sour as well. I felt like I got some hop flavor in the beer too, but I wasn't sure. Either way, the beer is certainly an enigma, as the overall profile is interesting and complex. As usual, great job by Dan and co.!","SeanBond","Feb 17, 2015"
4.03,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Pours a ruby red with lacing head. Smell is red wine vinegar with sharp cherry notes. Taste is lighter than expected when compared to the strong nose. Cherry, vanilla up front, with rhubarb tart finish. Carbonation lasts throughout. Very well balanced, a nice bruin style from New Glarus.","RyBrew54","Feb 16, 2015"

Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, slightly hazed, blood amber coloring, with a sparse film of head on the pour that quickly clears up. Aromas of tart cherry and grape, chardonnay notes, rose petals, subtle vanilla cream, berry sweet, woody spice, and some earthy highlights. Very well balanced nose. Flavors are a blast of tart and sour fruit forward, with cherry, grape must, and a berry blend, with white wine dryness and bite, some woody notes, subtle char, and hints of crème. Extremely smooth, dry bodied throughout, with a tart, slightly sour cherry and berry blend aftertaste. The finish is crisp, clean, and dry. This is a tremendous beer!","GarthDanielson","Nov 02, 2014"

Aroma is light cherries, some sour vinegar, and a bit of caramel vanilla. Slick mouthfeel and tastes like cherries, vanilla, wood, and some apple. Maybe a hint of ginger and cinnamon but not "spice" by any means. Thr vanilla in the sour makes this one somewhat sweet. High carbonation keeps it very drinkable.

That being said, I would like this to be more sour, but luckily NG has the Wild Sour Ale to satisfy that particular craving. So Enigma definitely holds up well even a year later. Highly recommend to anyone who likes sours AND fruit beers because this is an awesome combination of both. I wish I had bought even more of this beer when it came out. I will have to await the next release of this beer, if there is indeed one.","Stevedore","Jul 09, 2013"

4.04,-2.9,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"an interesting Americanized version of this style. it pours a bright shining orange amber color with a milkshake head in khaki hue. the nose is a lot of fruit for the genre, dried cranberries, cherries, figs, pears, very strange. the sweetness from that runs into a sour wall of yeasty and bacterial fermentation which is almost sharp in the nose. flavor wise, the first thing I detect is the ridiculously high sugar content here. this beer is downright sweet. its a funny trait to have in a sour beer, but its there alright. the sour is a hyper acidic, peroxide feeling, intense front of tongue type that is not entirely compatible with the fruit flavors. everyone in our crowd thought this beer was incredible, I wasn't quite so compelled for that reason. in terms of mouthfeel, the sugar content is cloying, and frustratingly sickening. even half a bottle of this is too much for me. the sour leaves a sour patch kids burn on the tastebuds and roof of my mouth, and its just out of sync somehow. good carbonation though, and a body that would be right on if not for the sugar. overall its a challenging brew for me, a staple characteristic of this whole series from new glarus, and although its well made, its not something I intend to revisit. more of a personal thing though, and I suggest this to any sour fan, or new glarus fan more generally. on a side note, this reminds me of the flanders fred, which was a much anticipated but underwhelming brew. similar flavor profile and storyline here.","StonedTrippin","May 06, 2013"

I am often tempted to buy a case of this one when New Glarus releases it. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the beer was a pinkish red color. It reminded me a little of Cherry 7Up in appearance. The smell was tart cherries and vanilla, almost smelling like desert. While the aroma might make a drinker think of a sour, this is not classified as a sour. Tart cherries dominate the initial taste with vanilla in the background. The cherries dominate the taste in this one, but that is a good thing. This is not an artificial or candy-like cherry, but a pleasant tart cherry. The wood aging lends itself nicely to the vanilla notes in the background. The mouthfeel shows a modest level of carbonation, as one might expect from a fruit beer. The unique characteristics of this beer truly make it an enigma. The cherries coupled with the wood casks make for a unique beer that can be enjoyed by even non-craft beer drinkers.","JohnnyHopps","Dec 31, 2012"

The taste is also impressive, it's got a blast of tart cherry and citrus upfront that fades into vanilla and some smokey oak flavors. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, it's thin like wine, but also dry. Overall... I'm really impressed, this is a very nice beer.

It has a lot of fruit character and having had a lot of their other fruit beers, smells like a cuvée. The flavors are of sweet cranberry, sweet apple, slight fruity tartness, light buttered apple, and light acidity. It's a lot sweeter than I thought it would be, going into this one blind. It really does taste like a blend of Cranbic, Apple Ale, and Raspberry Tart. It drinks light and has plenty of flavor.

This has all the great qualities New Glarus has conditioned us drinkers to expect from their forays into fruit beer brewing. Distilled down to simplest terms, this beer’s finest quality is a very personal one: everything about it evokes memories of autumns past.

Pours a crystal clear raspberry red color, with absolutely no head. A little odd appearance- I can tell that this is carbonated though, bubbles are coming up from the bottom. Not giving it a great grade for appearance. Smell- leathery and rosy, I also get cinnamon in the nose. A little unexpected. I like the aroma though. Taste- tart cherries, strawberry secondary, cinnamon on the front of the palate, finished by a nice sweet strawberry finish. The play between the fruit and the spice is very subtle, works great together. The carbonation is nice and tight, the finish is dry. This is a very unique and interesting sour ale, I am looking forward to seeing how this one develops over time.","lnashsig","Sep 18, 2012"

I poured it out into a snifter and it poured a cloudy brown. The smell really didn't give me much of a clue as to what it was but it smelled good. Up until now, I didn't have high hopes for this beer. The taste was of slightly sour cherries and butter. I know this sounds strange but it really is good. The sourness is not overdone. I can't think of any beer that I've had that is similar. The name is very appropriate for this beer and I would love to try this one again.","bwmichaud","Nov 20, 2011"

Pours to a one finger thick fizzy head that hangs around for a bit. Very effervescent and bubbly nose. Smell's a bit like carbonated cherries and grapes. The taste...is sublime. There's a slight sour to this, but it's a wonderful fruit beer. The carbonation and slight sour makes your tongue curl. After swallowing, this beer is all smiles. What a fabulous surprise for a person that isn't huge on sour, or huge on fruit. Can't wait to try other New Glarus offerings.","Retail1LO","Aug 17, 2011"

The first smell I am getting from this beer is cranberry along with sour cherries and vanilla. There is also a slight funky vinegar aroma. Taste is slightly sour with cranberry/cherry flavors along with some funk and wood. I see this was fermented with a wild yeast and put in oak casks so that makes sense. A higher level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer from New Glarus.

The flavor hits notes of cherry with a bit of oak and light vanilla. A light touch of acid, though not much. The sourness is mostly confined to the finish. Pretty good, though not as good as their standard fruit offerings.","Thorpe429","May 11, 2011"

Hints of caramel, toffee, biscuit and rye provide complexity and balance to the sweet vinous dark fruit notes. The most prominent fruit flavor is tart dark cherry but there is also subtle grape and plum but this beer is not cloying or too sweet. The malt backbone is stronger than expected and really helps this beer from becoming a cloying mess. Well balanced and easy to drink with a lingering dry, tart finish.","corby112","Jan 23, 2011"

The taste has the fruit characteristics that were seen in the nose but there is a heaving spicing of what appears to be ginger with the strong tart flavor of the fruit.

4.2,1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Review #900! Honestly, during the pre-interview extravaganza, I did not expect to see this gem come through on-tap. I'm glad it did. It pours a mostly clear russet-copper topped by nearly a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises black cherries, cinnamon, nutmeg, dank raspberries, and a kick of oak. The taste is definitely something: raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, red apples, cherries, black grapes, sourdough, rye bread, oak, tobacco, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Whew. It all melds together so nicely that it takes a while to really deconstruct it (and I'm pretty sure I missed something). The body is a hefty medium, with a very-light moderate carbonation and a slightly thick feel. Damn, was this an interesting brew! So many fruits and berries, with some nice spicing as well...it's all quite the adventure. Get some!","TMoney2591","Oct 27, 2010"

Interesting aroma of tart cherries, vanilla, and some sour, funkiness. Already I can tell this is not going to be just another fruity beer. The flavor is complex. Starts off with some sourness but it is not lip puckering tartness. Hints of cherries and vanilla. Acidity is moderately low. This is how I think Wisconsin Belgian Red should taste. Light body and slightly effervescent. Almost has a ginger ale finish. Seems quite suitable for a beer like this. New Glarus unleashed a very interesting, well made beer with Enigma.

Body has a pleasant vanilla, pumpkin, sugary spice, tart fruit blend of flavors and a rather thick, full body with sharp carbonation.

There are some very close competitors (Vinnie @ RR, Patrick @ the Bruery comes very close, a few others) but no one I know can produce the variety of styles Dan has in such a masterful fashion, from German wheats to unbelievable lagers to fruit beers and sours.

I think the older version was more balanced. Not balanced in the sense that the new version doesn't have a nice blend of flavors, but it lends itself more towards the sour side.

The aroma is complex and inviting, smelling intensely of funk and sherry-like oxidation with a backbone of cherries and bourbon. There's a bit of toffee and faint buttery oak as it warms. Tart cherries are surprisingly up-front on the palate for such an old beer. Caramel, bourbon and sherry are equally prominent, leading into a lightly acetic mid-palate with more sweet and tart cherry flavor and a touch of balsamic vinegar.

A bit of bready flavors appear, but are dominated by the cherry. Not a whole lot other than cherries going on in terms of flavor, but I love it. This basically tastes like my grandma's cherry pie.

It pours a very cloudy, dense brownish-red. The aroma is sour cherries, apples, and a little alcohol. The taste is quite similar and the finish is slightly dry. Although, my second tasting (which came quite a while after the first) seemed slightly less sour and slightly more alcohol-y.

Lighter on the apple skins and edging more towards acetone, yet with a pleasing grape must edge. Pours a murky ruddy amber, hazed and rimmed with off-white. On the tongue, a potent kick of sweet acidity. Rich, warm and mouth filling with a Christmas potpourri of tangled florals and perfumes. Lots of fermenting pale fruits over a luscious creamy malt base. The sour notes and wild funk are beautifully blended into the malt character here. First with the bold flow of oaked farm fields and cheese must, then into a creamy grain of roasted caramel and toasted almonds. Sweet and silky. Then out the back door with fading hop presence, maybe more than the style typically brings. On the palate, so airy and mystifying with gentle breezes of sweetness and acidity. Not scorching, yet gentle and calm, with a deft use of wildness to make a very peaceful and enjoyable version.","CharlesDarwin","Mar 07, 2007"

4.32,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Kinda like an Oud Bruin and Kriek blend, however the emphasis is on the sweet, allowing a tart counterpart for balance. The beer shows a pleasent malt sweetness (Brown Ale), but with a tart, candy-like sourness. A cherry aroma helps to solidify the tartness, while adding an added fruit sweetness. An earthy, aged-hop character adds balance to the sweetness and contribues an earthy, dirty complexity. With all this going on, the flavors are well melded and properly aged. A solid malt sweetness wants to play heavy to the mouth, but with the tarness acting as a thinning agent to make the beer very drinkable while adding a mild dryness and astringency late. A cherry flavor persists even after the remaining flavors subside. Unusual flavors, but likable nevertheless.","BEERchitect","Feb 06, 2007"

Where's the sour vinegar funk? Oh, there it is; better late than never. The back of the palate brings out more complexity, with whiskeyish malt, vanilla, oak, toffee, before sourness and acidic flavors takeover the dry finish.

The nose is nice sour cherry, with a very solid oak tannin and a light tartness that adds a nice character to it. The flavor is definately reminding me of the sour brown they made a year or so ago. It has a nice creamy character along with a solid sour cherry in there. It finishes with a very solid tannin character from the oak. It is tasty. The feel is very creamy with moderate body and a light carbonation. It is really smooth. This is a really tasty beer. I think the oak character really sets this one apart from the other NG beers that it is similar to. I will be interested to see if time makes any difference in what this one becomes. I think it is tasty now, and could get even better in time.","kmpitz2","Oct 16, 2006"

Its quite the hybrid stylistically and goes highly recommended to fans of fruit beers, Flemish reds, sour browns, and barrel aged beers alike.","DaPeculierDane","Oct 16, 2006"

4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Drinkability/Overall: the oak aging has done well to smooth out and mellow this beer. Refined, and tight as a knot. This is one to drink AT room temperature as it retains a distracting metallic bite when chilled. Another great cherry beer from the guy who does it best.","Golden2wenty1","Oct 10, 2006"
