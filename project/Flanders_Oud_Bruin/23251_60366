3.78,-0.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"definitely the lighter side of the oud bruin genre, much more lemony lacto than dark malt in here. there is almost no roast character to the grain at all, i taste no chocolate malt either, more like a soured copper ale. smells and tastes about the same, less dynamic or intriguing than the other loverbeer stuff, but loaded with sourness. the oak is there in the nose, but it does little to temper the intense lactic acidity in the swallow. grain profile seems too light for the style, and too light for the texture, its maybe a summer oud bruin, if such a thing exists, but i think it lacks a little depth on the malt front, despite tasting delicious. it really pops on the palate too, effervescent carbonation makes it drink right down. lingering dried fruit and oak on the palate is neat for such a light bodied beer too. definitely the most sour beer ive had from loverbeer, but also the least unique. well made, but there are better examples of the style, especially at this price.","StonedTrippin","Jun 26, 2014"

The oak is very obvious and this is a complex brew, but found it a little too malty and earthy when compared against the best examples of the style. The interesting thing was that despite the earthiness, the beer was still pretty acidic. Odd....anyway, a good beer but probably not worth the steep price.","spoony","Nov 20, 2013"

3.78,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The pour is amber in color with an off-white head. Rather sweet aroma for a sour beer. Lots of berries and grapes with a strange butterscotch sweetness, too. Quite a lot of strawberry flavor on the palate, which is actually enjoyable. Mild to moderate tartness and acidity, a little bit of oak and straw, and very high carbonation. Despite the sweetness of the aroma, I found this to be enjoyable.","womencantsail","Jul 21, 2012"
3.29,-13.2,2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a figgy cherry brown, almost like a diaphonous cola. Little surface foam is light tan and carries little appeal. Nose is dry oak, sour apple, hints of yeast (?) like a French yeast - a bit nutty. Interesting. Up front cherry, moderately tart and slightly sweet. The yeast character is in here as well, kinda suits the sweetness a bit and offers a more complex approach to the style than many Oud Bruin's I've had. Seems to cut the oak dryness and bitterness I sometimes experience and dislike in the style. Full bodied and almost creamy with a slightly dry finish. This is an interesting beer and nice to try.","harrymel","Jul 12, 2012"

The taste is a bit less sour than the smell, a more mild and pleasant version of the lacto funkiness with some berry fruitiness emerging.

The beer actually has considerable sour (at least for me), that marries well with the fruit and wheat flavor I'm picking up. Mouthfeel is fairly light, and drinkability is definitely high. While I wish this beer had a bit more flavor, it's not terrible, and in fact is fairly enjoyable. The low alcohol is a definite bonus.","John_M","Jan 04, 2012"
