Also some nice wood undertones.   Medium mouthfeel with a dry finish.  I'd recommend this to a wine drinker as an avenue into the beer world.  Very good!","SFNC","Mar 25, 2015"

4.4,8.9,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Really starting to dig this style. Poured a dark brown (hint of ruby at the edges), thin ring of off-white head. Classic light vinegar, cherry, sour/lactic undertone, tempting nose... evolved as the bottle warmed up. Tart cherry, fresh but slightly acidic vinegar note, hint of oak. Delicious. Dry finish. Tingly tart small bubbles. Reminiscent of Duchesse or CdJR, but a good deal less intense. Good intro bruin, IMO. Fully enjoyable diversion from the norm. Maybe this will become the new norm.","Mikus","Mar 14, 2015"

Aroma is wine like, with sweet and sour characteristics.   This brew is sweet, to sour, with toffee and tartness rounding out the flavor profile.  There is a pleasant malt flavor throughout, and tartness follows.  The beer finishes clean and mild, easily drank and quite enticing.  Would certainly recommend this beer for personal use or to share with a special someone.","Stinkypuss","Dec 17, 2014"

It lacks the charisma of better examples but still makes for an interesting glass and at 5.5 abv this would be great bottle to bring out to parties, picnics, etc... would revisit this but would not pay much for it. Just read on the label that it is actually a blend of brune and lambic, which explains a lot, and makes me appreciate it a little more. Odd product.","JudgeRoughneck","Mar 06, 2014"

Earthy and tart to me. Those same aromas were reflected in the taste. I like sour beers so I may be partial to this one. It was pretty good.

It pours a deep ruby-sienna topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises spicy red wine grapes (I'm thinking a particularly peppery Tempranillo here), rich caramel, a hint of graham cracker, light plum, mild black cherry, and a feathers' touch of red wine vinegar. The taste brings in more of the same, but whatever tartness was present before has been sanded down to a strong occasional stab adrift in a sea of sweet malts, mild peppery spices, and oxidized sherry. The blend, though, seems to work, leading to a pleasant, easygoing drink that may have been less likely had the tartness retained its former strength. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, a nice bruin, something that doesn't wow or overwhelm, but something that delivers some interesting and unique flavor combinations and an enjoyable time.","TMoney2591","Aug 05, 2013"

Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of sour cherry, raspberry, cranberry, raisin, red wine vinegar, funk, light clove, oak, herbal, caramel, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, raspberry, cranberry, red wine vinegar, oak, clove, light pepper, caramel, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, raspberry, cranberry, red wine vinegar, clove, herbal, pepper, caramel, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Flanders brown ale. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with moderate oak presence; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

4.03,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark candy brown, with a lovely creamy white head that sits at a finger’s width above the beer. In the light and in the glass, though, the beer is beautifully dark ruby in color, with some slight muddling in the color to suggest brown maple syrup. Lacing is thin and tendril like along the walls of the glass. The body appears to be clean and free of particles, but is really quite opaque to the eye. On the nose, the beer smells strongly of cherry leather and funk, with big fruity waftings and a light barnyard funk lying beneath everything that just barely touches upon less appealing smells. The smell actually begins with a nice malty base, but that is swiftly washed away by the funk and fruit. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart with wonderfully fruity notes that move mostly in the tart cherry range, but do hint slightly at other fruits. The funk detected in the nose is lighter in the taste, but still present in the background of flavor. The beer begins with light funk before quickly opening into sweet fruity cherry notes with some mild leather to suggest the funkier side of the beer. The finish mingles light funk and fruit beautifully, and the aftertaste rings with a surprisingly salty sour funk, while still hinting at the cool fruity cherry. In the mouth, the beer feels light to medium in body, with some fierce prickling from the carbonation, though it remains smooth other than that. The mouth is left neutral, with only the slightest watering at the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a lovely light wild beer. It tends more towards the fruity side of the road, but suggests some nice funk notes while still holding onto the fruit. The beer is a terrific introduction beer for wild ales, and a nice fruity beverage overall. I like this beer.","Maxwell","Jan 06, 2013"

Tartness is noticeable in the aroma, which smells of weak apple cider vinegar. I actually wish it was a bit bolder; as is, it's just ok. The sourness is immediately present on the front end, though it is not terribly strong in and of itself. There simply isn't much else present for it to contest with, outside of the carbonation and some mild yeastiness. Some malt sweetness finally makes its way through in the finish, well after the tartness has subsided. Grapefruit and apple notes lurk somewhere in the transition between the two. All in all, this is a fairly mild and drinkable bruin that doesn't stand out in any particular aspect.","MaximalC","Aug 30, 2012"

Taste mirrors nose, but the blending leads me to believe this is far more lager than lambic,, not exactly what I was looking for but certainly a good idea from a business perspective. Mild tartness and even milder sourness due to caramel malt. Mouthfeel is medium, low effervescence, a bit of stickiness.

Drying on the finish with some tannins, lactic sourness and a little balsalmic vinegar, this beer also has characteristics of oxidized malt, with a little must. The cocoa I picked out on the nose isn't really noticeable.

The flavor, however, is distracting with its beautiful juxtaposition of sour apple/mild citrus-like tartness and lightly sweet, caramelish, and toasty malt. Raisins and brown sugar appear along the way; and a thin spritz of lemon juice hits you at the finish, drying it nicely! It lingers in the mouth though, with a film of dry maltiness that makes you want to take another sip! Quite nice. And although it's not complex, the combination of the sourness and sweetness is interesting enough to keep you coming back for more!

My friend got this in 03' from Michael Jackson Belgium beer club and the best before date was 12/21/02.","kennyo","Nov 20, 2004"
3.29,-18.6,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I thought I had finished all of my bottles of this beer off a year ago. I seem to remember it tasting better than this. Foamy head that died quickly. Kind of a sour smell. Kind of tastes like a burgundy wine. Maybe this one has sat too long.The date on the bottle is 12/20/02 and today is 8/15/04. So its quite possible that this beer has not improved with age. I will have to pick up another bottle sometime and edit htis review if my impressions change.","Hex92","Aug 15, 2004"
4.18,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I love the way a good Flemish Ale looks. This is ruby brown in color, though it does not have much head. There is no hop aroma to speak. The aroma is not much, but you can tell that it is sweet and tart. It tastes fruity and winey and is acidic and sour with a slight bitter finish. There is plenty of carbonation I guess I just poured it bad.","ark57","Feb 27, 2004"
3.45,-14.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I will have to say that I wasn't very impressed with this beer. It poured nice and dark brown but had almost know head at all. Very little carbonation at all. It has a nice aroma that is malty and smells of plums. But the taste was extremely sweet. It had a big plum taste with very little bitterness at all. The big turn off was the residual sweetness which overpowered everything else. Overall I think that it may have not have finished fermenting, but otherwise was interesting.","Elemental","Feb 12, 2004"
4.62,14.4,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,5,"This brown has an absolutely exceptional aroma. Its complex fruity sourness is interesting and refreshing, and evolves nicely as it warms. It's refreshing, fruity, and complexly delicious, and I'll definitely be picking up more bottles of this.","Stopper","Nov 13, 2003"
4.17,3.2,3.5,4,4,4,5,"Hazy deep garnet in hue. Lanky, yet persistent tan head yields sparse lace. Candied green apple upfront in aroma is complemented by slightly sour, oaky balsamic notes. Tartness dissapates rapidly as the brew breathes, and is replaced by a static, sweet raisin and caramel presence. Brusque snap of toffee like, dark candi sugar sweetness initially in flavor is quickly offset by a melange of stately acetic tartness, earthy tones of hay, and mellow yeast must. Fruitiness is of an underripe, slightly astringent plum like nature. Appropriately lightly bodied and thus conducive to quaffability, with a agreeable dextrinous kiss in mouthfeel. Notes of grape skin emerge late, thoroughly drying the palate, yet a smidgen of molasses like residual sweetness remains. Finishes softly bready, with a sourdough like lactic mirk. Quite an enjoyable, whimsical brew. Superbly refreshing and certainly quite a tease in its eight ounce portion. This is what Liefman's Oud Bruin failed to be.

4.1,1.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Notes: A good beer, if you like the style. The taster needs to have an awareness of the sourness of this style, or else weird faces will appear. It's hard to believe how refreshing something sour can actually be. Very appropriate for it's style.","beerinator","Aug 10, 2003"
4.33,7.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown in color with a bit of sediment and a thin, light tan head. The aroma is appropriately sour, with some sugary malty notes undrelying and a bit of a nutty scent. The taste is tart but not overwhelmingly so. The tartness starts of gently, gives way to a malty sweetness, reasserts itself in a finish reminiscent of raisins and green apples and finally yields to a mildly sweet aftertaste. Medium-bodied, much lighter than it looks, with a gently dry finish. Very drinkable -- a good introduction to the world of sour beers.","mzwolinski","Feb 25, 2003"

4.05,0.2,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a clear dark red/brown with a smallish off white head. It has a slightly malty somewhat citrusy smell that gives the perception of sweet and sour. The taste was of a sweet flowery front, diminishing sour mid with a dry slightly yogurty end and a slightly thin mouthfeel. Overall it was a very nice sweet and sour type beer which I really wish I could drink on a more regular basis.","fattyre","Feb 20, 2003"

3.95,-2.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark garnet color with a pertinent head and the lace formed is a fine sheet to coat the glass. The aroma of fresh ripe plums, malt and somewhat musty, light nut sweetness also present a pleasure to sniff. Start is sweet and malt laden, the top is a bit thin, and the finish nicely carbonated and the hops apropos for the style. The aftertaste dry and somewhat sour, good drinkable beer and well worth the sample.","Gusler","Dec 20, 2002"
4.05,0.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: A happy brew in my mouth, back and forth complexities of tartness and carob or dark malt. Pleasing to the palate and refreshed my mind.","Jason","Apr 16, 2002"
