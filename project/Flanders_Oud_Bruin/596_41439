3.38,-10.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"22 ounce bottle acquired in a trade a while back with hoppymeal, thanks again for sending me the wants item Derek, drank tonight from my Maerlant tulip glass, color is a dark red mixed with a soft brown, two inch creamy beige head, some retention retention at first but minimal lacing, aroma conists of tartiness, cherries, vinegar, oak, caramel malts, light toffee, red wine, and grassy accents, flavor starts off with an aggressive sourness, some vinegar and oak in the middle, finish has a good amount of earthiness and lingering sweetness from different malts, tartiness tames a little as it warms but more vinegar comes along with that, sweet vinegar unlike other brews I have experienced in the past where they were overly sour, decent brew but needs more complexity, tart, sour, and full of berries in the mouthfeel, light to medium bodied, moderate to high level of carbonation, taste does not last long, could drink a good amount of this stuff, went down easy at first but gets a little vinegary later on, not overly sour or anything though, only other beer I have had from the brewery that produces the tasty Kate the Great, it was neither a disappointment or a letdown, pretty average and what I was expecting, might drink again, worth trying","Floydster","Jun 02, 2009"
3.03,-20.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle sampled at PPRBSG09. This beer pours brown with a small head. The aroma is largely of sour yogurt. The flavor is also rather yogurty as well as lactic. I don't detect a malt backbone at all. Overall, I really didn't like this one much...","LilBeerDoctor","Oct 02, 2008"

3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The minute this stuff hits your tongue you feel the sourness. Even before your taste buds kick in, your tongue is telling you that its something special. Its a nice tart dry taste along with enough sweetness to balance it perfectly. It has some citrus tastes to it and the same response from my mouth as when I drink real grapefruit juice. It also has a similarity to a red wine. This is by no means a strong beer despite its complexity. Its very, very drinkable.","indiapaleale","Mar 26, 2008"

4.18,10.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A sour brown from Portsmouth? Upon hearing about it, I knew I had to try it, and a trip up to visit the family for Easter was a perfect opportunity. The beer pours a fairly clear light brown/amber color with a thin, quickly-dissipating head. Smell is tart, with some hints of vinegar and sourness to it, a bit of cherry as well. Taste is where this brew shines though, but only if you like sour brews. If you don't like sour beers, you probably won't enjoy this one. Taste is sour, with hints of cherry and other fruit present. A bit of sweetness from the malt counters. The most fascinating part to me was the hint of hop I got from time to time. It wasn't on every sip, but a few sips I would catch a couple notes of a citric hoppiness - and I can say hops, because it had that distinctive flavor that only hops can give, it wasn't due to the sourness. It was fascinating, and made the beer even better than it already was. Carbonation was lively and good, and the it drank smooth, with a nice crisp finish. I could definitely put down a few of these in a night, though with most sour beers, they can get to be a little much too quickly. I'd say this is similar to a Rodenbach in many respects - different taste, but still quite good. Very enjoyable, and another winner from Portsmouth.","YonderWanderer","Mar 11, 2008"

1.22,-67.8,3,1,1,2,1,"D-I just could not bring myself to finish this beer. I think its great that brewers dig up recipes from around the world and give them a try. This just does not taste good at all. Way too sour, way to acidic. Way to funky. This beer should probably be a fruit and veggie beer. This just can't be a brown ale. I think cherry stems are used in making brune. I am not sure about this.","jneiswender","Beers"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Bartender said this was worth a try, that it was a brown ale brewed with a sour mash. Pretty good beer. It was a hazy red/brown color with a small head that dissipated quickly. It had a sweet, sugary aroma. The taste was reminiscent of those hard sour candies I used to eat. Nice pucker factor, not too sour. Had a couple of these and enjoyed them.","lordofthewiens","0"
