I can't be sure the metallic flavor has completely fallen off (hard to be objective when I know how pronounced that flavor was when the beer was fresh) but at a minimum, it's dramatically reduced. This is starting to feel more like a good example of the style rather than an average-to-mediocre one.","HowardTheDuck","Mar 17, 2015"

2.6,-33.7,,,,,,"Has a distinctive malt foundation which goes side by side with slightly sour, fermented grapes. Acidity remains restrained, adding a gentle, tingling bite to the fruit, while a dry citraic note enhances the brews complexity. Then, earthy, musty malts take over, while a sweet note of fruit sugar and toffee gets introduced. This maltiness overpowers the much more interesting sour aspect of the beer, leading to a smooth mouthfeel, which finishes very soft, with an underlying earthy sweetness. Nose basically reflects the taste, this is a little too honest for a Flanders Red Ale. While the heavy malts focus by itself could actually lead to an interesting new interpretation of this style, it has to interact properly with the sour, fruity ingredients to create an exiting complexity.","aleigator","Beers"

Some tangy lacto character along with rich malts which bring on some mild woodiness and a hint of caramel. Some faint cherry in the background as well. This brew isn't very aromatic, the nose is quite delicate. Taste is fruity up front with more green apple and cherry with hints towards tartness but no real sour bite. The fruit character gives way to a pretty complex malt bill. The finish throws me off a bit. I don't want to call it metallic but it seems to head in that direction. Something just isn't jiving on the finish. Hopefully this is something that could develop with age into a cleaner finish. Mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation for the style. Overall, I was really hoping for better things with this brew. This beer is still a great value, but it just is a little on the mild side.","homebrew311","Jul 23, 2014"

However, I would really have loved for this to be a bit more sour. I was hoping it would evolve into a more sour brew over time, but that hope was dashed when I learned the beer had been flash pasteurized. Although this beer is certainly decent, it makes me a bit nervous to think that this may be the base for all the fruited sours coming out of the wild sour cave. I was expecting another home run, and instead I would say this is a solid double.","thebigredone","Jul 12, 2014"

I was sort of expecting a crisp, refreshing, bright sour like Wild Sour, but this is different; this isn't mostly tart sourness delight, it's sourness on top of malt on top of floral hops, blended with oak. This is masterfully done and to say it's "complex" is an understatement. I can't wait to see how this one ages.","TheSSG","Jul 12, 2014"

Dark fruits, oak barrel, and distressed leather give the beer deep complexity while it's lighter body makes for an easily drinkable brew that can be explored pint after pint.","BeerFMAndy","0"
