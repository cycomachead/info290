3.34,-0.6,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"O: I found myself surpsised with this beer twice. At first I was surprised at the level of funk presence in both the aroma and taste. This was a disappointing surpsise. As I sipped through, I was equally surprised at how this beer grew on me. I would not say it overwhelms on any level. I will say that it is very drinkable, and one that I ended up enjoying quite a bit.","roger617","0"
