I often find the acidity overtakes this style, but the sourness is mild and balanced by fruitiness and caramel sweetness in this beer. Probably the best beer I've had of this style.","coreyfmcdonald","Beers"

3.88,-7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pour yields a dark reddish-amber-brown brew with a thin head. Light lacing as it went down. The nose has a good amount of cherry plus some light acid. Mild bread character. The flavor brings some nice lightly-sweet malt plus cherry, dark fruits, oak, and a bit of sourness. Light acetic character, though mostly lactic. Oak in the background. The fruit is a nice touch. Medium body with a good sourness that melds well with all the other flavors. A solid brew for sure.","Thorpe429","Jan 29, 2011"
4.5,7.9,4,4,5,4,4.5,"On tap at One Funky Afternoon. 2008 version. A whop in the nose with tart cherries and old funk. Color is a deep mahogany, very slick looking with minimal head and lacing. Cant get over the smell, very rustic and mature. The taste is superb, very complex with layers of chocolate and tart cherries, the sour unravels into a deep heavenly experience. Wish they had bottled this one for the release.","Tripphop","Jan 25, 2011"

3.75,-10.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D - Pretty interesting sour beer with a distinct herbal character, though I'm still on the fence with this one. I enjoyed the chocolate character and the tartness, but at times the herbal attributes we are bit harsh and the dryness overpowering.","ffejherb","Aug 23, 2010"
3.98,-4.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Medium bodied with a good amount of puckering, funky dry Brett up front that is quickly countered by the rich chocolate malt, earthy oak and vinous dark fruit. Puckering at first but not acidic at all. Again, the malt presence is stronger than anticipated but it provides a nice silky chocolate, toffee, hazelnut presence that counters the dry Brett, earthy oak and tart dark berries. The barrel aging and cherries added provide a vinous note with hints of grape, tart dark cherries, plum and raisin. Slight vinegar flavors adds a slight sour character to the finish but this beer is well balanced and very quaffable.","corby112","Jul 22, 2010"

Among the 'rarer' beer I've enjoyed in a while (both style-wise AND distribution-wise - SEVENTY-TWO BOTTLES? sheesh) and certainly one I'd want to repeat; again, huge thanks to Sam.","msubulldog25","Dec 23, 2009"
3.99,-4.3,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"D - Drinkability is pretty good. The alcohol is almost completely masked which get points in my book. The oak is prominent and done well. The idea of an organic brown gone sour makes for a good brew. That being said, carbonation. Just not enough in this bottle and that takes away from what would have been a great score. Even a little more suds would greatly improve it. This is still a solid brew from a solid brewery. I'm gonna go ahead and recommend it.","csmiley","Nov 08, 2009"
4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The cherry flavor nearly mirrors the aroma, though the tartness seems more cherry skin derived. Notes of wood and barrel tannins are evident. There's a low sweetness and a light roast. The finish is tart cherry skins with oak. Alcohol is well hidden.","HopHead84","Oct 20, 2009"
4.67,12,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer...and one I'm glad Jackie-O's has created...it is in the style, and tastes wonderful. The high ABV is masked by the potent flavors here, making this a dangerously drinkable beer. Would have loved to bring home a growler, but this is one they are saving for just the bar.

Tempting to get a growler of it, but I don't know if my tongue could handle that much sourness.","beveritt","0"
