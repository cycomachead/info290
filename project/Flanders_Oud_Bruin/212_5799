Nose is vibrant with black cherry and dark fruits.  Some treacle and a good little hint of something sour.  Taste is rich and crisp malt.  Lots of layers to this one.  Dark fruits, a touch of spice and that treacle.  This has a slight hop bitter that comes to the tongue just as the small pucker from sour kicks in and your mouth starts to really water.  This finishes dry and with a big juiciness. Medium mouthfeel.","utopiajane","Feb 17, 2015"

Taste: cranberry-raspberry blend, brown sugar, herbal with woody and green apple candy notes in the finish.

The flavors are more earthy, and the dark sugar dominates. The balance and mouthfeel are right where they should be, and it's quite easy to drink, but would be helped by some more complexity of flavors.

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This dark brown beer has a poorly retained neck (the style expects more retention). The aroma brings cherries, peppery tones, and molasses - and wood-like tones. The malt, both in aroma and taste, should be more pronounced, here expressed as toffee. The aroma expressed well the acidity, and, despite the aging of 2.5 years, no vinegar notes. The cheeriness is expressed both in aroma and taste, and is very pleasant. The body is medium, super carbonated, oily, and smooth. The end is acid, pleasant, but brief.","HabiMendes","Apr 01, 2013"

Aroma a hint of dark roasted malt character with underlying sliced apple fruit notes, with a lingering acidity noted in each sip. Flavor is outstanding absolutely nice and refreshing oud bruin, not up to the level of Goudenband but damn tasty. Roasted malts come across initially followed by a light acidity and tart apple and pear combob, minimal yogurt zing to it. Not as wild or barnyard as some of the Belgian wild ales I've come across. Mouthfeel finishes dry nicely acidic clean fruitiness enough sweetness to balance it out, carbonation is bubbly cleanses the palate with each sip.

Taste is light vinegar/sourness up front with definite cherry and tannic undertones. All of the flavours quickly vanish, leaving a finish that is very crisp, with little aftertaste aside from something that hints at red wine.

There is a tingle from the carbonation and the sour notes play on the tongue adding to the tingling sensation. Light to medium-bodied this is a beer for you sour beer lovers out there, but if you're looking for major pucker this one won't supply it.

Nice sweet/sour balance, with stonefruits, toasted/caramel malts, and a light, but surprising green hop flavor on top of a light and dry, almost tannic body, with a nice carbonic tingle. Very easy to drink, and would make a painless introduction for those leery of sour reds, but I don't feel it is to style - it almost tastes like a red ale that has had lactic acid added to it or has been mildly soured and then pasteurized.

But as far as I know most barrels used in this kind of procedure are up to 100 years old. The sore thumb that this shows actually winds up blending in quite nicely a ways into the bottle.

Not bad, I think some stinky cheese and crusty bread would compliment this selection well. Worth a try. Good gateway sour/Belgian red.","Billolick","Feb 21, 2010"
3.48,-6.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"There is quite a nice mix of flavors to this beer, but it really has just been watered down too much. A more concentrated version would likely be phenomenal & for this reason I find this beer quite disappointing.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

2.62,-29.4,3,3.5,2,2,3,"Overall, quite a disappointment. There are far better examples of the style for a similar price, notably "Duchesse" and Rodenbach. Extraordinarily boring in most every way.","phisig137","Dec 03, 2009"

3.3,-11.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"On tap at the Cheeky Monk in Denver. Clear dark red color with a small off-white head. Aroma is both sweet and sour with cherry, apple, oak, and mild funk. Flavor is a tiny bit tart but mostly just sweet, with cherry, apple, sweet malt, and a metallic, acidic finish. The description calls this "wine-like?" Not very accurate. Body is medium-light with moderately high carbonation. Drinkability average-plus, but the metallic flavor hurts it here. Not a huge fan overall.","nickd717","Jul 21, 2009"
4.29,15.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D = This is a very good drinkable beer, sour, but not so much as to be astringent, with good fruitiness of character.","Traquairlover","Jul 13, 2009"
3.48,-6.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D- This would be more drinkable if it had a little more carbonation to it. Overall not the worst beer in this style but far from the best.","alleykatking","Jun 07, 2009"

3.13,-15.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Light body, smooth and easy to drink. Overall, an average beer, but I have had better and I expected a lot more from this beer. I would probably give it a shot if I found in a bottle.","PhillyStyle","Feb 10, 2009"
3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a less intense version of a sour red. It has a brownish amber color to it, a sweet berry maltiness, and carmelized malts. Like drinking caramel strawberries. The intensity of the sourness is low on this one, but it's there. A good beer of its style for the beginner, but still solid for the veteran to appreciate.","DoubleJ","Jan 04, 2009"

Still not bad.","illidurit","Nov 22, 2008"

4.2,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at Stone World Bistro & Gardens. I had this back to back with a Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour. Both had about the same fruitiness to them, but this Bacchus had a slightly more sharp sourness whereas the Monk's Cafe was more muted in that respect. I think the Bacchus also had a somewhat lighter body and the Monk's felt a bit more soft.","MiScusi","Dec 08, 2007"

3.47,-6.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear red colored beer with a small head that quickly disappeared. Aroma of oak is clearly present thought not has much as in other example such as Rodenbach. Taste is slightly tart with some nice touch of oak and very subtle cheery. Probably of the best effort from this brewery.","Phyl21ca","Sep 11, 2002"
3.12,-15.9,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Interestingly, the Russian translation of the label declares this a "pale" beer. Not likely. Deep mahogany red that is remarkably clear for an unfiltered beer. The head was very fizzy and so short lived I didn't even get a chance to notice the color. My guess, based on the collar that still sits above the liquid, would be reddish tan. The nose is full of cherry. The mouth is very carbonated and heavy with fruit sweetness. The cherry attacks the tastebuds immediately, hitting with both sweet and sour. Malt lurks somewhere in the background, but never overcomes the fruit. The aftertaste is clearly sour cherry. Not bad, if this is what you like. I don't, particularly.","Globetrotter","Beers"
3.8,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Quite a refreshing ale, sweetish start, with a tart sourness towards the finish, as always a cherry-ish flavour and slight caramel maltyness, enjoyable flanders red, even though its not the best.","rastaman","0"
