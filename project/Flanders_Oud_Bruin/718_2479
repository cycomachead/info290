3.52,-4.3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Finishing off my day at Firkin by revisiting a beer I vaguely remember trying way back in my NoVa days.  It pours a clear midnight tawny topped by a finger or so of dark khaki foam.  The nose basically reminds me of a jar (if one were to exist, of course) of maple syrup-laden malt vinegar.  The taste flips things a bit, having some tart vinegar tinging dry maple syrup, with a touch of muted brine making a brief cameo near the beginning of the finish.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, an odd beer, really, what with its inability to decide on a flavor path (vinegar-leaning or maltily sweet), but it still retains its drinkability.","TMoney2591","Beers"

A very welcome and unique departure from the usual of IPA's, stouts, and pale ales. Definitely worth a try.","yannimou","Oct 10, 2014"

3.92,6.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.75,"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Deep reddish brown, mahogany tints to the light. Beige froth shows nice retention & lacing. Oak, sour berry & grape aromas, tartar hues & slight sweetness. Tartar/sourness, fruity & woody notes over toasted malts on the forefront. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Silky palate, dense to watery texture. As expected from aromas, harsh tartiness remains in the middle & lingers into the finish. Thankfully, toasted maltiness holds it, making it refreshing instead of bothering. Grape & wood on the aftertaste. Sometimes I wonder if it is a malty wine –just kidding!, it´s a good job & nice spot of the Style. Suggested pairing with heavy spiced cooked beef meat.","GONZALOYANNA","Apr 10, 2014"

3.89,5.7,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of the style, since this is my first Oud Bruin I'm not very familiar with this style, but this beer seems to be pretty in line with the description of the style on BeerAdvocate, but I think I'll have to revisit this beer once I try more of the style to get a better idea of where it stands. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not too acidic, not too filling, a little refreshing, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these and I think it would be a nice beer to enjoy in the summer. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, I thought it was very nice and I really liked how fruity and sour it was. What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste wasn't more like the aroma, I wish that intensity that I got in the aroma showed up in the taste. I would buy this beer again, I enjoyed it and it's priced pretty reasonably especially for a Belgian beer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fruity and tart beers. All in all i thought this was pretty solid, it's not the best sour and fruity beer I have had, but it was good for what it is and I thought it had pretty good drinkability. I'm glad i took a chance on this beer and I'll be on the look out for more Oud Bruins and more Petrus beers. Nice job guys, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Jan 21, 2014"

3.68,0,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/3/2013. Pours lightly hazy very dark ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grape, pear, apple, raisin, cherry, oak, clove, red wine, vinegar, herbal, hay, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of fruity/funky yeast and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of grape, pear, apple, cherry, raisin, red wine, vinegar, oak, musty funk, herbal, hay, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cherry, raisin, red wine, vinegar, musty funk, oak, hay, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast flavors; with decent flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Flanders brown. Nice balance/complexity and decent robustness of yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 05, 2013"

The first thing to notice is how it lacks the intense, smacking tart of their pale - not wrong to compare, as the (yeast-)flavor profile is certainly similar.... Even as you let this sit and sit, the aromas and flavors merely suggest oxidation and subtle lacto-tartness - nothing hits you over the head, no watering of the mouth.... In fact, this drinks with very much reduced (in this case, sour-cherry) fruitiness / maltiness to balance compared to other popular takes on the style.... Makes this a little less dimensional - it faintly fills on intake, feathery not dirty-silky, only to fade immediately, dry with only a delicate touch of malt in the finish....

Aromas of dates, leather, raisin, and peat. Good earthy and sweet nose. Flavors are rich and layered, with a mocha coffee backbone giving rise to some slightly sour currant and wine-like characteristics. Tangy, old world fruit characters highlight the brew, such as plum, fig, and raisin. The light body and carbonation keep the beer crisp, and avoid the cloying mouthfeel. The aftertaste is a dark, rich sweetness with a subtle sour tang. Clean, slightly astringent finish that gives a touch of pucker in mouth. Good, easy to drink beer.

All I can really pick up are slightly roasted malts and the interesting creamy sour sweetness typical for the style. I guess you could say some dark hard candy as well. It's not exactly a standout. The flavor too features the slight roast upfront then goes into a candied dark fruit sweetness with an ever so slight tartness. I prefer more acidity. It's also not very complex. It drinks medium in body but this beer doesn't really offer a whole lot for the style. The flavors are subtle and the sweetness is featured a little more than other Oud Bruins. This beer is a nice starting point for the style but not really worth it otherwise in my opinion.","aasher","Nov 30, 2011"

3.65,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"11.2oz. bottle served in my Weyerbacher tulip. Pours a deep, translucent mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that dissipates into a soapy skim and a frothy band around the edges. Nose expresses cider vinegar, oak, tannins, a vinous quality and a suggestion of vanilla. Elements of the nose are also expressed in the flavor profile; however, everything comes off a bit watered down. There's also a hint of oxidation; however, it's not at all unpleasant. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation, some acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and a semi-dry finish. However, the overall impression comes off somewhat thin. All and all this beer is a somewhat lackluster example of an Oud Bruin. Not bad, but really missing the body and complexity I've come to associate with the style.","Jwale73","Oct 17, 2011"

4.08,10.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Oak cask and lactic sourness build a delicious aroma above the dark ruby-brown draught. Grape, juice is the dominant fruit, and a little horse blanket rounds out the funkworks here, also caramel makes an appearance. Diacetyls lend a slippery mouthfeel, which is aided by a nice medium bodied backbone.

3.47,-5.7,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Pours a brown color that resembles dark root beer. A light beige head tops the beer and recedes leaving slightly above average lacing. Smells of sour tart fruit highlighted a very slight oak note. First sip is a tad disappointing as there was more sour tartness in the nose than in the taste. There’s a bunch of dark fruits and cherries here. Surprisingly there is not as much oak at all and certainly not for a beer aged in oak barrels for 20 months. Roasted malts dominate the flavor when preferably it should be tart fruits and oak. Tastes watered-down even though it is well carbonated.","ATLbeerDog","Sep 29, 2011"
3.39,-7.9,3.5,4.5,2.5,4,3.5,"Pours a murky cranberry-brown color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour fruit, balsalmic vinegar, funk, and some wood aromas. This beer smells very good. Unfortunately, the taste is nowhere near as good as the smell. There are some watery sour fruit flavors and only minor funk and vinegar flavors. I am pretty surprised and bummed out because of this. There is a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel.

Feel is fairly light, syrupy, and sweet/sour. Not much in the sour department though. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, it just doesn't live up to the style for me.

The aroma brings a nice malty apple vinegar. The tongue gets a moderate sour bite of more vinegar malt with a subtle touch of milk chocolate. There’s some hint of cherry as well. This mellows into a nice old ale, but not one of those "off the charts" tongue twisters. Not a power pucker.

Some maroon spots with red showing towards the side. A nice sturdy dirty tan head billows above, ok lace. This bruin does not smell overly sweet and vinegar laden, thank god. I get big time cherry and plum, other dark fruits. Comes off vinious. Taste is superb, a great mix, starts off mildly sweet going into a slight sour twist with a aftertaste of cherry. Oak does not come out that much, and this spent like 30 months in the dark, that will tell you how fruit forward this is. Feel is a bit of a let down. While light bodied and easily drinkable, the finish comes off a bit rusty and bumpy, leaving a semi metallic taste afterwards, which is strange. All in all another drinkable beer from the boys at Bavik/Petrus. I expect them to send a ton of this to Philly as they did with the aged pale, they literally flooded the market with that one.

The carbonation is moderate, the body a little thin, and it finishes with some lingering fruitiness.

It smells a bit like a vinegary small brown ale, which I guess it is, but it doesn't pull it off quite well enough. The aroma is interesting but a bit thin and acrid. There are some interesting fruit notes in it and some malt nuttiness, but I much prefer the flavor. The flavor is surprisingly refreshing. It's sweet and sour with a bit caramelized malt.

As the drink flattens, the sour tone is enhanced, and the beer begins to resemble a red wine that has started to turn (but in a good way).

The flavors have a little more character to it than the nose did, nice malt, some fruit like flavor, maybe some wood like flavors as well. What I really like is the sourness, which is persistent but in no way overwhelming, gives this brew a real nice flavor that mixes well with the other favors listed.

This is one of those beers; looking at the label, one might expect an oak aged dubbel or brown ale, but instead you have what amounts to a Flanders sour ale. If youre not familiar with the Oud Bruin style, you will be surprised. Actually as I have learned, the Oud Bruin style is a brown, not red Flanders ale, a slight distinction that makes more sense once you actually taste the beer. Once you figure out what youre drinking (I was seriously thrown a curve by the tartness), you can enjoy this brew. My suggestion is to serve it cool, not cold; its complexities really dont unravel until it warms even further than the suggested 50F. Otherwise, its a pretty decent sour ale, though too pricy for regular enjoyment.","jettjon","Jul 27, 2007"

Toasted, slightly biscuity malts ensue, with some definite sour cherries. A hint of metal, oak, and smoke in an otherwise acidic, mildly tart, vinegary finish. Moderate to light bodied ale with zesty carbonation. I haven't had many examples of this style, but this seems like a good iteration.

3.71,0.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"33 cL bottle with no freshness date, brought home from the Capital Ale House in Richmond. It pours a lightly hazy rusty/copper that thins at the bottom of the flute, and it has medium carbonation that leads up to an inch of tan head that never fully recedes and leaves nice sheets of lacing. The bouquet is sweet and tart/sour with hints of oak and mustiness. It isn't as tart on the palate as the aroma led me to believe, but it has some sourness with notes of sweet malts, leafy/green hops, and hints of red berries. The body is light at first, but becomes medium, with tingly carbonation, dryness from the tannins, and a medium to light finish. Not too bad, but as far as sour ales go, it is quite mellow - I wish it had more sourness on the palate, and that it were more robust in aroma and flavor.","mmmbeer","Feb 06, 2007"

The head was thick and just slightly off-white, as if a hint of gray was desperately trying to be noticed. A sweet, fruity aroma with a hint of malt awakened my nose as I leaned forward to sniff the brew. The tartness of bright cherries make me take serious notice as the first sip rested on my tongue. This is unlike any beer I've ever tasted, and I think I like it! So different, yet so delightful. I also appreciate the smooth, creamy texture, and the way the flavor lingers for quite some time.

There's a bit of malt noticable, but it really isn't very prominent and I don't taste the hops in there at all. Seems to be a slight alcohol taste, not in a bad way, though I didn't know this beer was only %5.5 ABV. Hmmm. Very watery and light mouthfeel. This beer definately challenges my definition of beer and my impression of what a beer should be. There really are a vast array of styles out there, and this one is pretty new to me.

Hints of caramel too. The taste confirms this first perception. Oud bruin it is, but somehow subdued or attenuated. The winy oaky tart aspect doesnt punch you in the face, it kisses you on the lips. The finish is a bit sharper, but still very balanced. Some biscuity and even chocolaty notes appear. Maybe a hint of sweet fried plantain at one point, with a candy like sweetness. The light soda taste reminds me a Belgian stout. Hops get noticeable if you think about them, adding some thickness, but no strong bitterness.

I've never seen anything like this before, there were even no bubbles around the edge. Smell was slightly tart, I struggled to pick up any other details. Initial taste was what a suspected a slight tartness surrounded by a sweet nutty maltiness. Very refreshing.

Wow, this beer is not what I expected it all, it almost has the tartness of a lambic. Its nice and tart, with a sour cherry taste, accompanied by a bit of an earthy flavor. The finish is a sprinkling of a dull, spicy hop and woodiness. The mouthfeel is light and slick with very subtle carbonation. I enjoy these particular flavors a lot in beer so Im a fan of this one.

Initially there is a burst of sweet vinous grapes and cherries with just a tiny hint of tannins. Following this brew takes a turn towards being decently pungent, tart, and sour, with a slight oak tone in the mix, and a hint of vanilla. The finish is somewhat sweet, with a slight spice, a bit of malt, a strong grape like flavor and a slight sourness right at the end. There is also a warm finishing alcohol tone.

The body is a deep murky walnut colour, but when held up to direct light it transforms into a stunning clear cherry oak hue, an absolutely enchanting work of alchemy. Sour cherry immdeiately hits me from the aroma, dates and currents and a vinuous quality to it. Malty dried fruit appear first in the flavour, but is soon overtaken by an undercurrent of sour cherry all the way to the finish, where a more black current flavour rounds out on the aftertaste, rounding the edges of the sharp acidity. Light creamy mouthfeel, but the jaggedness of the acidity doesn't appeal to me that much, I can now see how a wine glass may be more ideal to serve this in for more than one reason. Would make a lovely after dinner drink, but I couldn't see having more than one in any sitting. Even the 250 ml serving seems a little much for me.

Almost like opening a big bag of "Sour Patch Kids" at the movie theatre. Sweet, malty and a touch sour in the taste. The faintest taste of a mineral based water in there, too. The aroma's definitely bigger on the sour note than the taste. Oak barrel aging is most prevalent. Oak is pourous and allows oxygen to pass through which "in essence" adversely affects beer in a negatively way. It subsequentially creates lactic acid, which could be a serious off-flavor in most beers, but a Flemish Brown/Red is supposed to be this way. This example is a close-to-perfect style of this beer.

Snap of acetic tartness initially in flavor softens abruptly, and couples with caramelized, dark candi sugar sweetness to lend a gentle, sweetsour citric character. Understated notes of dry cocoa and raisin surface mid palate, bolstering malt and fruit character, respectively. Lightly bodied overall, but sufficiently dextrinous in mouthfeel to lend an agreeably soft mouthfeel. Finishes slightly savory, with fleeting notes of wood and salt.

Malt is in back but provides a nice sweet balance to the sourness.  Surprisingly the oak character doesn’t come through a lot, not nearly as much as rodenbach.  A very nice and drinkable sour brown.","nathi","Oct 24, 2002"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The sour/tart character of this beer might not appeal to everyone, but I found it a great change of pace for a late evening sipper.  The 8.5 oz. bottle is kind of small, but for this beer it is appropriate, as it is not something you would want to drink in bulk - this is a beer to sip and savor.","Brent","Oct 23, 2002"
3.65,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"This is not like any brown from the States.  Good carbonation and head, deep ruby red color.  Its aged 2 years in oak casks  and this must give it the sweet/sour viney taste.  Tiny bottle - 8.4oz for $2.69.","jdhilt","Aug 17, 2002"
2.83,-23.1,3.5,3,2.5,4,2.5,"Overall, this beer strikes me a a bit unbalanced on the sour side.  The contrast between sweet malt and sour esters can be pleasant, but here detracted from the overall drinking experience.","mzwolinski","May 05, 2002"
4.15,12.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Gorgeous transparent mahogany.  The head dissipates quickly.  Lovely nose of pit fruits, especially plums, with a mouth-watering sour note.  Thick and a bit sweet on the palate with a bit of a burnt sugar taste.  Nowhere near as acidic or tangy as the nose indicated, and a bit short.  This bottle-conditioned beer is probably a bit past its prime, but nowhere near the five and half years past its prime that its "Best Before" date of February 19, 1997 would indicate.  This beer has been in my wine cellar since purchase some 5+ years ago.","Realale","Beers"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark brown color with a slight red hue.  Tangy/fruity aromas in the nose.  Very little head that dissipated quickly and was heard to resurrect. Lighter bodied than other beers in the style.  Sweet and sour flavor leaning more towards the sweet.  Overall a good beer in the style, but not my favorite.","jreitman","0"
