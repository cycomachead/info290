Smell is full of cherry and oak, vinious and fruity, red berry, alcohol at points and some malt/wheat as well. Taste is of cherry but also fairly malty before getting to oak and tart fruits, drying sour berry with a bit of alcohol flavours on the back end. Medium drying carbonation, medium body. Quite good, but I feel this would benefit from a bit more time but would have it again gladly anytime.","peensteen","Nov 07, 2013"

It might be starting to thin out a bit, but this beer is still quite good. Lots of fruit - sour cherries and berries. Some vinegar and acid. Medium sour. Soft feel. A very good beer, though not quite up to the best of this wonderful style. Edit: 2010 version. Draft. Very good, again. Much more funky oak flavor than I remember from the last batch. Very woody dry. Sort of a cheesy flavor. Sour cherries are delicious and don’t overwhelm. Refined and complex. Full mouthfeel. The mouthfeel of Dissident is noticeably best from a fresh keg, in my opinion. Not too sour yet. Edit 2012: My opinion on Dissident has gone done somewhat. It seems a bit too sweet and the flavor is muddier than I remember. I'll revisit this review again at some point, but I'm lowering my scores for now.","popery","Jan 27, 2013"

Aromas of vinegar. Very sharp and sour fragrance. Amber orange in color with a tan head that doesn't sustain very long, but leaves nice lace on top. Can tell it's highly carbonated as it look and sounds explosive. Wow. This is a bomb to the palate. Heavy alcohol notes. Very tart and light sourness. The alcohol has an immediate warming effect. Fruity, sour apple and cherry flavors. Alot of red wine in the mix as well. I don't care for the aftertaste. It's very metallic and just off somehow. Too bad. Maybe not as carbonated as it looks at first but I think it lost alot of it sitting in the glass.

3.85,-8.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours caramel with a slight amber hue and a small khaki head. Smells lacto sour, brown sugar, cherries and apples, a slight hint of some vanilla and the wine barrels. Some alcohol in the finish. Amazing flavor and quite complex. Some sour lacto, tart cherries, apple, a little funky, the barrels, and some leather. I expected more alcohol to be noticeable than there actually was which was a nice surprise. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, a really nice beer even 11 months prior to its best after date, I can only imagine how good it will be then.","denver10","Nov 02, 2012"
4.01,-4.5,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours amber with a cherry hue, etched surface with a rim of light cream foam. The smell was evident from a couple feet upon pouring - really richly cherry this year. There are notes of lacto, breat and oak with plenty of the wine character coming through and lots of nice, tart cherries. The flavor is tart up front with a bit of heat and plenty of cherry flavor. This is really remarkable in that it is very, very fruit forward and most in the style that I've had are more oak balanced. I think I prefer this approach. The tartness is not quite sour per se, but is richly enhancing the overall tone of the beer. There is much, much less wood and grain perceived this year than 2010 when fresh. Medium on light syrup body with limited, soft and fine carb with a watering finish. Nice beer. I am really glad I got a good stash of this vintage.","harrymel","Oct 30, 2012"

Whispers of alcohol permeate from the snifter I am using. The faint foamy head dissipates quickly. My first drink into this beer tells me this moment is going to be quite awkward. My palate has cherry, oak, sweet caramel and a flush of acidity almost like a deep red wine such as a shiraz. It seems to be lacking of carbonation and has almost medicinal qualities.

Nose is tart cherries, pinot noir, woody, slight vanilla, French oak (you can actually smell the difference between French and American oak), black plums, dark fruit and some spice notes. Taste is cherries, grapes, green apples, oak, plums, red wine, booze and a bit of some kind of spice, maybe cinnamon or clove. Something with a kick. This was the first sour ale I ever tried (the 2010 vintage) and it blew my mind. Its just as good as I remember. I'm psyched about the two I have put away til after 8/30/13. Its a long wait but it'll be worth it. I can definitely taste the parts of this that were in that Collage I had last night. Deschutes rules.","DonDirkA","Oct 24, 2012"

4.17,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"just one of those classics for me. it looks a little thin, light brown color with a red hue to it. good carbonation is obvious, as a fizzy white head rises up. the nose is intense. lots of red wine vibes, although this isnt barrel aged in vino. also lots of sour in the aroma. brett and lacto at least, but this isnt acidic. there is some sweetness in the flavor from the malt, and that red fruit tone again. maybe something tart in fruit, like cranberries or something. more red wine tannins in the finish, and a puckery sour. the alcohol is well hidden, a superbly dirnkable bottle. medium body in the end, and bold carbonation just short of pop like. its expensive and rare, but it is just a beer that you need to seek out. its hard to describe because it stands alone. a sour yes, but its so much more than that. one of the more complex bottles of beer around.","StonedTrippin","Oct 15, 2012"

Light, light funk with some faint lactic sour hints. No acetic acid. Little bit of sweet and sour candy, and a hint of oak. A fantastic smelling ale. Big sour cherry flavor hits you over the head, kinda of a rough biting sourness. Faintly reminding me of cough syrup on the finish. Very low in the funk department. Really no vinegary sourness to speak of it is more of a lactic / natural fruity sourness. A bit of a bitter quality that is off putting. But show cases a nice oud bruin charecter. Surprisingly not thin on the mouthfeel, but it is dry and vinous which is nice. Altogether while this is not my favorite take on the style it is a good interpretation. I get it, I just don't know if I'm a huge fan. I repeat though I feel Deschutes carried through on this well.","pmlondrigan","Apr 08, 2012"

The brett is strong in this one. It goes in between fruit and yeasty dryness. I don't think I've had this style this big and this dry before. It's an interesting drink.

4.2,0,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Deschutes The Dissident pours an opaque mahogany, and proper backlighting lightens the edges to more of a red-orange. The two pours churned up one and two fingers of very light tan foam serving as a head. Retention is minimal and lacing nonexistent, but I guess that's somewhat to be expected.The nose is heavy on cherry and dark fruits from the wine barrel aging. There's a bit of funk and a bit of tartness, but the aforementioned cherry/fruit really form the center of the aroma. The flavor allows the supporting notes to shine through a bit more. An acidity/tartness leads off and immediately grabs my tastebuds' attention. The cherry and red wine that so dominated the nose slide in and occupy things mid palate. The brett flavors finish the beer off, and it's nicely nuanced. Notes of leather and tobacco are a great way to close the beer. The mouthfeel is solid, yet unspectacular. It's not as dry as I would have expected, but still fairly well attenuated. The carbonation's not as expansive as is usually found in some other Belgian styles, but it's still active enough to let you know its there. 3 years later and this vintage of The Dissident is drinking very nicely. Another great offering from the brewery that's brought me The Abyss and Mirror Mirror.","axeman9182","Oct 26, 2011"

Poured bright red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet amlt, sour, funk, tart, and dark fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were quite good despite the fact that neither was very complex. With that, it must be known that I am a big sour head, so this was right up my alley. I think this one could have benefited from a small amount of acetic acid in the flavor and aroma, but that is about it.

Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a medium off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is just how I like my Flanders-style beers. Nice tart cherry aromas with oak and vanilla. There are also some lovely Brett aromas. Smells like Supplication...lets see if it tastes as good as the RR classic... interesting... quite different. There are definitely aspects that are much like Supplication. The cherry and oak flavors are spot-on. TONS of oak, which I love. This beer is sweeter than I was expecting though. It is much sweeter than Supplication... quite a bit boozier too. That can be expected at being over 10%ABV though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a dry, tart finish. Drinkability is high, as long as the booze doesn't become overwhelming. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this one, and I would definitely purchase it again.

It lacks the nuance I've experienced with RR's sours that make use of all three strands of sour yeasts- a bit of lactic acid would tame the tartness add a creamy mouthfeel. Still, I'm eager to try this again in a year or two.","Ghenna","Jan 23, 2011"

4.42,5.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"The Dissident is simply spectacular. Balanced but assertive, the alcohol heat is remarkably well-hidden behind a wall of flavors. The sour, wild nature is readily apparent, but the massive flavors from the malt and cherries, rounded out by barrel aging, come together so nicely. This is presumably from the brand-new, November 2010 release, so this keg was less than a month old and snappier than hell. If you find a bottle, buy it; if you see it on draft, order two. Silly-drinkable for this style, and silky smooth all around.","BretSikkink","Dec 12, 2010"

There's a lightly fruity tart bite like you'd expect from a wild ale, and really this reminds me of an American wild ale like the Odell's Woodcut Series. You can taste a little of the cherries and they're matched with a lemon peel bite. The sour character is relatively clean considering how earthy and funky some Belgian get. Still, it's a tasty beer and I'd expect it to develop nicely over time. Even at 9%, it's relatively drinkable for the strength and I wouldn't have minded a few more glasses.","tempest","Dec 12, 2010"

The second pour was into a snifter and did have a slight tan head. Aroma is that of sour cherries and slight acidic notes, very minimal aroma with some sweetness. Medium/light mouthfeel with slight carbonation. Slightly boozy. Cherry taste with white wine characteristics. Woody. The Brett is pretty subdued, may be interesting how time treats this.

Softly tart with oaky wine barrel, sour cherries, and a bit of brett funkiness on the palate. Similar in taste to the Deschutes St Ryan's - which had some extra brett flavors. Fruits come out as it warms up.. Can't say that it is as tart as the previous version or as sour to me. So, while muted, still a very nice cherry flavored finish. Well done and refreshing.

Tart on the nose, but also prominently acetic as well, nice interplay between the two "sour" notes. A bit of cherries, some oak. Flavors work together really nicely, some vinegar, tart cherries, apples, light brown malts. They all come together well while still showcasing their individual lights. Dry finish, medium to full body for a sour. Overall a great drink, crisp, refreshing, sad to see it go.","LordAdmNelson","Dec 01, 2010"

The nose and the palate are loaded with red and dark fruit flavors with some slight spice malts that blance out the fruity flavors.

4.03,-4,4.5,4,4,4,4," Body is a pretty reddish amber color, toped by a small, creamy, off-white head. Aroma is mostly tart cherries, with some lactic acid, astringency, and sour notes. Palate is deliciously complex - balanced between the sweetness of the fruit and light, airy malt and just a hint of sourness up front. The lactic sourness builds before the swallow, then takes over completely on the finish. Lively carbonation keeps the cherries dancing around the acidity. This has aged very well.

Aroma of wine-like characters and almost lambic in nature. Really thick palate that filled and expanded nicely in the mouth. This brown style had a little more bitterness and darker malt notes than its Red counterpart, and it seemed the wild yeast really did a nice job.

I was quite surprised to find it as I haven't seen it in my native Oregon since it was released! The colour was a ruby-amber with no head.

Sour cherry and cranberry fruitiness is well done and does not go overboard. I could see this one would not age well over extended periods of time as the vinegar aspect of the beer would start to overwhelm. From the taste of it, seems 2 years is just about right. There is even a touch of hop presence, giving it a little North American feel. The rotting wood character that was prevalent in the nose is more in the background on the palate. The ABV is ridiculously well hidden, cant even taste it. I could easily drink a whole bomber to myself and still might crave some more. Excellent beer, I really dig it. Goes well with Craisins and soft chevre goat cheese.","twiggamortis420","Jan 23, 2010"

4.47,6.4,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"What a treat to find a Flanders Brown Ale! I was shocked when I heard about it and of course rushed to our local beer shop and picked it up. The aroma was full of complex dark fruits and malt character with sour notes. When pouring, the aromas waft up out of the billows of frothy off-white head. The color is a pleasant medium brown with a few garnet highlights. Brilliant clarity and the head persists while drinking -slight lacing. I was impressed with the balance of flavors in this beer. It begins with toasty malt character and deep fruitiness thatlayers into the sour semi-dry finish. The hops are really not noticeable but there may be a touch of bitterness to counter point the sour and fruit character. The sourness of the beer is prominent but balanced with the other components of the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slight drying, and the sourness has that to-style touch of astringency. Overall, the beer is very well-balanced and drinkable once your palate adjusts for the sourness. A beer well worth the purchase particularly for such a hard-to-find style.","coastie04","Jun 19, 2009"

Keeps with that yeasty feel as you take first sip followed by an initial sweet tart tingle on the tongue. The tart feel turns slightly vinegary but still nice.

A bit sharp on the nose, mildly acetic but quite tart overall. Slightly earthy with some cinnamon spiciness and light horsey funk. The flavour was full of tart fruit and berry, some earthy brett and dried fruit towards the end. Oak and vanilla, plus a bit of molasses appeared as it warmed. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation. The bubbles were quite light on the palate though, giving it a smooth texture. Nicely balanced, quite a mellow sour (at least after the other monsters we imbibed).","DrJay","Dec 07, 2008"

Taste is very fruity, oak, brown sugar and vanilla, honey, sour fruit, cinnamon and a neat spiciness, sour fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation.

Aroma is malty, with funky cherries and earthy wood. Not like other sours. Smooth and warm cherry, malt, oak, and vanilla. When the sour comes, it is mellow.

Starts off tart and fizzy, with bouncy apple and sour cherry flavors. Needs to warm up significantly from refrigerator temps to show all its complexity. As it warms, the tight sour notes open up to more vinous dark fruit and wood. Some toasty oak/vanilla notes, almost like a rich California chard, come through in the nose, and again in the finish, at warmer temps. By the end it is supple and soft, with some black fruit and red grape skin flavors, but it becomes a little watery. It has some fleeting moments where it could pass for an Oregon pinot noir from a very rainy year. Interesting beer, but seems to come out of the gate too fast and then fades at the finish. Nonetheless, a treat from one of my favorite breweries.","bcm119","Nov 17, 2008"

The taste exhibits some funk and tannins along with the sour tang and creaminess. Some slight spiciness throughout the taste.

Subtle malty notes hiding in the back to bring you down. It leaves a lemonade sweet flavor on my lips after each sip. This is one of the first sours I've really enjoyed.

Being such a big fan of flanders style ales, I was expecting a much more sour/tart taste with a fruity finish. I got the finish and most of the heavy fruit pickups but I just didn't get that tartness that I was craving. Still...much respect for this wild ale and for the dedication it took to brew this.

A moist grassy aroma and strawberry/rhubarb sprinkled with brown sugar in the nose as well. Taste starts off with Sweedish Fish and crab apples followed by caramel and oak. Midway some vinegar and weak brett battle each other on the tongue. The bland aftertaste is a bit of a disappointment, artificial candy cherry flavors and hay.

Oak is much milder in the flavor than the aroma. Bit of a tart circusy finish that leaves the tongue clingy dry and almost makes the teeth sticky dry. Actually, a bit merlot wine-like. Medium body likely helps this beer, as a light body wouldn't be able to hold flvaors on the tongue and a heavier beer would be sticky.

Taste is subtle, fruity but with a hint of chocolate malt. Not as tart as the odor suggests, but still a touch. Alcohol present but not overwhelming. A nice mouthfeel, approaching full-bodied, at least in so far as the style allows. A syrupy quality, though not too thick. A well-crafted foray into wild ales for Deschutes.

More fruit emerges when it warms as the funk slightly subsides. there's some good body to this one with all the funk clinging to the sides of my mouth, but the sour fruit keeps me constantly sipping. this is by far the most complex flemish red ive had so far, and with all the Brett funk, my favorite at this point.","vasdef42","Oct 01, 2008"

4.47,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: This is kind of similar to a Lambic in that it uses wild yeast, but the degree of sourness is VERY mild compared to beers such as Rodenbach and Cantillon. This is a very easy drinking tart beer that sweetens quickly and flows across the palate leaving you completely satisfied. All I can say is I'm glad I bought 6 bottles of this the day it was released. $60 well spent!","julian","Sep 24, 2008"
2.08,-50.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,"Rusted brick colored brew with a well lasting white head. Really poor nose. Main complaint is the poor concentration and vibrancy and the aromatic elements that are present are mostly unpleasant, brash and unauthentic. Notes of sweet cherries, vanilla and oak are present in the nose, but mostly covered by the unpleasant aromas. Flavor is initially sweet in the front and mid-palate and then fades into a sour harshness towards the finish. Really poorly balanced and brash. Unauthentic and very hard to drink. Some serious problems with this beer: Sterile filtered and force carbonated, aging a portion in wood for only 3 months (not long enough and age the whole beer.) But the bottom line is the flavor and aroma suck. Blah.","Crosling","Sep 24, 2008"

I will probably pick up another for long term storage.","erikm25","Sep 20, 2008"

4.2,0,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: For a sour beer, pretty drinkable. BA claims Dissident is 11% ABV. The bottle says 9%. 9 sounds more accurate, based on the drinkability. Regardless, at a minimum, this should be sold in a smaller bottle in addition to the bomber.","waltonc","Sep 16, 2008"

4.55,8.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Pours a beautiful deep amber color, with a thin white head that settles fairly quickly, leaving some light lacing. Aroma is an amazing cider vinegar sour, with a hint of a cinnamon. Sour beers can be hit or miss. This one hits it out of the park. I love the sour cider flavor, but the fact that it has some depth to it is what does it for me. Mouthfeel is very crisp, maybe a little thin. Very drinkable, as far as sour beers go. DEFINITELY worth a try.","BigJTrucker","Sep 13, 2008"
4.37,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Bought from Roths Vista Market,Salem,OR Bright brown beer with a tan head, thats pretty small and bubbly,leaves goodly lace. Marvelous aroma to this one: malty,spicy, fruity( green apple and sour plooms),sour..like fresh lemon juice or good vinegar.Lovelly stuff. Tartness,semi-sweet malts compete..with a building yet gracious sourness building to coat the tongue, soor plooms aagain , and a bite of cooking apple/crab apple.Slight "barnyard" and oaky residue . Lovelly and lively on the tongue..great long lasting sourness. Overall a very nice beer. I m far from being even competent in this style..but this was most enjoyable.","Reidrover","Sep 13, 2008"
4.22,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall, I like it. It is not the most amazing oud bruin in the world, and the bottles (to be reviewed later) are quite spendy. What is most exciting about this oud bruin to me, is that it is a very fine representation of the style, (despite the high abv) and it is brewed in america. I am glad we are starting to see some breweries getting some good flemish style ales on the market. It shows much promise for the future of american brewing, as far as the somewhat more obscure belgian styles. A good beer, and a solid representation of the style (aside from the beefed up abv!) haha.","AKBelgianBeast","Sep 12, 2008"
