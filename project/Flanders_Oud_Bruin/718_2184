I do not have any previous experience with this specific style of beer, nor would I consider myself a big fan of sours in general - but Petrus Aged Pale is quite possibly my favourite sour so far. The funky acidity and the tannins from the barrel result in an eminently quaffable, unique little brew that has gone a long way towards changing my opinion of sours. A good 'gateway sour', due to the affordable price point and approachable flavour profile - I will definitely make sure to procure a few more bottles of this for the cellar, since I don't expect this to remain available in Ontario indefinitely.","thehyperduck","Mar 05, 2015"

Also, I would like more of a pale ale aspect to this beer.  If you want a sour pale ale, get Jolly Pumpkin's Luciernaga instead of this. If you don't care about the pale ale aspect, this beer will be cheaper than Luciernaga. Also, after looking it up, this beer is classified by BA as a Flanders Oud Bruin, whereas Luciernaga is a Belgian Pale. I guess that explains the differences.","mchegash","Feb 21, 2015"

The aroma offered a hint of the sour to come with some citrussy character from a hoppy beer. But the taste was just a wonderful level tartness that was like nothing I had encountered. This is the beer that set me off on a long run of sours. It is therefore my benchmark since it was my first sour. I may revise once I have had more from this style, but this will be a repeat purchase.","MisterGone","Aug 28, 2014"

Although this was a very good Oud Bruin, it paled in comparison the the Monk's version. Very session able and may have received a higher rating if I had it on a different session but much weaker in taste and higher in alcohol. Basically the light version of the Monk's Flemish with higher ABV. Personally, I rate based on flavor, not for speed of inebriation.","wattoclone","Jul 31, 2014"

Far sooner than the palate would prefer, the taste evaporates in a whimsical cloud that overs above the tongue. Much of its wonderment is better appreciated in a wheaty, vinous aftertaste, full of oak tanning than it is in actual time.","BEERchitect","Jul 13, 2014"

This sour is a golden orange amber hue with ample beige foam; features larger bubbles than the Flanders reds from Rodenbach I have sampled. Smells very carbolic, like white wine vinegar, along with zesty lemon juice and a tannic woodiness. Taste is a fascinating blend of aggressive sour and caramel sweetness ... There's a gentle sweet backbone of vanilla nougat, dairy-based confectionery, carob, and raisins with a hint of dried banana chip, with all this lurking beneath another tart factor that recalls sour gummy candies, unripe cherry, pomegranate molasses, green apple, tangerine peel, and grainy vinegar. To my palate the sourness is about on par with Rodenbach Grand Cru, maybe even a hair more, with a thin body and rather prickly carbonation. Finishes dry, acidic, and woody. A tasty introduction to the style and to sours more generally.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 22, 2014"

Lemon, tart cherries and stinky fermented red cherries, white wine, tea, raspberries, green grapes, and a clean light malt sweetness. Taste is tart throughout. Puckering to an extent but not more tart than other sour beers. Very light sweetness underneath flavors of musky berries, white wine, and green grape skins. Very dry, almost chalky mouthfeel. It makes your mouth water. Drinkability is solid. Goes down easy but you're compelled to space sips out because of the entertaining tartness.","tastybeer","Jan 24, 2014"

Sour citrus burns a hole through my mucus membranes; not particularly what I'd expect from an oud bruin. Deep whiffs draw out barrel-tinged malts and grapefruit. On the tongue it's sharp, sour and acidic with a wonderful finish. A fine brew for heartburn enthusiasts. Sour grapefruit, juicy apples, lemon peel and a hint of cherry. It's heavily carbonated and goes down easy, though "smooth" is the last adjective I'd attach to this one. I think this beverage is doing serious damage to my stomach lining. Otherwise, sure, it's a good sour. Nothing out of this world, but a very drinkable brew.","xabyss","Dec 31, 2013"

The aroma was an excellent bouquet of floral and fruit scents, with a slight suggestion of funky yeast as well. The taste revealed the benefits of aging with a pleasant earthiness, and a tasty cider sourness. Very tart and wine-like. Moderate body with a dry mouth feel. I would have loved to have a nice cheese plate with this... maybe next time. Order this when you can fully appreciate it's delicate beauty... this is one fine sour.","Neorebel","Oct 01, 2013"

It's interesting to see a Belgian pale turned upside down and becoming a refreshing and complex offering as a sour beer. The oak and yeast are the stars here, but that Belgian sweetness (which can get grating) is far different here, and resembling actual off-dry fruit rather than something more mundane. Recommended, but don't go out of your way to get the Sour Power pack just to get 2 bottles. At $4 a bottle elsewhere, however, this is a good bargain indeed.","magictacosinus","Sep 16, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with the even tarter lemon dominating all else in a pleasant WarHeads type of way. The body is a rather light medium, with a light carbonation and a slick feel.

Aromas are tart and sweet, robust and forward, with notes of apple, toasted grains, and subtle woody highlights. Mouth watering nose. Flavors are bold and tart, with an underlying roasted character, almost char-like. Toasty grain/bread notes noticeable initially, but they are quickly swallowed up by the sour characteristics, with a tangy sweetness that keeps the drinkability high. The aftertaste is more of the woody and char characteristics, but with a solid ribbon of tart still present. Clean, smooth finish with a slight puckering. Very drinkable throughout.

The taste comes on strong and kicks you in the tongue with sourness, but it's not unpleasant. As you drink more the sourness subsides and flavors of orange and tang are left. Is a beer that appeals to different areas of the tongue. It also displays flavors of oak due to the aging. So we have flavors of oak, orange, sour, green wood, and hops to bring it all together. And it's tame enough to drink non-stop. Fantastic","LordChesterfield","May 05, 2013"

A sour beer of this caliber is no easier to drink than a fine scotch; sipping is the best way to approach. The color is a dull without being hazy, the nose a tart lactic, acidic burn. The taste followed the nose with a sour, acidic bile flavor masking the taste of malts and hops. Hints of vanilla, "greenness" and wood are undetectable under the acid burn. Sweet caramel and grain show up in the aftertaste and comes on after the sour acid fades away. The mouthfeel is as thin as would be expected, with a carbonated bite that helps the flavor along. All in all, this is a beer that I highly appreciate, and have no desire to drink again.","Aaron_Ramson","Mar 29, 2013"

On top of the beer sits a big white head, almost three fingers, soapy and thick, with good retention.Aroma is of grapes, sweet-sour, some citrus notes in it. Very high acidity on the taste, this one screams sour! Again, lots of white grapes on the taste. After my initial big gulp, where I almost choke from the acidity, I started drinking it with slow small sips and it‚Äôs quite good. Full body and average carbonation. A combination of dryness and tartness on the palate. Still not very experienced on this style, but I liked this one. Reminded me of a homemade wine an uncle of mine was making, so maybe it‚Äôs also the memories, but this beer was quite enjoyable and I guess it would be even better with a meal.","Douberd","Feb 19, 2013"

It is not so sour as to render it undrinkable or to shock the taster, but it is sour enough to recall what is so appealing about sourness in the first place. As the beer warms, the oak comes out a lot more and adds some much needed complexity that I noted as lacking. I would not say I am hooked on sours yet, but this definitely intrigued me further. A word of warning (probably regarding all sours): though the ABV is relatively low and the drinkability is high, this is probably still a sipper, as the sour flavors can be overpowering both to the palate and the stomach if ingested too quickly. 15.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Nov 19, 2012"

Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a crisp and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish.

Those of us looking for a great, expertly crafted sour will find plenty of to love here. Petrus Aged Pale pours out a golden color with a small head. The aroma is tart and vinous, with some oak and cherry rounding everything out. The taste is excellent. It's tart and sharp at first, with a great apple and cherry bite. It's very acidic for sure, but doesn't come off as being too far down that line. I'd like to credit that to the oak-aging, taking a bit of the bite off with just a small contribution to flavor.

The smell reached me immediately, well before lifting glass to nose: sawdust, as if from sandalwood or some other aromatic specimen, (and on further study) spice aromas, orange blossom, vegetal-chocolate notes, some toast. (It would be top score if only if it were a bit stronger.) Dryness and astringency rush in with the taste, giving much more feel before flavors emerge.

The nose had a tartness like sour cherries and my mouth puckered and my tongue began to water. I am not a fan of sour beers, but I can appreciate them and this seemed like it was going to be good. My first sip gave off a vinegar tartness initially, then kicked in with green apples, wood and finally sour cherries. Wow! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a good bit of effervescence present.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"One finger white head, pretty quick dissipation resulting in thin broken layer with ring around edge of glass, opening resulted in numerous streams of uprising carbonation that quickly subsided resulting in medium amber hazy body and several streams rising up near sides of glass. IMO a bit light colorwise for style, not sure this fits into Oud Bruin category, more of a gone to funk Belgian Pale. Funky nose, certainly indicative of the sourness to come.a bit of light horseblanket and some grassiness. Taste is sour forward balanced by some tartness on the backend, peach sweet tarts, floral hops on the back end. . Mouthfeel a bit on the light side, thinnish, decent effervescence, finsih is not too astringent. Interesting, wonder how this would stand up to some cellaring. Interesting, but certainly not for the sour mewbie, pretty aggressive sour-wise.","jdense","Feb 04, 2012"

4.29,5.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I was at The Trappist and my friend wanted to try Petrus, which I hadn't heard of before. When the bartender said that the Petrus Aged Pale was made for Michael Jackson, I stopped him in his tracks and asked him to retrieve a bottle for us. While he was pouring it for us he explained that Bavik approached MJ himself to ask what type of beer he would like them to make. When he asked for a Flanders Pale, Petrus was confused. How would one make such a thing? They put their heads together and made it happen. The back story surely changed my expectations of the beer, but despite this, I feel I can look past it and say with certainty that this is a great beer. The only flaw I feel worth mentioning is that the taste profile is a bit thin and fleeting. Still, this is a complex beer showing all the colors in the thin spectrum of flavors it illuminates. Not something you'd want any given day of the week, this is a special beer for a special occasion. Our occasion was a Saturday night. When you find your occasion, seek this beer out and enjoy.","Philousa","Jan 22, 2012"

The nose did not prepapre for the lock jaw sour from the beginning of the sip to well past the finish. I don't pick up any vanilla or even that much sweetness. This almost perfect the way it is. Its a very light gold in appearance with very minimal head, the clarity on this beer is amazing. The mouthfeel is full of vibrant acidity and carbonantion, it has a very dry finish and strong pucker. Overall this is a very well done beer and a very affordable price( $9 for 750ml). I can see this becoming a regular beer in my lineup.","kaips1","Jan 03, 2012"

Smell is tart, sour, and funky with a slight metallic aroma. Taste is of sour/tart fruit up front with a malt aftertaste. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly acidic mouthfeel. Very bubbly but it works with the flavors.

The aroma is of tart fruits, specifically apple, lending a cider-like scent. A bit of funky yeast is mixed in with light grains (straw, hay, some wheat), and it finishes with a vague hint of wood. It tastes of tart apple, some pear, the muddled grains, some lemon citrus, and a dry oaken finish. The barrel makes is presence known towards the end.

Is fleetingly think of a good lambic. The ABV is not readily detectable. Excellent to quench his thirst and to get unique flavors.

The smell is fairly tart, but with a sweet, pale fruit component to it as well. The flavor adds more layers to that base, giving the beer more of a refined edge. A sharp tartness is definitely what jumps out right from the first sip. Once my palate was acclimated to the acidity though, the rest of the beer began to really shine through. Green apple skin and peaches provide a sweetness that helps counteract the beer's dominant sour characteristic. The back end of each sip highlights a delicate oak/cherry pit note that really elevates the beer. The body is appropriately light for a relatively small sour beer, and the carbonation serves its purpose of preventing the beer from turning into a syrup, and nothing more. I haven't had Petrus Oude Bruin, but if the final beer is as good as this thread that goes into it is, I'll be in for a hell of a brew.","axeman9182","Jun 23, 2011"

The flavor of this brew has a tartness upfront with fruity hints and vinegar character. Quite a bit of puckering power with it's sourness level. Light bodied with a modest level of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. Lingering flavor of funk and an oaky woodsiness left in the mouth that exaggerates the dryness of this beer along with an ever increasing amount of alcohol.

Scent is of tart and acidic wine grapes backed by hints of apple, soapy lemon, musty straw and vinegar. Taste is a little smoother than the muddled and bold scent dictates but brings the qualitites of tart and acidic wine grapes and musty hay to the front, apple and vinegar in the middle and finishes with the soapy lemon. Very little oak charachter. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly below average level of carbonation, tingly and prickly on the palate though, slight lingering tartness.

Great funky, tart, sour fruit aroma. First sip hits you with that same sour funk, and then mellows out quite a bit. I got a lot of sour apple/grapes mixed in with a musty funk and acidity. There is a slight sweetness to balance it all through the beer and a very pleasant dryness at the end. There is a medium to light body which is a bit thin for an Oud Bruin, however this one is a "Pale" ale. . . either way I would have preferred more body.

There is also a sugary aroma that pops through. Clearly oaked aged. A big lemony tart/sour flavor. Perhaps too lemony as you don't really pick up any actual oak flavors. There is a seltzer water type flavor as well. I guess what is disappointing is that the rest of the beer doesn't show up. I would like to see hints of malt and yeast but all I really pick up is the sour. There is a very very very light cider like flavor. There is a bitter aspect towards the finish, kind of woody. The feel is light, fizzy and puckering which is what I would expect from a sour. Again some bitterness in the finish. I'm not an expert on this style so not too much to base this beer on.

Overall this seemed more like champagne than beer, but it had an interesting and decent flavor. The sour and bubbly character made this a definite sipping beer, but the alcohol was pretty well hidden. I don't have a lot of experience with sour beers, so this was challenging for me to drink.

Medium-bodied, here too retains a military erectness and compactness, this in spite of a strong prickly carbonation to it. The inherent acidity to it heightens the sourness of the lemon, orange citrus, touches on white grapefruit. There's a raw yeasty quality next to the rustic rye bread element. Apple, apricot, peach, cherry fruit more present here, but not by much. The oak comes across as sour too, like dill herb. Keeps you mouth clenching, close to full-on pucker.

In this case it's a good thing. I can taste sour apple, vinegar, sour cherries, and a bit of oak and funk. The sourness does die down a little bit after the beer warms up some. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's crisp, dry and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good too, if you like sour style beers, then you would enjoy this one.

I hate to compare beer to a candy, but there was a sweet and funky sour taste to it. I really didnt notice any "wood" or "oak" taste intially, but there was a distinct flavor on the back of the tounge that had that feeling to it.

The palate is really very tart up front and hardly yields to a nice woody character. This ale is very tart and leaves the mouth watering. Mouth feel is on the light side, but very crisp and clean like sucking on a sour apple. The woody, earthy mustiness comes through too, lingering in the mouth. Tart and sharply acidic. Oddly, my bottle reads that this ale is only 5.8% alcohol by volume, although it's listed at 7.3% here. I tend to believe my bottle, and my palate, on this one - unless the alcohol is just that well hidden. A true treat and a great example of the oud bruin style, albeit a bit lighter in color.

The body is light with medium carbonation and a tannin-like dryness in its medium finish. The beer isn't as tart as the first sip indicated - it's actually pretty mild compared to the Rene Cuvee I had the other day - but there isn't too much going on besides the sour flavors.

Tastes like honey at first and then gets gripping sour and dry notes in the finish. Oak aging is present throughout. Healthy carbonation keeps it crisp on the palate. This is a very nice beer for many reasons. It drinks like a Flemish red or brown except it has pale characteristics.

The nose is vibrantly acidic, awesome! Sharp lemony notes dominant, hints of wood at the back. There is some distant spice and alcohol. Peppery. Minty. Light yeasty funk. Everything aside from the acidity is light to faint in potency. While I can¬ít call the nose complex, I can¬ít call it simplistic either. It is very inviting with enough layers to damn near force me to drink. Well, the nose didn¬ít lie. The palate is very acidic. My first sip shocked me a bit. I got over it, needless to say. Lemony flavors developed, dry in the middle, woody too with faint hints of pepper and mint. Right before the finish there is a juicy burst but the finish is dry and quick to end. Overall the palate is lackluster as there isn¬ít much going on. Sure I like what I taste but I want more of it and more complementary flavors as well. I must complement the fact that I can¬ít taste the alcohol. The very light carbonation is noticeable and more is needed. Medium in body but it feels a bit too light. Empty. Also the aftertaste is too clean, did I just sip a Belgium ale? My mouth says no. Overall, this beer doesn¬ít impress me at all. I don¬ít think I¬íll bother with this one again as there are many better beers akin to this one. For some unknown reason I put off sampling this beer since February. I bought my bottle in Iowa City.

This can't be clearer, I see my finger prints through it, but the head my friends is the perfect white, sticky as if it weren't enough. The body is pure liquid gold, very shining, spectacular one may say. Very effervescent from the outside look. Aroma of wet hay, apple cider, grass (saison anyone?), a bit of funk, a definite sour touch, dry, not unlike a good champaign, grassy. Isn't this well structured and beautiful? In mouth, this is also reminiscent of champaign, very white wine alike in the dryness. Lightly bitter finish which adds a new complexity. Moderately malty with peaches and pears flavors. It's mostly about the delicate dryness though, puckering and hayish. Mouthfeel is quite biting, thin-medium and a nice fit. I feel I don't have the words to do it justice though, there'd be a lot more to say, but it's hard to be put in words. Very complex for sure and rather tart with gueuze character. Lovely dry aftertaste. I think this would be hard to drink in any kind of large quantities though, just like champaign once again. Truly in a class of its own and worth seeking out.","Rastacouere","Apr 04, 2004"

The beer was poured into a chalice style glass, with a fizzy head rising and quickly falling to become a ring and scattered spots of foam, leaving fine persistent lacing. The murky glowing pale peach liquid was alive with fizzy vigor, like a magical potion. The aged pale was also alive in the nose, spewing out potent clouds of tart fruit candy powder, late harvest grapes, and acidic, oaky pinot noir. The taste was crisp and dry, with a moderately acidic peachy tartness held up by an excellent body...full, smooth, and perfectly carbonated. It finished with a quickly diminishing dry acidity, leaving only faint traces of tart essence on the palate. Good, but a little short on the finish.

4.07,-0.2,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Turbid dark golden hue. Lean, but steadfast white head yields sparse lace. Pungent, barbed waft of acetic acid hits the nose upfront. Fruit, of a woefully underripe green apple nature, ensues along with understated notes of soured, tannic oak. Quite enticing aromawise. Cuspate lactic tartness is incipient in flavor, but is softened promptly by suggestions of crab apple and sourdough. Rounded enteric horse and hay notes emerge mid palate, but are subdued enough not to perturb the simple tart apple character. Very well attenuated, with an initially prickly, lanky mouthfeel softened by suspended yeast. Imperceptible dextrins or residual protein. Notes of oak augment as the brew warms and add depth to the pervasive tartness. Finishes bone dry and abrupt, with a snap of sour currant and ethanol warmth. An intense, yet balanced brew. Very much like an aged Gueuze in its mixed acid character, although obviously richer in ethanol. Very tasty, and most worthy of a larger, 750 ml portion. 11.2 oz is insufficient.","marc77","Nov 09, 2003"
