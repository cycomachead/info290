3.2,-8.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Half finger tan head, medium dissipation, good lacking. Medium brown body, clear, no visible carbonation. Quintescential Flanders Red nose, more tart than sweet. Taste is a bit too sweet, apparently this was sweetened with fruit juice, bummer, would have enjoyed more if they just left it tart with minimal sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, little effervescence, pretty dry finish. Not that impressive IMO, the sweetness was pretty cloying.","jdense","Mar 11, 2012"

3.63,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours an amber color, with a thin cocoa head. Little carbonation or lacing. Somewhat transparent in appearance. Nose is mainly vinegar, fruit, funk. Vinegar is the main thing I get, and the overall nose is on the weak side. Taste is funk, dark fruit, grapes, and oak. Same thing- everything is just a little weak and subdued. It definitely could use more funk! Feel is very light and refreshing. Overall, this beer is good, but kind of misses the mark for me. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Aug 17, 2011"
3.75,6.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear red pour with a nicely sized white head. The lacing is ok. Not nearly as acidic of a smell as I was expecting. Abut of vinegar and some dark fruits mostly like cherries. Sort of tastes unlike other Flanders Reds I've had. The cherries and funk are present, but don't take over the flavor. It's very light overall with a funk taste finishing it off. Light and seemingly under carbonated. Weird aftertaste This was a bit strange, not what I was expecting.","russwbeck","Feb 20, 2011"
3.7,5.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"o: I think this would be a great beer to pair with a nice slab of beef. The flavors are very complex and not really what I'd expect from something that's ostensibly a sour, but it was so interesting that I had to keep trying more.","ChickenArise","Dec 12, 2010"

3.61,2.8,3,4.5,3,3.5,4,"Got this at the 2010 GBBF. Pours a dark reddish brown with minimal head but a decent lacing and a very smooth but thin mouthfeel. Very pronounced aromas of mainly cherry, fig, prune, and Christmas cake. Taste is similar but muted so that you get the cherry but it is more artificial and the cake is a but stale tasing. Very easy to drink and although I coul ddrink this all day there are many other I would rather try ad the flavor gets rather dull.","thepeter","Jun 17, 2010"
3.08,-12.3,4,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Unfortunately the beer is very sweet, which drowns out the tartness at first. A caramelized fruitiness reminds me of plums, oxidized apple and berry flavors). The beer has a medium body for the style, which is clearly the product of excess sugars. Flavors of sherry, a nutty note in the finish as well as a faint tartness struggle to be noticed underneath the oppressive sweetness. This is really way too sweet, it is almost saccharine like, and really isn't the way I prefer this type of beer.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
4,14,4,4,4,4,4,"After consulting the bartender, I chose this guy over the Duvel Green. Maybe next time. (Thanks, Shelly!) It pours a somewhat hazy deep dark brown with a bit more than a finger of dark ecru froth on top. The nose comprises figs, soap, raisins, bubblegum, clove, dark malts, and brown sugar. Sweeter than I pictured, but tasty nonetheless. The taste is pretty similar, with notes of brown sugar-cinnamon, molasses, subdued black cherries, dark malts, plums, red apple skin (exhibiting a subtle tartness), raisins, and prunes. The body is medium, with light carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. I'm glad I chose this brew, as it's a nicely different flavor profile than I'm used to, especially when compared with the seeming standard taste that I imagine Duvel Green has.","TMoney2591","0"
3.58,2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"d - I thought this was ok, but way to sweet for me. Didn't get much sourness or tart, just a lot of sweetness. Wouldn't look to try again.","mdfb79","Mar 02, 2010"
3.47,-1.1,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Its overall thin in body with a slight sour flavor. Its not that great. There is some sweetness in there as well. I've definitely had better Flanders.","drabmuh","Beers"
4.07,16,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D- Super quaffable, despite the off-style characteristics. It certainly could use a little more tartness, but it's very drinkable nonetheless.","jgasparine","0"
