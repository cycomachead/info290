2.95,12.6,3.5,3.5,3,2,2.5,"D - At first I was shocked and appalled at the super-sugary flavor, but then the more I sipped the more I started to enjoy this for what it is. This is a desert-like substance that is best enjoyed in very small sips and thoroughly iced down. The bottles that I bought are about 8oz and IMO that's just about enough. I actually ended up really enjoying this... stuff... whatever it is.","pmcadamis","Jun 01, 2009"

2.02,-22.9,4,2,2,3,1,"Im surprised to see this on this site. I like to recommend this soda to friends at Mexican restaurants and laugh at them when they turn green after the first sip. This is not a beer and doesnt seem to fit with the low abv beer category. I believe the (up to) .5% abv is just a side affect of the process in which this is made, not the intention. I bought my first bottle when I was 17 or so and wasnt carded as one would be if buying near beer. At any rate, this is a rather interesting beverage that I do not particularly care for but do respect for its uniqueness. I would describe the entire experience, from appearances, to aromas, to flavor as drinking watered down molasses. This is a hard one to down if youre not used to it so its a good thing that it comes in a teeny tiny bottle. Some caramel and a general damp barley quality enter into play too but molasses dominates the day. Strange, strange brew.","DaPeculierDane","Nov 19, 2004"

1.03,-60.7,1.5,1,1,1,1,"Tried this at lunch at a Cuban restaurant on a recent visit to South Florida. Had never heard of it, but saw it on the menu & decided to try it. Should have known better when the waitress brought out a glass of ice with it & poured it over the ice. Managed to drink about 3/4 of it (along with liberal sips of water). Strange slightly sweet taste that lasted the rest of the day. Absolutely horrid.","jreid53","0"
