Really nice fruity, hoppy nose with the Citra really standing out along with hints of grapefruit and grass. The taste is hoppy and citrusy as well with hints of peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, pine, orange peel, and just a touch of grass. Just enough caramel malt sweetness to keep it balanced. The mouthfeel is light and crisp and totally refreshing. Fizzy carbonation with a nice tangy, bitter hop finish. Overall, this totally hit the mark as a low ABV summer session beer. Flavorful and refreshing and extremely drinkable. Another great beer from To Øl!","beerdrifter","0"
