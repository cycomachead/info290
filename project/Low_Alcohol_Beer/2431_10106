3.3,12.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pretty easy drinking for the style, offering just enough body to keep things interesting and nothing to detract. Carbonation does empty pretty quickly however, lending almost tea like qualities to the bottom of the glass.","HalfFull","Aug 14, 2008"

2.51,-14.3,3,2,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This is the one area where the beer is fairly successful combining compotent carbonation without going fizzy and finishing somewhat thick in the mouth. This would be for the designated driver who really needs to feel like they're drinking with the crowd. Not very good but actually better than a number of mass-produced beers I've tried. Glad I've at least tried a non-alcoholic though.","malcontent","Feb 06, 2005"
3.07,4.8,3,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Quite nice. A little wort-y for me ideally, but pretty close to real beer in terms of aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel.","shererjt","Jan 19, 2005"

2.91,-0.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"The biggish, foamy head is active, but not too fast. Creamy-whitish. The beer is a clear gold, hinting at being deep. Lots of spots of lacing. The aroma is very sweet: sugary corn. Man, that's some sweet corn. It carries over to the dusty front. The middle shows some caramel, but there's a chemical distraction. Finish is fairly bitter, never losing the sweet corn. This is an ok NA. The bitterness at the end is pleasant. Second tier.","kbub6f","Aug 02, 2004"

2.75,-6.1,4.5,2,3,3,2.5,"A crystal-clear, deep-gold body is topped by a good-sized head of creamy bright-white foam that holds quite well and leaves splotchy lace about the glass. Standard-sized bubbles race towards the surface, obviously adding to its retention. A distinctly grainy malt greets you in the nose along with some skunky hops despite the brown glass bottle. The body is medium and its median level carbonation leaves it crisp on the tongue. The same rich, grainy malt appears in the flavor, although it tastes a bit cooked. It's worty, and similar to liquid extract malt. Some floral and spicy hops come through the malt, and it's backed by a bold bitterness. It finishes dry with just a thin layer of residual sticky malt. Served well chilled it passes as a fair substitue for a quality German pilsner. As it warms and the true flavor of the malt becomes more apparent, however, it loses some of its refreshing character and becomes a bit cloying.","NeroFiddled","0"
