This style of beer just doesn’t interest me and I don’t see myself ever drinking it again. I can see where if you have drinking problems you could turn to this but for me I’ll still with beer with alcohol.","marty21","Oct 28, 2006"
1.13,-52.1,1.5,1,1,1,1.5,"Sampled a while ago. Not even sure why I had it to begin with. Perhaps bored. Had to struggle to just get through one. Aroma is weak pond water, color is standard swill gold, and the flavor is weak, watery with some wheaty grain flavor but what is there isn't very good at all.","changeup45","Jun 02, 2006"
2.16,-8.5,3,2,2,3,2,"This was a notch below Pabst N/A but tasted most like it. It was golden, fizzy but the smell, that empty husky beer scent that most n/a beers have detracted lots. Mouth was average and so was appearence, washed and drank like a soda beer beverage. Taste turned south though, this was sour, tasted of cooked corn, and was very acidic with nothing to back it up. When the bar ran out of Kalibur from Guiness I switched to this and bleah. It's the same taste category as Pabst NA but did not appeal to me at all. I'm assuming this is priced higher for a 6 like O'douls so for the taste/price ratio, doesn't cut it.","Ricochet","Jun 28, 2005"

2.43,3,2.5,2,2.5,3,2.5,"This is too sweet for me really. This is the only NA that I've ever had, and while it's not exactly bad, it's not exactly good either. I suppose if you are hell bent not to drink water to re-hydrate while holding a drinking session then you could go with this. I would still prefer to go with water.","Noxious26","Mar 25, 2003"
2.7,14.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Some skunk in the nose shouldering out the sweet corn. The front is mostly corn, but also some dust. The middle is thin and a little sour. Some metal shows up in the finish, but it's mostly more corn and a little soap. Overall, not bad. Nothing really detracts from this NA, but nothing stands out, either. Probably one of the lighter NAs.","kbub6f","Beers"
3.03,28.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Crystal clear medium golden color with a half-inch head that retains very well. Carbonation is moderate, lace is quite good. Aroma consists of unfermented wort and a caramel corn-like sweetness, as typical for these NA beers, although not quite as sweet as some. Some hops are present in the aroma, although not enough. The label states "fully brewed", not sure what that means in this case. The brewery website indicated that a patented low temperature brewing process is used to produce Exel. Be that as it may, this beer seems rather sweet to have been through a fermentation cycle. Taste begins with zesty carbonation, followed by sweet corn adjunct flavors; finish is mildly dry with slight hops. The mouth feel is pleasant, seemingly less watery than most NAs. Not bad, really, but more hops are needed to balance out the excessively sweet malt.","Pegasus","0"
