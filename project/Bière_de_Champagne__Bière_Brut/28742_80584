Complex and well crafted, and drinkable at 11%. Only other one of this style I've had is Infinium by Sam Adams. SA is absolute sewage compared to this, and actually is more expensive than this. Seek this, trade for this, try this.","OtherShoe2","Dec 07, 2013"

4.28,4.9,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O: This is one hell of a biere de champagne. If you've never had one, they are definitely very saison-ish but with champagne yeast characteristics instead of belgian yeast characteristics (very little in the way of earthiness, black pepper, etc). I hope I described that correct, just giving my impression. Amazing job of hiding the alcohol in this one, this has to be the easiest drinking 11% beer I've ever had. Flavors are well rounded, body isn't overly heavy and there is zero alcohol sting. Seriously good, easily the best of the style that I've ever had.","Dope","Jan 26, 2013"
