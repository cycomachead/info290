4.28,10.3,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Bottle: Poured a light dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some good lacing. Aroma of pongy rustic malt with light tart undertones is quite sublime. Taste is also a great mix of rustic malt with dry Brett notes with light funky yeast and some pungent notes also noticeable. Body is quite full with super great carbonation. A perfect mix of complexity and drinkability which appears to be a common thread form this brewery.","Phyl21ca","Jan 06, 2014"

4.03,3.9,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,4,"If you like the sound of Belgian-style Pale Ale and dry Prosecco then Panil Enhanced (Final) is the beer for you (and, to be sure, it's one of the only such beers in existence). Me, personally, I liked it a lot - it's nearly worth the stains it left on my kitchen wall. Considering it costs only as much as the cheapest sparkling wine - and is far more special - consider this a 'must buy'.","biegaman","Dec 24, 2013"
3.9,0.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"O - A great twist on the traditional Belgian pale, offering up a nice tart flavour that pairs nicely, but the volcano aspect was rather disappointing. I'm wondering if the bottle would've been ok had I let it warm a bit since I've known some beers whose heavy carbonation settled as it warmed up. In any case, a worthy brew and thoroughly enjoyed what was left of the bottle.","andrenaline","Dec 07, 2013"

3.9,0.5,4.25,3.5,4,4,4,"O: Overall I quite like it. Not a typical style but a nice use of wine yeast, though almost falls too much into being like a wine, even if I would assume there is no grapes in it.","4ster","0"
