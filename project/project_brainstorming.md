# Project Brainstorming
## Beer Prediction App

- Scrape [beeradvocate.com](http://beeradvocate.com)
- Play around with idea of predicting styles/ratings based on review text
- Create app that allows a user to input or scan a beer and gives them smart-sounding comments to make about it
  - Initially, we can just look up reviews of the exact beer they put in
  - Should probably differentiate between liking and disliking the beer - user can input whether they liked it
    and get positive comments back, etc. This would be an interesting NLP type problem, and could use some ML stuff.
  - Later, the user can give a style of beer and get generic comments, or get comments from similar beers (for the 
    purposes of variety)
- Name idea: "Snobbr"
