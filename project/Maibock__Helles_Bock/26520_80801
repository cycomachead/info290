Overall a very good and traditional take- practically flawless with excellent drinkability. I really enjoy this interpretation of the style: wonderful.","Slatetank","Jun 30, 2014"

Aromas of fruit sweetness, roasted notes, and wine-like characteristics. The sweetness does have a grape quality to it. Flavors of toasted grains on the forward tongue, with floral highlights and a subtle fruit sweetness. Tangy sweetness slowly builds as you drink. Smooth, mid-bodied brew that is pretty easy to drink. The aftertaste is roasted, and starts to develop a grassy, floral hops character. Smooth, clean finish. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Aug 24, 2013"

Aromas of sweet bready malty with hint of spice and fruit with a light spicy earthy hop aroma to round it all out. The flavor holds a creamy bready malty taste with lots of spicy earthy hops to balance it out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel.

Dry, sweet barleycorn mixed with weedy yellow hops and all kinds of weird verdant nodes so--to exhaust a descriptor I've been using dumbly for almost a decade--it tastes like a walk through a field at sunset. It's not quite as out-there pollen-y as New Glarus' dead, gorgeous Zwickle, but it's easily one of the very best American-made examples of its style that I've ever had.","mynie","Jun 10, 2013"

3.65,-5.7,4.25,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"500ml bottle served in a pilsener glass. Pours a translucent gold with a 2.5 inch, rocky, bright white head that collapses into a solid 1/8th inch cap. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution. Nose expresses grains and a hint of grapes. Taste reveals light malts, some fruity esters, sour mash, a strong noble hops presence and a light, lingering skunky quality at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a slight oiliness and an even carbonation that falls just short of lively. Overall, not my favorite offering from these guys - hops are too forward and fruit is too much in the background, in my opinion, for the style.","Jwale73","May 18, 2013"

3.23,-16.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Fads in beer brewing are easy to spot: three years ago everyone began selling overloaded, over-hyped, over-hopped beer; two years ago everyone was screaming about beer in cans; last year began the sticky march of fruity beer; this year it appears that lagers are the target. I like a really good lager, especially a nice clean maibock, but I'm not sure this one qualifies as "really good." It's decent but it seems like it's trying to be an ale: the body, aroma and taste are all very dense; it's rather flatly carbonated and has a yeasty, bready, doughy grip that just doesn't have much of a lager lean to it. Thinning it out a bit and jettisoning some of that yeasty freight would make it much more attractive.","gfreed","May 29, 2012"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Flavor? It had some crackery, bready, malt sweetness leading off, like a good Maibock should. Following that was some light fruitiness, suggesting pear and/or green apple. Bringing up the rear was noble hop florality. All in all, a solid rendition of the style. Prosit!!","Bierman9","May 21, 2012"

I'd say it's like their Jabby Brau, but it's not, it's so much closer to the traditional pure German Maibock/Helles style. If I didn't know better I'd say I was sitting in Germany drinking a fresh brau in a liter stine or something. Just a solid, solid, Maibock.","taez555","Apr 27, 2012"
