3.58,-5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, raisin, plum, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid maibock style. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Definitely showed some signs of age, but it held up well enough and was enjoyable.","superspak","Sep 27, 2014"

3.22,-14.6,2.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer, but I didn't think it was a good example of a Maibock simply because it lacked the key aspects that make a Maibock different from a regular Bock and the way it stands I found this beer to pretty similar to a Dopplebock, it's not bad, just not what I expected or wanted at the moment. This beer had a nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, a little sticky, rich, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, I think I could drink the whole bottle, but I would rather split it with someone. What I like the most about this beer was the drinkability, I thought it was smooth and the sweetness wasn't too out of control. What I liked the least about this beer was that I found it to be much more Dopplebock like than Maibock like, there's no way I would be able to guess this was a Maibock if I tried it blind. I don't think I would buy this beer again especially if I was in the mood for a Maibock and I wouldn't recommend it as a good Maibock simple because it isn't one. All in all I was let sown with this one, I was expecting a Maibock and instead I got a beer that was very close to being a Dopplebock and it just wasn't fulfilling as a Maibock. It isn't my favorite Maibock and it's one of my least favorite beers from this brewery. Better luck next time guys, I think you need to go back to drawing board with this one.","StoutHunter","Apr 24, 2014"

4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"im not a bock guy, and im loving this one. pours a clean mahogonay color with a foamy tan head. smells like a barleywine at first, but some german malts happening and a molasses sweetness. flavor is a grassy springtime vibe meeting an octoberfest head on. malty and full of seasonal life. i am impressed with the complexity here, not as sweet as the nose, just a touch in the finish. a little boozy as well in the finish. mouthfeel is suitable to the beer, medium to fuller bodied and long lasting at the end. this beer went exceptionally well with fresh ground lamb burgers, packed with red onion, fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, salt, black pepper, and chilli, grilled medium rare with a double slice of swiss cheese and pine nuts, a dollop of whole grain french mustard on dutch crunch bread. bomb! a nice mixing of the seasons","StonedTrippin","Feb 01, 2012"

The flavor is SWEET malt, caramel, even a burnt grain taste evolves. There is a little bit of hop presence, but like it should does not interfere with the malt. The body is big full malt bomb. not sure of the alcohol, but if I were to guess I would say around 6% (the site here says 6.3%, but not on the label in FL). The alcohol is well hidden.

Medium body, a well rounded, complex brew for the style and ABV. So much going on, really enjoy this beer more and more, wish it wasn't almost gone. Thicker tasting than it looks and thicker tasting compared to most Maibocks if that makes sense. I can't say anything bad about this beer, worth the low $ tag and worth seeking out.

The beer is light up front, akin to the promise of summer, but still rich and satiating at the same time, like the winter just passed. Definitely fits nicely as a spring time brew; it has all the malty goodness of a Bock, yet still strikes a lightness at times on the palate that makes this ever so quaffable.","Gueuzedude","Oct 22, 2006"

4.08,8.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Bottle obtained in early July 2005 and consumed a couple days later. Pours a beige two finger active head over a mildly cloudy light brown-red liquid. Smells of bock, munich malt (mildly chalky), caramel, with a hint of chocolate. Wet sweet and very enticing, as bock is one of my favorite styles. Tastes wow. Munich malt and caramelly delicious. Not quite the rounded caramel character I recall when drinking bocks over in Germany last year, but pretty close. Munich malt is the primary flavor that persists throughout. Once the munich is established, caramel rises and fades as well as a flatness, like that of bland apple meal. During the swallow, there is a millisecond of gentle alcohol hot accompanied by a more noticable carbonation release. Plus, a tang catches on for a short ride, but then fades as a gentle and smooth chocolatey aftertaste rises. While wet and sweet, the flat of my tongue has a string from miniscule carbonation and my mouth is dry from the 'chalky' of the munich malt. Hop bitter is low such that I can't detect any underneat the carb and alcohol stings. Hops flavor is very mild and present only as a floral aftertaste in the back of my throat. The head has settled to islands of sticky clogs floating on the surface. Medium-thick body and mildly (but sharply) carbonated. Get rid of the tang in the aftertaste and this is a really nice bock.","mentor","Jul 10, 2005"
