Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, toffee, and nut aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, caramel, and nut flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 14, 2013"

The initial taste of the Bucking Bock was bracingly bitter as I was expecting nothing but heavy malts. As the beer warmed the bitterness faded but was still present. I am not sure if they were going for a hoppier Maibock but in terms of the style, the bitterness could be tamed. In the end the Bucking Bock was still an enjoyable beer although overly bitter for the style, and the higher than usual ABV made me forget all about the bitterness.","brurevu","Jul 27, 2013"

3.97,16.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste has a nice balance of grain, sweetness and drying hops. Light caramely sweetness is nice, pretty true to style. I am surprised by the low overall grade this beer has, I think it is a tasty helles bock, maybe a little lower on the hops than many of the American renditions, but I prefer that in a bock anyway.

3.95,15.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This the first pale bock I have had and was pretty impressed with the style. It had a nice honey color with medium lacing and fingers. Definetly reminded me of a helles bock. Head was light with low retention. It had a nice aroma of grass, lemon and malts. First taste you get is citrusy followed with some earthy tones from the hops and finishes a slighty dry. Had a good feel in the mouth with light carbonation and a nice crisp finish. Was a tad thin but nothing to be disappointed about. A good overall beer for my first pale bock.","brewdenver","Apr 17, 2011"
3.75,9.6,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, I picked this up from Central Market in Fort Worth while we were staying with a friend. The beer pours an orange-gold coloring with a thick, light, foamy white head that quickly settles into a layer of film. Lots of carbonation bubbles present in the brew. Citrusy sweet smells with some light spicing. Flavors are dynamic, with slight citrus, caramel sweet, and light coriander spice characteristics. The beer has a semi-sour aftertaste, with a lingering finish. A little rough at the end, which is a hit to an otherwise decent beer.","GarthDanielson","Apr 03, 2011"

The taste is also very sweet, lots of bready flavor with some bitter lemon hops on the back of the tongue. The beer is kind of heavy, the alcohol is detectable, and it has a nice lingering finish.

Great body, with a medium mouthfeel that is nearly carbonated to the point of excessiveness, but pulls back just in time to achieve a smooth finish. Drinkability works well, too, and the 7.5% ABV is barely noticable.

3.62,5.8,4,4.5,3.5,3,3,"As a congratulations to another Texas brewery placing in the World Beer Cup (third place, German Style Helles / Maibock), I figured I should get around to reviewing this one. Pours a golden honey hue with a light, white head that falls to a thin film across the beer. Smells great, hints of apple, honey, and rounded, earthy buscuit malt goodness! Taste is spot on for a maibock, nothing overly offensive, even the earthy malt balances out with hints of red grape juice and sweet honey. Such a nice change from the dopplebocks of winter seasonal. Mouthfeel is ok, a bit overcarbonated but finishes crisp and dry. I wish the abv was a percent or two lower so I could drink a few more of these on a sunday afternoon, but a very solid offering from one of Texas' newest breweries.","RickSawyer","Mar 04, 2008"

Taste exhibits a fuller depth of malt flavor, and the fruitiness I was worried about has moved on before getting into my mouth. No evidence of 8%abv in the flavor or aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice, but would benefit from a tad more carbonation, and drinkability is reasonably good as well. This brew left me a bit wanting for what could have been.","ppoitras","Jul 23, 2006"
3.83,12,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D- Very smooth. If I wouldn't get hammered from drinking more than two, I would drink this all the time. Very big beer without being to heavy. Goes down too easy, watch yourself. I started to lose fealing in my legs.","teg8612","Jul 23, 2006"
3.92,14.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I definitely think that it is the best so far to come out of the Rahr brewery. I am always shy of anything that has the words "Bock" and "Texas" on the same label, as this is normally a bastardization of an American Dark Lager at best. This beer actually fits the bill of a Maibock. I personally think that the mash was a little short on this brew as it has a bit of a bite that can be mashed out, but still it is a drinkable beer that is to style. I would try this one again.","SkeeterHawk","Jul 04, 2006"
3.48,1.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Color is honey golden. Head is very small and has no retention. Aroma is weak and consists of a sweet grainy smell. Taste is moderately sweet, with a lightly toasted malt. An edge of grain is noted. A mild herbal hop flavor is in the mix as well. There is a faint hint of alcohol in the finish. The overall flavor here is pretty good, but a stronger malt body would improve this beer.","Gagnonsux","Jun 25, 2006"

3.24,-5.3,4,2.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours a dark honey with a foamy, thin head. Head dispates quickly. Smells extremely sweet, grainy, and malty. Not terribly impressed. Pleasant malt and grain in the taste with hints of honey and, I think, white grapes. Mouthfeel is slightly dense from the alcohol and not overly carbonated. Drinkability is decent.","goochpunch","Apr 29, 2006"
3.55,3.8,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"It's a subdued golden color out of the bottle. Little head. Light, malty aroma, but not much else is discernible. However the taste is quite pleasant. Deeply malty with a light and crisp finish, the high alcohol content of this beer is very deceptive. Not a session beer, although you could easily want to make it one. I believe that Rahr may have finally hit the nail on the head with this one. It's a seasonal keeper. Nicely done.","Atlas1","Apr 19, 2006"

3.98,16.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Umm...seroiusly, I need a case of this beer for further review. Wow this is one tight lady. A strong bock that I didn't even know was 8% until it was buzzing around my head. Amber-brown with a dense white cap that laces the whole glass. Smell is a little muted but there is a nice toasty malt and sweetness there. The flavor is a kick that is full of potent toasty, bready malt flavors and it has a little underlying hop bite that brings it back. Nice melding and the aftertaste last a good spell without any really noticable boozy qualities. NIce med-full body, but very drinkable.","Higravity","Mar 15, 2006"
3.87,13.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This brew has an extremely clean finish to it. Mid to low carbonation and mild hopping only further increase the drinkability factor of this slippery, light bodied brew. This drinkabiliy comes at the expense of mouthfeel somewhat. Flavor is well balanced and nonintrusive. Supple hops are barely perceivable as the malt carries most of the focus. In summary this is an extremely drinkable beer. If it wasn't for the price this could be a staple in my session lineup.","sinistermadman","Mar 10, 2006"

3.9,14,3,3,4,4,5,"Pours a clear gold color. Head starts out at about two fingers but has low retention and no lacing. Smell is pretty clean, sweet malt with little to no hop. Taste is fairly simple. Nice malt that lasts FOREVER in the aftertaste. Very slight hop shows up near the end. Like Paul I find it very hard to taste the alcohol in this one. Overall this is a very well put together beer, extremely drinkable.","hobbes2112","Beers"
3.98,16.4,3.5,3,4,4.5,5,"[edit] After the first batch, Fritz tinkered with the recipe just a little. Slightly darker (more of a copper color), a touch maltier, maybe a faint metallic element. Good/bad balances out, so I'm leaving the numbers the same.","assurbanipaul","0"
