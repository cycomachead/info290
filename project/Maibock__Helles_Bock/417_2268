Fits the style of a Maibock / Helles Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, and slight roasted malt, and very slight hop.

A smooth, flavorful, impressing beer. The mouthfeel is big and heavy, yet it consistently goes down smooth. Drinkability is excellent, expecially when considering the heavy feel. Surely recommended.","jasonpeckins32","Jul 05, 2007"
3.75,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"i was confused to see this described as bock, as it poured a pale gold in the glass--but have since learned that maibocks are less malty than traditional bocks. lots of floral, hoppy aroma but not obnoxiously hoppy in the mouth. very drinkable, and dangerously so at 7% abv. very active carbonation. holds its thin head for quite a while. a great beer for a lazy weekend afternoon on the back porch.","daaru","Jul 04, 2007"

3.63,1.1,3.5,3,4,3,4,"This beer by Schell's gives their Firebrick Lager a run for its money. Brownish amber in color, slight head. The smell is a bit sweet, of pale and caramel malts. Initially the flavor is a bit grain like, toasted caramel and toffee flavor, but it has a great finish, almost similar to drinking an apple cider, rather sweet and fruity. This is a solid Mai Bock, quite drinkable for the style, I could have more than 2 or 3, but it wont knock your socks off.","dfried","May 03, 2006"

4.15,15.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Light shade of copper. Nice clarity. Medium sized dirty white head. Lacing is moderate. Thick juicy malts on the nose. And fruits...grapes and apples come to mind. Nice, sweet aroma. This leads into a nice, sweet flavor profile. With a lot of the same in common with the nose. The apples and grapes and also pears are noticeable. And sweet, sweet malts...without being cloying. Hops only provide balance and are undetectable, save for a slight dryness to the finish. The body is full and round and the carbonation delicate. Probably my favorite offering from Schell's, with the possible exception of their Hefe.","Bighuge","Oct 27, 2004"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Much different then I remember the on-tap version being. Malt levels are very in-your-face and almost has a "raw" feeling to it. Alcohol is also very present in the taste. I would almost say this could be a candidate for aging for a year, perhaps I'll buy a 12'er and drink one every month for a year. Still worth trying, and I recommend it to anyone.","TastyTaste","Sep 27, 2004"
3.65,1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sweet, caramelly, brandy malt flavors up front, but these are tempered by some bitter, vegetal hops. Overall, more on the bitter side (for a maibock). Malt gets reduced to a vegetable/carrot flavor near the end. Finish stays bitter. Full/big body, and almost too mouth-coating.","alexgash","Jun 27, 2004"
3.75,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,3,"Drinkability and overall: I liked this one. Again, with Schell, they are good beer but there is a macro feel to them. I can't put my finger on it but I just can't taste the attention to detail with these beers like I do other craft beers. I know that's very subjective but that's the best way I know how to describe it. A good but not great beer.","mattcrill","Jun 02, 2004"

4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Super crystal clear agate amber color with a puffy finger high head of off-white foam that fizzes away fairly quickly to a thin all-over skim, lacing drips back in quick leaving very minimal spots. Aroma is highly sweet of fresh bagel dough and lighter caramelness with vanilla, dulled grasses, and slight banana esters underneath. Taste is more of the same, with a very sweet and malty charge from front to back thats dulled of fruity-candyish waffer cookie things with small hints of grassy herbal spices peaking around the edges of the palate. Some grainy-sweet corn like sweetness mixes in there at a non-threatning level. Always keeps a decent balance of malty sweetner. Slightly crisp and drying in the finish, medium body feel, but overall slightly chewy and buttery slick, but in a light way not heavy. This was surprising to say the least, quite tasty and refreshing, one I'l have again....and again...","tavernjef","May 17, 2004"

Nothing horrible, but not the best blended brew.","Tballz420","Apr 21, 2004"

3.86,7.5,4,3,4,4,4.5,"A creamy off-white head rests lazily above a clear golden-amber body as very fine-bubbles rise steadily upwards. The head holds quite well, and it maintaina a solid covering throughout most of the glass. Additionally, the lacing is nice except that it doesn't seem able to stick to the glass and disappears momentarily. The nose reveals a limited amount of malt, some mild fermentation esters, and a light note of alcohol. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth due to it's full body and very fine, moderate carbonation. A rich, grainy malt displays a light touch of toastiness and some mild fruitiness in the flavor; and it's well-balanced by a low level bitterness that barely emerges except to help dry the finish along with a wash of alcohol. The alcohol is somewhat apparent, however, and tends to intrude half-way through the glass. Still, it's a decent example of the style and could readily be enjoyed as one of the first beers of spring.","NeroFiddled","0"
3.18,-11.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours to a hazy deep golden color. The head fades to a ring. The aroma is yeasty, spicy, and caramel malty. The flavor has the caramel malts, spicy hop flavor, and a bit of alcohol. This as an okay beer, not up to par with other maibocks. It is a definite warmer; medium-bodied and easy drinking for its strength.","BeerBuilder","Apr 11, 2003"

This is a very heavily malted beer, with a caramel taste, that is somewhat grainy and processed. There is a pleasant smoky aftertaste that brings the taste score up a little. Easy drinking, but I’ve had better manifests lately.","jackndan","Mar 12, 2003"

Yeasty vanilla aromas, subtle. Malty flavors predominate as expected -- best described as leaning toward gingerbread in quality, with a bit of bitter marmalade mid mouth. Finishes in a similar vein with some artificial caramel aftertaste. Hops may contribute slightly to the bitter orange sense. Overall, thin mouthfeel for a beer described as a "Blonde Double Bock", but an OK Lager overall.","ADR","Nov 30, 2002"
