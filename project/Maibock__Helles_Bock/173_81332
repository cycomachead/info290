4.4,14.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"One of my favorites while spending time at Hair of the Dog, very fruity and refreshing taste, by far the lightest looking beer I had tried. Tastes of very sweet fruits, a little bit of citrus, and very smooth hiding the alcohol. Goldish cloudy color but brighter and thinner looking than usual. Very satisfying, tried in a flight sampler.","BigJYoungblood","Jul 18, 2013"

3.82,-0.8,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"The toasted grain character on the palate does make this beer unique. Less sweet than most, there's a blend of toffee, grain, honey and toast. The midpalate has a moderate hoppiness, mildly earthy and a touch minty. Mildly sweet on the finish, this beer is outstandingly soft and creamy on the palate. Very nice stuff.","DefenCorps","Jun 13, 2013"

3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 26, 2012"

4.06,5.5,5,4,4,4,4,"O: Quite the lager, and certainly not what you might expect heading in, even if it is a maibock, particularly where it comes to the heaviness of the beer. There's a really good mesh between the nose and the tongue, and I'm sure this is going to be a regular on my visits to the taproom assuming it's not a one-off.","Sarlacc83","May 18, 2012"

I'm no expert in the style but this was excellent! Very glad I got to try/add this one to the database...","hopwave","0"
