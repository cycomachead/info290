2.46,-25.9,3,2.5,2,3.25,2.75,"I popped the cap and before I could make the pour, I had a small cap of head sneaking its way up through the neck of the bottle! Being that it was that carbonated, I employed a more gentle pour than I might have otherwise. The dense two-finger cap of French Vanilla-colored head looked like the top of an ice cream float, perfect for the approach of summer. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose smelled strongly of Saaz hops, kind of skunky, catty, you get the idea. Mouthfeel was thick and viscous and the taste of the hops was a) off and b) much too heavy for the style. Finish retained a sharpness from the hops that rendered it fairly unpleasant in total. Another swing and a miss for this brewery.","woodychandler","Jun 02, 2013"

3.47,4.5,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Dirty orange in color with yellowish hues on the edge of the glass. Very murky. Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a solid white cap. Toasted and biscuit malt flavors with light earthy hop and buttery notes. Medium bodied, a creamy feel through the middle with rich carbonation and a clean finish. Toasted and biscuit malt flavors up front. Bitter flavors build through the middle to the end, but the hop flavor lacks character.

3.53,6.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a six pack on sale for $6.99. Poured into a Brit style pint glass. Bottled in March 2012. Bright yellow orange color. Good lacing on the glass. Clear body with good carbonation. Smell had a hint of grapefruit and musty hay. Taste was good, as I liked the really malty flavor. Mouthfeel was a bit on the sticky side, though. I found this maibock to be a pretty smooth beer to drink considering the well hidden abv. Not a bad find for the price and with that strength, it held up pretty well over the course of spring into summer.","morebeergood","Jul 05, 2012"

4.47,34.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I have to say that I was pretty surprised with this beer and I ended up really liking it and I thought it was a pretty damn good Maibock, I don't have any experience with this style but I really like the fact that it is suppose to be a drinkable spring beer, flavorful but light enough to enjoy a few during the day while chilling outside, this beer has inspired me to seek out more of this style and try some traditional Maibocks. This beer was super drinkable, it never lasts long in my glass and goes great with some grilling outside and it paired great with some beer brats, I could drink a six pack of this throughout the day if I wanted to, as far as Bocks go I don't think they get much more drinkable then this. What I liked most about this beer was everything, this beer was firing on all cylinders and I thought every aspect was well done. There wasn't anything I didn't like about this beer, I couldn't find anything at all that was wrong with it, which isn't all that common. I will be buying more of this and have already got another six pack, I think everyone should give this beer a try, even my mom liked it and that doesn't happen often. I was really impressed with this beer, Atwater has a way of disappointing me a couple times in a row and just when I start to lower my expectations they come out of nowhere with an unexpectedly great beer, and that was the case with this beer, a very pleasant surprise. I can't say enough good things about this beer, and I am glad I took a chance on it, good job guys, this may be my choice beverage of the spring. So far this is my favorite Maibock, and one of my favorite beers from Atwater. All in all a great beer","StoutHunter","Feb 20, 2012"

Tastes sweet and bready, maybe yeasty, with a decent feel to it. Smooth and easy, a carbonation level to my preference, more moderate to low from this experience. I could barely believe the %ABV on this one because it was a very easy drink. It seems a very average beer, but there's an easiness to it that'l' have me order it again next time I see it, or pick it up if I see it in a bottle.

3.23,-2.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Quite a tasty little brew. There are a lot of very sweet fruit flavors: pears, peaches, apples, and appricots. Very candied with confectionate sugars. The nose suggests that this beer is too sweet to enjoy, but the delicate candied malts and fruits prove otherwise. The appearance worried me at first with an over-carbonated pour that led me to think that an infection may have occured, but this was not the case. A bold, white, loose-knit head formation reminded me a bit of Duvel, but the retention proved to be merely mortal. The beer feels a bit syrupy sweet, leaving it not well attenuated so the mouthfeel gives up what the rich flavors gain. I get only a subtle corn taste late that most BA's describe as dominant- perhaps the 6 months+ age has helped out. Finishes sweet, a bit tacky, and... well fruity-- makes me wonder the temperature or yeast that they used for fermentation. If you like sweet, low-hopped ales, this may be up your alley.","BEERchitect","Jul 26, 2008"
1.6,-51.8,4,1.5,1.5,2,1,"I'm flabbergasted that Atwater Block continues to keep their doors open. Mai-Bock is my seventh brew from this brewery and is the worst of a very nasty lot. What are the odds that I've gotten ahold of seven (seven!) bad bottles... from three different stores... in two different states... at two separate times? Since Cold Spring (formerly Gluek) has improved some of their products, I hereby nominate these guys for America's worst microbrewery. Gack!","BuckeyeNation","May 31, 2008"
2.67,-19.6,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Not sure what I was expecting with this beer. Atwater has let me down in the past, but this beer is different. It's not bad by any means. The golden color is offset by the huge white head that sticks around forever - it took me at least an hour to drink this and the head never faded. There is plenty of carbonation, but that is subdued with time. Tropical fruit is on the nose - pineapple and maybe some banana. The taste is harder to place with nondescript flavors that are kind of mashed together, but it is distinctly sweet with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is fine - a little syrupy, but nothing great. It took me a while to finish this one and not because it's a sipper necessarily. The ABV is 7.5%, which is big enough to warrant sipping, but this beer does not get much better as it warms. A decent offering. Mild recommendation.","montageman","May 07, 2008"
3.6,8.4,4,4,3,4,4,"As Maibocks go, this is ok. Not the best, but come on...it is not an F. You MN boys must have had a 6 pack that was over exposed to light or something...I know the Atwater folks well, and they make decent beer. Not anything worthy of an F.","Pointman","May 04, 2008"
1.06,-68.1,2,1,1,1,1,"Golden body. Very hazy. LOTS of CO2 bubbles apparant. Big frothy rocky white head. (All signs that maybe this is a bit too carbonated.) Chemical smell of sulfur and of an electrical fire. Awful aroma. Carbonation is too high. The electrical fire aroma translates nicely over to the palate (or not nicely in this case). This beer is highly flawed. This is the first beer I will actually pour down the drain in years.","Bighuge","Apr 04, 2008"

Lightish body, pleasantly active carbonation makes for a very refreshing brew.
