More flavorful than the aroma would lead you to believe with apple, sugar, grain, and cracker, followed by a subtle hop finish.

There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Fades rather quickly, leaving just a bit of lacing. Aroma has some rich pilsner malt sweetness, mild grassy hops and some mineral character. Little bit of apple cider. Pears, very light lemons, mild floral note. It's a clean bock with a bit more sweetness than appley sweetness than expected. The taste has more of the same sweet pilsner malt flavor with that sweet apple note. It finishes drier than I would have guessed based on the aroma. Simple sugar. Mild grass hops, again. Mild bitterness in the finish, which could stand to be a bit cleaner. Sweet and simple breadiness. Relatively low carbonation. Round mouthfeel, almost a bit much given the lack of complexity. Fun to see a one-off from Paulaner in the US, but it's still just a decent bock. I can't complain. I'd love to see more German specials around.","popery","Jun 26, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of honey, cracker, bread, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of honey, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Light amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, cracker, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Maibock style. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV.
