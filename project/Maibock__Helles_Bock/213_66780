Poured into a Smithwicks Draught mug and was rewarded with a nice off white collar of rocky foam about 3 fingers high sitting over clear medium amber/gold beer. I get sweet malt, a nutty, and grassy note, fragrant and flowery yet subtle hoppiness in the nose. Average mouthfeel. Superbly balanced, neither very sweet or very bitter...layer of malt backing gives way to the hop bitterness, just enough to let you know it's there but not the dominant flavor. Finishes flowery-bitter with a biscuity flourish. Very nice take on the Bock style and well worth the effort to find it. Love the can graphics too. See it? Buy it!","beerluvr","May 03, 2013"

There is very little foam and minimal lacing. The nose is roasty malts and lots of warm bready, very nice example of the style. The flavor mirrors the nose in lots of roasty malt and bready goodness. This is a wonderful beer for the price and a not so common style. Big props to Narragansett for making a very nice example.","Bowdoinbeerboy","Apr 09, 2013"

In the end, however, it’s rather light, coming across not as watery, but simply weak, the flavors fading out quickly over the course of even a few sips.

Flavors are rich and robust, with a strong caramel and toffee malt presence throughout, giving rise to a roasted and slightly peppery undertone.

A beer as malt forward as this could, and many do, turn almost cough medicine tasting, but they do a nice job of letting the malt be the star without giving a syrupy sensation. This is a very successful beer, and in fact one I would encourage because it is good and because it breaks a lot of stereotypes.","Kyrgyzbrewer","Mar 04, 2012"

As I take the first sip, clean, crisp flavor washes over the tongue. Rich notes of caramel, almost clove like spice and loads of grainy grasses wash over the tongue.

The beer is crystal-clear, somewhere between gold and amber, with medium carbonation and a fluffy tan head that is easily teased above the rim and leaves a bit of lacing. Smells very "lagery" - clean and malty, with a dash of hops and distinct yeast. Quite malty on the palate, grainy and lightly sweet, with notes of biscuits, fresh bread and a bit of husk. Full-bodied as well, dry and crisp, with some apple esters, light hops and a dash of alcohol that leads into a malty finish. This is a very approachable beer that is solidly in the hellesbock profile. It's easy-drinking, pleasant, affordable and somewhat local to Boston.

This time, it resulted in two fingers of thick, fluffy eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a malty sweetness underlain by a sharp peppery scent. Mouthfeel was full, not quite creamy, but close. I let a mouthful just roll around on my tongue, getting an initial caramel sweetness from it, followed by some black pepper, probably from the yeast strain. Finish was clean, as advertised, with a literally breathtaking dryness. Another winnah from the Ocean State!

Pours a translucent copper with a slightly golden hue and a rocky, three inch cream-colored head that exposes dense, concentric rings of lacing as it slowly dissipates. Nose expresses candied, fruity esters, a faint herbal or grassy quality and a trace of noble hops towards the back. Taste is less sweet than suggested by the nose - a slightly spicy character intersperses itself throughout the flavor profile, along a light malty backbone, culminating in a residual earthy hops finish. Mouthfeel is light with a lively carbonation and a slightly oily quality. Definitely one of my favorite Bock beers and you can't beat the price at $7.99 a sixer.
