3.53,13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, dark fruits. Taste is the same. Malty, sweet, dark fruits, just a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid and enjoyable beer.","tone77","Dec 24, 2014"

3.77,20.8,3,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Overall I enjoyed this though it's a bit on the lighter side for a bock. It isn't a super complex Bock if you're looking to really go big, but makes up for it with good balance and being very drinkable so is a good change of pace from pale ales and lagers for a everyday drinker. Check the inside of the six pack for a date after Nov. 2012 though to make sure you get the newer batches.","HiGravShawn","Jan 01, 2013"

3.25,4.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Taste was fairly mild. A nice malty nutty bock presence with slight bittering from citrus and earthy yeast notes. This is an easy drinking beer with more flavor than the bmc, but nothing overwhelming. It is pretty weak in flavor for a bock.","Chickenhawk9932","Jul 23, 2012"

3.5,12.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours golden with a two-finger length white head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen streaming up from the bottom of the glass, indicating this beer is very carbonated. The aroma is sweet with malt and fruity esters. It's bready and clean smelling. There are flavors of sweet, bready malts. There are minor fruity notes with some mildly bitter hops in the finish. There is a minor bitter aftertaste. The body medium to full with plentiful carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. It is definitely worth a try if you're looking for beer made in Louisiana.","acevenom","Apr 23, 2012"

2.98,-4.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Picked up a sixer at Rouses. I was hoping for a traditional bock, but I'll takes a helles. But is this a helles? There's a mild cookie note, that actually reminds me a lot of Heiner Brau's Oktoberfest, but cleaner. There's a little lemon in the finish, but the typical sweet fruit and big malts are missing. This is just pale lager with a little extra malt.","tempest","Aug 13, 2011"

3.57,14.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Atmosphere is ok. Body characterized by constant carbonation, a quickly dissipating head, and no lacing though. Nose is really nutty, with a pungent malty tone and just a bit of citrus and floral hints. Flavor is very nutty with a bit of a floral sweetness, and syrupy body. Overall, this is a good quaff.","bmwats","May 21, 2011"
2.91,-6.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Thanks to Tolann and her friends for sharing beers a month or so back at her basement party. This one poured a golden color with a smallish white head.

3.2,2.6,3,3,3,3,4,"It tastes similar to a kolsch. It isn't very strong flavored and is best suited to sessions. However, it isn't really watery. It isn't bad, but is just a step above the typical American macro brews.","megahurts4","Apr 23, 2010"

Unlike the pilsner, I could pass on another of this one, though the sessionable weight and good-enough flavor makes this a better option than much of the local options in SELA. Still Abita and upstart NOLA probably could best this brew.","msubulldog25","0"
