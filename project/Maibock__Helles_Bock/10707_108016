3.95,13.2,3.75,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Of all of the Trader Joe's beers this is probably my favorite (with the exception of their Vintage Ale and Providential Golden Ale made by Unibroue). It's a clean, straightforward helles bock that's got just the right amount of maltiness to it so that it's not too thin, too full, or too sticky. And it's got some decent floral and spicy hops in the flavor as well. The head retention and lacing could be a bit better, the aroma could be slightly fuller, and perhaps the malt quality itself, but as far as American brewed versions of the style go it's top-notch. With that said, just getting a malty 7% abv beer for $1.17 ($28 for a case) is next to impossible!","NeroFiddled","Dec 21, 2014"

3.11,-10.9,3.5,3,3,3.75,3,"Overall- I'm not familiar with this style and what to compare it to, but its a decent beer that at the very least is an easy drinker if something simple is desired.  Solid malt flavor, but the hops are way too spiced up.  Worth drinking if ya got it for free, but certainly not something I'd paid for or recommend. (71/100)","CTbrew32","Sep 17, 2014"

3.7,6,,,,,,"Poured from a bottle into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium coppery amber with a thin white head that dissipates to light patches and thin ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet caramel and bready malt, hints of lemon and toffee. Flavor is sweet caramel malt, light lemon and toffee and grassy hops. Medium bodied with light carbonation. An adequate, mild take on a heller bock without much character to the hops, hits the right notes in the malt profile. Delivers on its purpose: an inexpensive, nicely made domestic  heller bock.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2014"

However, given the price of trader joe's beers (5.99 a sixer at my local place), if you like helles bocks, this is a perfectly fine choice. I don't mind breaking the tie based on price when all else is equal in beer selection.","AlCaponeJunior","Apr 01, 2014"

Grassy, herbal hops dominate the palate; bready malt and grain provide some balance. Finish is long, herbal. Not very good brew with unpleasant hops profile.
