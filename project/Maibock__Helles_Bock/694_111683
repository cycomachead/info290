Malty, slightly bitter - almost a perfect balance between malt and hops - neither dominates.  Medium, smooth mouthfeel.  Really nice, clean finish.

A bit more malt sweetness to balance the hops would yield a world class flavor rating.  It begins with herbal hop flavor over a mild biscuit sweetness.  As the middle approaches, light caramel notes emerge.  The middle brings a mild bitterness over a slight mineral like note.  The finish is a slow fade into biscuit and bitterness over a mineral note that is somewhat dry and crisp.","tillmac62","Mar 24, 2015"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep gold color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, toast, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, toast, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, toast, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean flavor profile as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Helles bock! All around great balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth, clean, and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 10, 2014"

Clearish gold body with well-carb'd, fizzy two finger head that dies quick with minor lace patches on top of aroma that is a little bit of soapy, dirty hops and some grainy malts with that bread/cracker edge that seems to be a familiar descriptive term. The basic taste is a dry, cracker-like graininess but the balance is there from some floral hops so this doesn't turn into some American macro crap. The hops give off minor citric and the malts seem to have a touch of sweetness to them. Easy to drink and refreshing and you can't ask for much more.","clayrock81","Apr 19, 2014"

Taste has slight hop bitterness, slightly bready, with a semi-creamy mouthfeel. Mostly clean finish- there's a slight lingering hop presence on the palate. This is really a fantastic well-rounded beer and a great stateside example of the Maibock/Helles Bock style, perfect for spring. I will be searching this out again.","xungmound98","Apr 11, 2014"

Has a Hells lager flavor profile with a little more sweetness and a little more hop finish than most German contemporaries. This is a fine beer by Troegs. This also is the best Helles Bock I've sampled to date. I will definitely look to buy more of this one.","bubseymour","Feb 24, 2014"

4.25,10.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Golden orange body beautifully filtered with a big white head chunky textured billowing above the rim of my pint glass. Aroma has bread yeast, biscuit malt, herbal earthy grass hop notes this is a nice smelling helles bock so far. Cereal grains, honey biscuit malts, grassy herbal hop finish this is a perfect beer borders on the sweetness of other high gravity lagers like malt liquors maybe a touch of green apple, but no residual sticky sweetness at all this is great beer tried and true. This reminds me of a version I had years ago the Penn Maibock on a kick the keg night at Fuel and Fuddle the drafts of Penn Maibock were marked down to 2 dollars and the whole bar was drinking this classic style with big smiles and laughter abound. Everybody had fun even if we were over indulging that night!!! Sugary glazed biscuit malts bring the flavor together with a nutty apple character in the malt department, again I love this beer, carbonation is full on and built into such said beer. Overall this beer brings back memories of a better time in the beer scene when Penn Maibock, Stoudt's Maibock, and Victory St. Boisterous tuned into the beer drinking scene also Sierra Nevada recently d/c'd their famous helles bock that was once a seasonal.","WVbeergeek","Feb 17, 2014"

4.07,5.7,4.25,4,4,4,4.25," The taste is as good as the other qualities mentioned above yet there is a smooth grain flavor with light sweet maltiness and gentle German yeast flavor in the middle with floral hop and mild alcohol in the finish which is relatively dry. Overall I consider this a pretty high quality helles bock for the style, very drinkable yet enough strength to hold true with the original ...very drinkable example with nice balance.","Slatetank","Feb 02, 2014"
