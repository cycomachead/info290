Maibocks are underappreciated in general, I believe, and this one is a pretty good example of style that is highly drinkable and great with most food.","crob3888","Mar 28, 2015"

3.59,1.7,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, but it still had some aspects that I found to not be that inline with the style, but they weren't too overpowering so it was still identifiable as a Maibock and in the end I liked it.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, a little on the sweet side, a little crisp, slightly filling and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I think could drink a couple of these but after that the sweetness might start to be too much.  What I like the most about this beer was that the alcohol was well hidden and it was still fairly true to style.  What I like the least about this beer is the appearance, it could use a little work.  I might buy this beer again if I couldn't find the Maibocks that I like more.  I can't say I would recommend this as a great Maibock, but I think it's still worth trying.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, it just had a few things that seemed a little out of place.  This isn't my favorite Trade Joe beer and it's slightly above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a nice Maibock, especially for the price, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 21, 2015"

3.78,7.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a reddish coppery amber with a fine half finger ivory head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is quite bready malt with hint of rye bread, hints of caramel and nuts. Flavor is sweet biscuit and bready malt, grassy German style hops, hay. Nice creamy medium body. A slightly sweet, but overall well balanced malty maibock with tradtional hops that give this a nice finish. A quite well done inexpensive maibock, and possibly my favorite among the Josephs Brau line. Better than expected and something I'd buy again in a pinch.","LiquidAmber","Mar 19, 2014"

Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. I am also getting a weird beef jerky aroma as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with metallic and vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with some odd aromas and flavors that make it very tough to force down.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 31, 2013"
