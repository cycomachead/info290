2.82,-35.5,2,2.5,3,3,3,"OVERALL: Like the base beer, this is no better than okay. The adjunct character is interesting enough, but the base stout is rather weak and the barrel aging is pretty mundane. Still, these pairs are always fun to try and I’d say this one was slightly more interesting than the base beer, so that’s something at least. Cheers again for the brews SiddFinch!","Jeffo","Mar 11, 2015"
