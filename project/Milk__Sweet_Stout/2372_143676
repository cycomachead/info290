3.31,-19.5,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours black with deep tan head that held fairly well before fading into a medium collar.  Aroma is sweet milk, coffee, milk chocolate, and roasted malts; but not much else.  Taste is like milk chocolate coffee water.  Pretty thing, and sticky in the mouth.  Carbonation is very low.","mverity","Mar 02, 2015"
