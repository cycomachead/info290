There is definitely roasted espresso, dark chocolate and a bit of bread on the nose.  At first I don't get much flavour but there is that espresso and chocolate in the aftertaste that lingers for a short time.  Funny enough that as it warms up the flavour profile does change a bit almost reminding me of a cold Double Double from your local coffee shop.  The carbonation balances the mouthfeel down a notch to a high medium.  I think this one of those beers that would benefit as a nitro just to smooth it out a bit more.","Svingjo","Mar 15, 2015"
