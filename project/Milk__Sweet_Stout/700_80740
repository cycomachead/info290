There is definitely roasted espresso, dark chocolate and a bit of bread on the nose.  At first I don't get much flavour but there is that espresso and chocolate in the aftertaste that lingers for a short time.  Funny enough that as it warms up the flavour profile does change a bit almost reminding me of a cold Double Double from your local coffee shop.  The carbonation balances the mouthfeel down a notch to a high medium.  I think this one of those beers that would benefit as a nitro just to smooth it out a bit more.","Svingjo","Mar 17, 2015"

Carbonation bubbles can be seen bursting through the surface...  The color is a deep brown that allows a bit of light to leak in around the edges providing a light reddish hue of undertones...  The aroma is exactly as expected and rather enjoyable...  Mild espresso is at the forefront of each and every whiff...  Next in line is the roasted malt...  Finally there are hints of vanilla and caramel...  The flavor profile is much more muted than I would have expected based on the stellar aroma...  Everything seems to be watered down a notch or two...  On the lighter side of medium bodied...  Some fizzy carbonation to start...  Chalky throughout...  Has some characteristics similar to espresso (minus the carbonation)...  Not a bad beer, but nothing to memorable either...

3.97,0.8,4.25,4,4,4,3.75,"Not sure how this one ended in my fridge but for some reason a stout was sounding good. Already drank a Belgian Bomber so not sure if that will affect my review of this one. Outstanding looking beer with a good treat to the nose, although coffee is the most prominent smell. Taste, really smooth with strong Coffee taste but nothing overwhelming. Overall a very good beer that is reasonably easy to drink but with the low ABV I expected more, I actually dinged it overall due to low ABV. To much coffee for that ABV in my opinion. While it is a very good beer I would be not probably revisit, although if you were a stout, and especially a coffee stout fan then this may interest you.","JamieDuncan","May 13, 2014"

It is the ideal post prandial brew, not a bit of bitterness, just rich, creamy, silky smooth, eminently quaffable, but why hurry? This is a brew to be sipped and savored until the very last drop.

3.62,-8.1,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Been interested in this one. Pours a nice black coffee with a bit of light mocha foam and no lace. Smells of coffee and hints of lactose sweetness. The coffee is bold and almost spicy with hints of soil and tobacco - nice nose. Flavor comes through delivering quite a bit of lactose sweetness, actually so much it reminds me of non-dairy creamer. Cocoa, bitterness, coffee, smooth roastyness. I like the flavor, but I can see how some would perceive it to taste "cheap". Full bodied with a reserved carbonation and wet finish. Overall decent beer, and something really approachable for all, but I wouldn't buy more than a couple times a year if always around.","harrymel","Jul 22, 2012"
3.75,-4.8,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"o - Overall this is exactly as it sounds, and a pretty good beer.

Overall, you could get one of these instead of an iced coffee at Starbucks and be just as satisfied. I don't mind roasted notes in beer, and if there is a hint of coffee to complement the the malts and grain in a beer, that's acceptable. But when the adjunct in a beer so completely overpowers the basic "Beeriness" of a beer, that beer has gone off the rails. I cannot recommend this beer to the non-coffee lover.","beertunes","Jun 11, 2012"
