I think the thin mouthfeel would classify it as such for me and with a stout it'd be thicker...overall it's a good beer especially if your looking for a coffee stout.  i'm not disappointed and have really wanted to try this but there are better representations of this style on the market.  Alewerks does produce some really good beer and I would pick those over this in their line-up.","upton7418","Feb 18, 2015"
