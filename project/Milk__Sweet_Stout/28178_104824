4.4,0.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Dark black with a thin, dark brown head.  Just a little bit of lacing.  Smell is complex, with a strong vanilla and oak character, and hints of chocolate and brown sugar.  Taste was semi-sweet chocolate and some hints of coffee, followed by a strong vanilla wave concluding in an oaky alcohol burn.  A little bit thin for a 13% stout, but the taste definitely lingers and coats the tongue.  This definitely lived up to its billing.  An outstanding barrel aged stout.","OneEye78","Mar 14, 2015"
