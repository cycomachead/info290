4.09,4.9,3.25,3.5,4.5,4,4.25,"The flavor profile is world class - intense, somewhat complex and nicely balanced.  It begins with a burst of espresso that slowly subsides to reveal a rich underlying malt sweetness with chocolate notes.  The middle has  a slight roast bitterness that fades allowing a nice burst of lemon to come forward.  The finish is a slightly sweet lingering espresso flavor that is slightly tart.  The 7.5%ABV is completely hidden.","tillmac62","Mar 28, 2015"

3.63,-6.9,3,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Served on tap into a pint glass, looked almost exactly like a flat glass of Coca-Cola, right down to the thin spotty head. Roasted coffee odor. Tastes of espresso, roasted malt, faint notes of brown sugar, finishes with quick flash of lemon peel. Mouthfeel fairly thin with a bit of creaminess. Alcohol almost completely disguised, but you start to taste it (and feel it) a few sips in. This is a beer without many flaws and without many memorable features either. I can't help but feel that pouring an splash of iced coffee with a twist of lemon in a milk stout might end up with the same result.","lipster","Mar 26, 2015"
