4.19,1.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,"Pours with a cola colored body and settles into the glass as very dark brown with a sticky cream-colored head. Aroma is vanilla right off the bat, with roasted malts and chocolate. Flavor is sweet with lots of vanilla and a nice roastiness to balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is very creamy with medium carbonation and a medium body for a higher abv milk stout. Overall a great and unique take on the style, not too sweet, very nice.","stephenjmoore","Mar 05, 2015"
