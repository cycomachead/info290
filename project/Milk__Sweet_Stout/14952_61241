4.34,1.4,3.75,4,4.75,4,4.25,"Had it on tap, so the initial pour looked fantastic but by the time I made the 30' walk back to the table, the head completely disappeared. Decent legs, but no real lacing to speak of. Nose carried a little bourbon but wasn't' an overwhelming aroma. Taste is where this thing wins (and I guess all that really matters, right?). Never had a more balanced BA stout, ever. Bourbon was certainly there but not overwhelming, little to no heat at all and not cloyingly sweet. Just a damn fine tasting beverage. Period. Other than being a little thin, this is a little jackpot of a beer!","gopens44","Feb 27, 2015"
