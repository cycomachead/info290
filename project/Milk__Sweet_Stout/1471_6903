2.07,-46.8,2.5,3,1.5,1.5,2.25,"Great roasted, malted aroma. However, it is overly roasted and bitter in flavor. It's not creamy or milky at all. Somewhat disappointed in the overall product.","cserrato02","Mar 22, 2015"

3.91,0.5,3.75,4,3.75,4.25,4,"Pours thick and rich. A very dark 1-finger head quickly falls. There's a viscous coating on the glass as it's tipped. The aroma is big and enveloping; full of deep fruity smells. The beers taste is what one might expect of a sip of dessert wine, with dry, burnt-coffee notes on the back end. This is a big stout, and I imagine it would be hard to distinguish from many imperials; quite an accomplishment for a 7.5% libation. Mouthfeel lives up to the name.","Altrurian","Mar 09, 2015"

3.84,-1.3,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours a nice light creamy brown head with decent lacing. Smell is chocolate malt, malted milk, roast marshmallows. Taste is subtle chocolate milk, nice smoke presence, with darker chocolate residuals. Overall a very nice stout that is easy to drink.","RyBrew54","Feb 27, 2015"
