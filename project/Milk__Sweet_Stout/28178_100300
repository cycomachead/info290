I like the deep dark coloring, and it has a sweet vanilla nose on it. Plus, I'm a huge fan of the label art and love that they incorporated Game Of Thrones like this. Really well done.","Ncpogs","Oct 07, 2013"

4.2,1,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"o: Very tasty milk stout from Pipeworks. I've not had many in this style but it's among the best I have had. On any given sip, the 10% is hardly detectable but it accumulates very nicely over the course of the bottle. Only quibble is I wish the vanilla was more prominent. Nicely done.","Jaycase","Oct 07, 2013"

4.14,-0.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"Poured into Upland snifter. Pours a deep brownish black with medium visual weight. Dark brown head forms upon pour and retains a thin layer. No lacing present. The nose is cacao forward with a strong influence from the lactose sugar presenting a bit of cream. Vanilla comes in at the finish and is paired with a helping of roasted malts. Taste is very chocolatey up front with roastiness picking up in intensity with each sip. The roast provides a little bitterness, but it quickly rounded out by vanilla and cream. There is a slight boozy presence at the very end which will inevitably mellow out once this beer has had a few months on it. Mouthfeel is hearty with moderate carbonation. Another tasty brew from Pipeworks!","homebrew311","Oct 03, 2013"

Great chocolatey taste, pleasant aroma I plan on picking up an extra bottle for the cellar post-haste. I might be presumptuous in saying this right now, but I believe this is the best of the stouts Pipeworks has made.","wpqx","Oct 03, 2013"
