The mouthfeel is watery. I can drink it and it's not unpleasant ... but there are far better beers out there that are easily available.","Kurmaraja","Feb 07, 2015"

2.99,-21.3,3.25,3,3,2.75,3,"Another factor for the lower rating was probably the mental comparison to a solid barrel-aged stout earlier that evening. Not fair, but just accentuated the weaknesses.","rab53","Jan 24, 2015"
4.1,7.9,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"Moo Joos pours  black with a 1‚Äù dark tan head. Roast and sweet malt with a touch of grain aromas rise from the glass. A mild sweetness runs throughout with some chocolate that lingers well into the aftertaste. The roast is mild and is moderated by a pinch of caramel. There is a little oatmeal body feel on your tongue but overall the body is little thin.","pat61","Jan 03, 2015"

2.64,-30.5,3.25,3.5,2.75,1,2,"First bottle to a tulip glass. Even though the pour was moderately aggressive, no head at all, just a tan ring. No visible carbonation. Second bottle to a pilsener glass, very aggressive pour, to better cause a head and view any carbonation. 2nd time, a 1 inch tan head, bubbly, dissipates relatively quickly with lacing. Carbonation is virtually nonexistant; an occasional bubble is visible rising up, and I have to hold it to the light to see that. After a few minutes, no visible carbonation at all. Dark brown to black color. Very nice roasted aroma. Taste follows the aroma, dominated by roasted malts, transitioning to sweetness and a touch of bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and only slightly bitter. Body is a bit thin and flat. Very flat. Overall, this is a very blah beer. Not very good at all. It is not drain-pour bad, but there is nothing special at all in this beer and the lack of mouth feel makes it really a struggle to try to enjoy. Given the reviews, I expected a lot more. I gave this beer 2 full bottles before writing this review.  While the 2nd made perhaps a slightly better impression than the first, this does rank as the worst stout/porter I've had to date, admittedly not a huge sample population, but I definitely won't be buying this one again.","MNAle","Dec 21, 2014"
