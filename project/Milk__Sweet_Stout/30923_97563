I eat peanut butter with a spoon straight from the jar so this is a real treat combining two of my favorite foods. I highly recommend trying this if you like peanut butter. Itâ€™s a great beer if you are looking for something different and enjoy the taste of peanut butter.","CHickman","Mar 22, 2015"

4.21,1.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  Lacing is left behind on the glass.  Aroma of peanut butter, cocoa and grains like Reese's puffs cereal.  The flavor starts with chocolate malts, blending into peanut flavor ending dry and toasty.  Full bodied ale with medium carbonation almost creamy.","Stinkypuss","Mar 12, 2015"

Paired this with New Glarus Belgian Red for a faux PB&J, next time will try with NG Strawberry Rhubarb for the ULTIMATE PB&J.","atone315","Mar 08, 2015"
