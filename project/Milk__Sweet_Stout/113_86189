4.91,16.1,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.75,"Explosive upon opening. Best to open standing straight up. Might be too sweet for some. Has a bubbly head but not what I expected for a stout. Still..... It's just a visual issue. Sometimes hard to pair with food. Better as a dessert beer.","TheRobotGuyLLC","Mar 29, 2015"

4.55,7.6,3.25,5,4.75,3.5,4.5,"Overall, my favorite craft beer. This is something I would show up to a friend's house with on game night so that they drink one and quit so that I can save the rest for myself. If you're not crazy about chocolate you might want to skip this one. If you are crazy about chocolate however, and happen to also love beer, this is an awesome brew. Just drink it slowly.","McGooTheWise","Mar 26, 2015"

3.3,-22,4,4,3,3,3,"Got this in a sampler pack with the India Ale and Oatmeal Stout.  Wouldn't have bought it on my own as I'm not much of a stout drinker.  As printed on the bottle... smooth chocolate flavor, not very bitter.  If that's your thing then it's a great beer.  Just OK for me.","comadiv",
