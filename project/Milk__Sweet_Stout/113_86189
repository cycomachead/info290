This is something I would show up to a friend's house with on game night so that they drink one and quit so that I can save the rest for myself. If you're not crazy about chocolate you might want to skip this one. If you are crazy about chocolate however, and happen to also love beer, this is an awesome brew.

Imagine boiling down chocolate chips and inhaling a big whiff of chocolate goodness - it is similar to the smell of SSOCS, with a hint of malt tossed in for good measure.  The dark brown brew has a modest head that shrinks to a ring of small bubbles around the outside of my glass that remaining throughout the beer.  The taste is lead by chocolate, and although it is excellent, there is a hint of something being off - a fake quality, but I am being very picky.  Mouthfeel is Smooth and silky.

4.11,-2.8,4,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style. it had everything that I look for in a Chocolate Stout and while it wasn't the most balanced I thought those nice chocolate aspects made up for it.  This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, rich, a little crisp, slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these and it would be a nice beer to enjoy during the cold weather.  What I like the most about this beer is the chocolate aspect, it's very nice and it's just what I want in a chocolate stout.  What I like the least about this beer was the sweetness, it wasn't bad, but it was just a little on the sweet side for me.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a chocolate stout and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style.  All in all I liked this beer, it isn't something that I could drink all the time, but it's nice for when I want my chocolate fix.  It's now my favorite beer from this brewery and it's one of the best chocolate stouts I've had.  Good job guys, this is one tasty beer, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 07, 2015"

Aroma is of dark Malts, milk chocolate (yes milk), biscuit, and a hint of fruit (maybe cherry?). Taste is very similar to the aroma, milk chocolate with a hint of malty/ biscuity taste at the end, nearly too sweet for my liking. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, evspdcially a chocolate stout. Overall decent, not something I'd go out of my way to get again, as say a southern tier mokah. 4/5","anthony23cippy","Mar 06, 2015"

Delicious notes of rich chocolate override aroma of roasted malts and light/weak coffee.  Toffee maybe,  caramelized sugar.  Light and not as thick or creamy in the mouth as you would like.  Thin actually.  Tastes much like it smells with the overriding taste being chocolate.  Milk chocolate.  The other flavors are buried underneath.  They fight the chocolate but fail.  Low abv.  Very drinkable.  After taste is chocolate with roasted malts and a hint of hops and malts.  Very smooth.  Delightful.","uvachief","Feb 23, 2015"
4.65,9.9,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Wow! That's it in a nutshell. Jet black in low light, the glass shows dark ruby brown clarity when held up to a brighter illumination. An egg cream like head of prodigious proportions rises up majestically leaving thick layers of lace after a flow fade. As I drink the glass shows  streaks and spots, the brew has a light covering that stays. Nose is bordering on criminally chocolate, a perfect melding of stout and and cacao. It has a lovely sweetness that makes you think the cup should have steam rising up and a marshmallow melting down inside. The taste follows suit. Luscious chocolate slathered on top of a lightly roasty glass of sweet stout. Mild earthy finish leaves more chocolate and some traditional Samuel Smith yeast and water flavors. Light stout graininess lingering giving a dark sweet roll laced with cocoa. A full velvety creaminess that envelopes the mouth has you sipping and savoring and back again as soon as you can bear. It goes too fast, but luckily it's only five percent. if you like Southern Tier Choklat but wish for a more sessionable brew your ship has come in.

You can tell its organic just by smelling and tasting it, none of that artificial flavoring some breweries are guilty of. This is definitely a beer I'd recommend to people who dont even like beer. In fact, my brother who isnt in to beer but takes sips of mine, tasted this and immediately said its his favorite beer to date. Its the perfect dessert beer, and imagine it going perfectly with chocolate truffels or something. This is what i will judge all chocolate beers by from now on.","Bone53","Beers"
