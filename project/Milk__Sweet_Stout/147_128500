The flavors are diverse, with the most noticeable being the slightly bitter coffee rounded out by the sweat and creamy chocolate. Notes of spices remind me of drinking Mexican hot chocolate.

4.56,5.1,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Poured from 22 Oz into snifter. Quite a nice find for my little western PA bottle shop. Midnight black with little to no head. Some slick, transient lacing. A beauty. Lots of pepper/green pepper on the nose, with some nice cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa... ridiculous. If they said it was there, it was. The spices were prominent in the taste, an overarching pepper note (sans heat), and some nice chocolate. Velvety mouthfeel, with some of those lovely, lingering spices. Delicious. The reason that I love craft, and a terrific homebrew inspiration.","Mikus","Mar 03, 2015"

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, 1/8th inch, khaki-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets that quickly disperses into a broken sudsy skim.  Some small spots and swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting.  Nose expresses cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and just a hint of chili pepper.  Taste follows nose with  a hint of oxidation and more baker's chocolate than cocoa.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation that, coupled with the chili peppers, leaves a mild, residual burn at the back of the throat.  Overall, a decent beer but I don't understand the hype on this one.","Jwale73","Feb 22, 2015"

Dazzling aroma of coffee,chili peppers,and chocolate.  The flavor is packed with coffee,chocolate,cinnamon,and just a hint of chili and vanilla prior to the fade.

4.67,7.6,4,5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Overall, this is an absolutely delightful beer.  SO…MUCH…cinnamon!!  This is true across both the aroma and the flavoring, where it meets, as it does so well, with a white sugar sweetness.  This makes the beer very, very “cinnamon-sugar”.  Otherwise, the quality of the beer is outstanding.  Each advertised flavor is so perfectly represented, with nothing seeming to cheap out, and nothing seeming synthetic or false.  All of this makes the beer disappear so quickly.  In the parts where we purchased this, there was a widespread one-bottle minimum, so we had to split our efforts.  We ended up getting only one bottle on that first day of the release here locally, but as soon as we could, picked up a second, once that wave came through.  Now, after tasting it, we are infinitely glad we did, but simultaneously kind of sad that we didn’t get any other bottles.  Alas, oh well, but perhaps stone will re-release this one as an ultra-anniversary beer, and it will once again humble us in its presence.","TheBrewo","Jan 27, 2015"

A real flavor explosion going on here, but with such a strong flavor it  maintains some smoothness while going to a dry earthiness then ends with a dry finish then some heat lingering afterwards from the peppers.  Nice drinkable beer.  At 8.1% and all that flavor it's still really a beer any stout lover could handle easily.  Another great Stone collaboration.  If this were brewed again I'd definitely get it.

Big, deep, spicy aromas waft out of the glass...cocoa, vanilla bean, cinnamon, nutmeg, dark coffee beans, nuts, chili peppers - pretty much exactly as advertised and well executed.  Flavor opens with a smooth blend of dark cocoa, cinnamon, and nutmeg followed by vanilla and a pleasant fruitiness.  Not particularly spicy, but the chili flavor is there in a supporting role.  This beer is really more about the spices and malty mocha flavors than the heat.  Chocolate pudding, whipped cream, and berries.  Medium-full bodied and sort of fluffy, drying out completely and not allowing it to get too sweet.  Nicely done.","wedge","Dec 01, 2014"

3.79,-12.7,,,,,,"Bottle from trade and shared with the wife. Pours dark brown from the bottle and settles nearly black in the glass with a two finger khaki brown head. Honestly looked on the thin side as it poured. Aroma is big on the chili peppers, cinnamon and nutmeg, with hints of chocolate and vanilla in the background. Don't get a lot of roast or sweetness in the nose though. Flavor is a different story with lots of cinnamon and chocolate, kick of peppers, a hint of vanilla, and lingering nutmeg. Too much vegetal pepper and some metallic notes. Not spicy really, just vegetal flavored. Medium plus bodied, smooth, with medium plus carbonation. As expected from the look, this is on the thinner side for the style. Needs that big sweet depth to stand up to the spices, but is lacking that. Overall this isn't a poor beer, but it's pretty disappointing after having Mexican Cake, Hunahpu, Abraxas, Bomb, and barrel aged variants of all of those. This one really isn't close.","BMMillsy","Nov 27, 2014"

The transition from fall into winter involves the Marzens and Pumpkin Ales giving way to Stouts and Porters and if any beer could bridge that divide, this would certainly be it. The spice reminded me of a Pumpkin Ale without the burn while the body of this beer was clearly a Milk/Sweet Stout that wasn't jacked up on lactose and sugar. If you love beer, get this. It's not the best Stout out there and probably the best seasonal currently on the shelf but it's damn close to being either of those and the most unique brew that you could grab before the winter firmly sets in. A wonderful mesh of flavors could be found here as this easily deserves to be added to Stone's full-time rotation. A subtly fabulous brew that pushes the boundary of what's possible while tasting as familiar as the recurring seasonals that don't quite measure up to this.","JerzDevl2000","Nov 21, 2014"

Aromas of coffee, caramel, and chocolate dominate with the spicy peppers poking through a bit especially as this warms. The nutmeg and cinnamon are subtle but again poke out a bit more as my sample warms. Great Aroma! Rich chocolate and vanilla hit my palette in spades. Coffee and pepper sweep in to cleanse the sweet maltiness. Milk chocolate with spices linger with a sweetness long after the end of every sip. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a creamy silky velvety mouthfeel. Damn there's a lot going on in this beer! Creamy rich flavorful brew, so glad I was able to find some of this!","johnnnniee","Nov 02, 2014"

This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, slightly creamy, a little dry on the finish, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one bottle is the perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very good and to me it was the highlight of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the higher level of bitterness, I wouldn't mind less bitterness with just a little more sweetness, I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes spiced Stouts.  All in all I was happy with this beer and just a little impressed, stone can be pretty hit or miss for me, but this one was pretty close to being a hit.  It's not my favorite stone beer and it's up there with one of my favorites of the style.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, keep up the good and creative work.","StoutHunter","Nov 01, 2014"

The flavor follows suit with cocoa and coffee notes giving away to a spicy cinnamon aftertaste reminding me of cinnamon mocha coffee.  Alcohol is well disguised by all the flavors.  Full bodied, well carbonated ale that is a bit chewy.  Overall, this is a unique, fresh take on a coffee stout I can recommend this.","Stinkypuss","Nov 01, 2014"

Aroma is of spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, some pepper.  This was my first spiced stout, so to me the taste was really unique.  Very much like a Mexican chocolate - milk chocolate with cinnamon and nutmeg, but with the added complexity of vanilla and peppers.  Nothing over the top... this has very well balanced flavors.  Mouthfeel is really nice, not super heavy or syrupy.  Goes down smooth and doesn't need to be sipped.  Overall, this is a really great beer.

Thick and creamy in the mouth.  Taste ask the above with just a hint of spicy pepper.  Very enjoyable.  Goes down smooth. Not a really high ABV so nothing to mask or hide.

Vanilla, cocoa, coffee and dark malts all blend nicely as well as the cinnamon, pepper, and mild nutmeg all come together nicely and even blend well with the other flavors. Booze is hidden fairly well behind the flavors and heat from the pepper and cinnamon. Quite enjoyable.","jlindros","Oct 19, 2014"

The balance of flavors and the showcase of the adjuncts is great, quite a bit of depth as well, I love how the spices are the forefront rather than the pepper, but it just needs that extra bit of body to carry it to true greatness.","kevanb","Oct 19, 2014"

4.2,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/29/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, cream, chile pepper, nuttiness, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and lactose/spice notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, cream, chile pepper, nuttiness, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Light roast/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, cream, nuttiness, chile pepper, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and lactose/spice flavors; with a pretty much perfect malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome spiced milk stout. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and lactose/spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 16, 2014"

4.5,3.7,,,,,,"Poured a deep, rich black body with slight brown highlights when held to light and a one finger tan head. Appearance is quite nice, very well done for a stout. Scents of coffee, dark coffee grounds, roast malt, cocoa and bittersweet chocolate and vegetal, spicy pepper aromas up front. Cinnamon, cream and hints of vanilla and nutmeg mingle in the background. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich coffee stout that has an interesting pepper presence from the chilies and a nice spiciness from the cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavor begins modestly sweet, like sweetened coffee with cream. Balancing this is a vegetal chili flavor with just a touch of heat, not enough to impart but the slightest heat and a bit of a dark coffee flavor and a light cinnamon presence. A bit of chocolate, vanilla and cocoa are discernible in the background, though not heavily. The middle moves into a more dark coffee flavor, with notes of rich semi-sweet chocolate, a slight pepper that takes on a mild burning character and a bit of a cinnamon flavor. Finish is semi-sweet with notes of semi-sweet chocolate, cocoa powder, dark coffee grounds, coffee with cream, vegetal, spicy chili, hints of cinnamon, a light touch of alcohol and a mildly spicy chili and cinnamon swallow. Aftertaste is spicy and dark with notes of cinnamon, chili, cocoa, dark coffee grounds and roast malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very complex milk stout that has a variety of very good flavors mingling together into a wonderful cohesive whole that has the aimed-for character of traditional hot chocolate. It is rich and deep, spicy, yet semi-sweet and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation, a creamy feel and a slight burn from the chili and cinnamon. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderfully rich and full stout with a nice burn from the added ingredients that is warming and pleasant. Overall this is a very good experimental stout. It has a nice milk stout base, that is aided by the addition of chili, cinnamon, cocoa and coffee in both aroma and flavor. Its mouthfeel aids drinkability and is warming and nice. The only downside is the general lack of vanilla and especially nutmeg, two of the ingredients, in the aroma and especially in the flavor. A very good stout nonetheless and well worth trying.","Auraan","Oct 11, 2014"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, peppers, bittersweet chocolate, cinnamon, and some vanilla.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some nutmeg and vegetal pepper flavors.  The peppers seem spicer in the aroma, there isn't much pepper heat in the taste of this beer at all.  Maybe I guess I was just expecting it to be spicier.  With that being said, I still think it's a pretty tasty brew!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and creamy with a good amount of carbonation.  I liked this a lot, especially the coffee/mocha/chocolate flavor.  Stone and the other collaborators hit a home run with this, hopefully Stone will decide to bring it back at some point.  $9.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Oct 10, 2014"

It was like a pumpkin stout with no pumpkin. The heat was there but not terrible. To be honest I don't like spicy foods and this was fine. Your mouth gets used to it very quickly and it dissappears into the mix quite nicely. I couldn't tell how much I liked it and then I looked down and it was gone. It would be an occasional sipper not a daily drinker though. Glad I got to try and looking forward to trying others of the style to compare","Flight317","Oct 08, 2014"

Nutmeg, hot chocolate and vanilla. A very interesting mix of flavors. Finishes with more cinnamon and some very light heat from the chile peppers. I'm surprised the abv is 8.1%.

I'll try again at a later date by itself for a more honest andd fair review. It ain't easy to follow Ten Fidy.....","Hophazzard","Oct 03, 2014"

I'm obviously predisposed to like it, given the style and ingredients, but I still think they have executed it quite well. They've managed to capture my favorite parts of the big Mexican stouts, while making it unique enough that it's not just a knockoff of other beers. I know it's not often that Stone decides to redux a collaboration beer, but I'm really hopeful that they will decide to produce this one regularly. Even if not, I have made sure to stock up on bottles--an easy thing to do at such a reasonable price with such wide availability.","LambicPentameter","Sep 30, 2014"

Flavor was a bit like spicy pumpkin pie, spice with a hit of heat in the back.  Small bit of lactose sweet as well.  Coated very well, nice and thick with just a bit of carbonation.

Definitely a lighter imperial stout, not one you'd have trouble drinking a whole bomber of. Love the vanilla, cinnamon, and cocoa powder flavors in it. Could use with a bit less pepper astringency but it's not a big distractor at all. Heck it may actually even help round out the beer and keep it from feeling thin, but I wouldn't know unless I had the same beer without the peppers.

This style - Mexican hot-chocolate/coffee - has become increasingly popular in recent times, with a number of breweries exploring this flavor combination. What Stone has created is an absolute beauty of a coffee/hot chocolate/cinnamon/pepper stout.  Without a question this is the best beer from Stone that I've tried and easily deserving of a place in the list of my the top 5 stouts. I can only hope that they decide to bring this back on a regular basis, as it would regularly find its way into my refrigerator.  At $8.99/22oz, this surely has to be a more economical and equally delicious alternative to the likes of a number of hard-to-find, brewery-only Mexican-hot-chocolate-style stouts.  If you can find a bottle or two, go for it - I only hope I can get my hands on a couple more.","Buschyfor3","Sep 27, 2014"

The flavor is less dynamic but I actually prefer its more rounded flavors. I'm happy the peppery heat isn't as intense. It's got some excellent mocha and coffee and chocolate. The cinnamon is as soft as the pepper. Vanilla is also detectable. Body matches the octane pretty well. Medium to soft carbonation. Far more drinkable than I was expecting.

Beautiful.  The aromas are toasty and cinnamon forward, with subtle chocolate and mocha coffee in the background.  It almost smells like a chai latte.  Nice. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a blast of coffee and dark chocolate, as well as a healthy dose of cinnamon.  Some pepper heat slips in the background, not to overpower, but to enhance everything.  Vanilla highlights help round everything out, too.  Pretty layered and rich palate.  The chocolate and subtle heat join the cinnamon spice in the aftertaste.  This smooth, slightly dry brew provides a smooth, almost creamy finish, with a cinnamon and roast linger. Some of that coffee bitter lingers, too. Great beer!","GarthDanielson","Sep 26, 2014"

4.45,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black, appearing opaque in the glass, with a half finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Very aromatic, dominated by Mexican chocolate (with the cinnamon typical of this style of chocolate), coffee, sweet dark malt; spicy and appealing. Flavor is sweet dark malt, lactose, light Mexican chocolate and coffee, pie spices, lightly nutty. Nice medium creamy body. Amazingly well balanced, with the spices and milk stout components complimenting each other perfectly and a nice note of coffee in the background. This could have easily been dominated by any of the strong flavors, but everything is in harmony. ABV well covered; this could be a rich chocolate infused horchata. Recommended.","LiquidAmber","Sep 22, 2014"

Overall a wonderful coffee and cocoa stout with nice blend of pepper with cinnamon and a very enjoyable base stout to make a beer that is better than individual interests combined it really works as a blend of spices integrated -exceptional!","Slatetank","Sep 22, 2014"

I realize that it is lower in ABV, and I appreciate that more often these days, but it just doesn't seem to fit with the great flavor profile. Don't get me wrong. This is still an outstanding beer, at a great price too ($6). Since taste is still the most important part, I gave it a 4.25 overall. Easily my second favorite chili pepper beer.

Slight roast bitter at the end. This would be an amazing Christmas-time drink, kind of strange that Stone is releasing it when it's so hot outside. Nonetheless, solid milk stout with a lot of character.","jibbyvonjibb","Sep 14, 2014"

Where this one is drastically different than Mexican cake and hunah in my eyes is in the mouthfeel.  This beer is way lighter and softer.  While it supports the flavors well, I like these flavors to be in a chewier bigger beer.  More like a cake.  Great beer though.  Get it if you can.","cosmicevan","Sep 14, 2014"

There are just way too many flavors battling here and while it's a better effort than a lot of these collaboration beers ultimately kind of a miss.

The flavor falls a bit flat unfortunately; way thinner than expected. I get the coffee up front and the cinnamon lingers in the finish but I was hoping for something a bit more rich and complex. Almost no pepper or vanilla flavor. The body is also lighter than expected, which helps drinkability but kind of takes away from the experience. I had very high hopes for this and can't help but feel slightly let down. Don't get me wrong; this is a very good beer, especially for the price, but of the similar-style beers I've had this year I'd have to rank them Mexican Cake > Hunahpu > Xocoveza > Bomb!","ltjska04","Sep 10, 2014"
