Smell is bakers chocolate, coffee, vanilla, biscuit, and caramel. Taste is all of that, but chocolate dominates and isn't that aggressive, still a nice milf flavor. Body is on the thin side for a stout, nice amount of life, mildly dry, and extremely drinkable. This far from earth shattering, but it is a pleasant almost session able stout.","SawDog505","Dec 29, 2013"
3.4,-9.3,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown and clear with faint edges and a fine tan cap. Thin head that stuck around for a while and left some spots on the glass. Roasty aroma, coffee and cocoa, kind of like chocolate cake. Sweet lactose up front, cocoa and semisweet chocolate, slight hop character with mild to moderate bitterness mostly in the finish. Medium plus body with medium to low carbonation, a bit dry with a hint of alcohol, decent texture. Pretty good, but it didn't feel completely melded together. I'd hesitate to let it sit though, for fear of losing some of the rich character.","DrJay","Dec 19, 2013"

The initial smell was nice, dark malt with a little bit of coffee, but as it warmed up I started to notice a little sourness. The sourness definitely came through in the taste also. I think I must have gotten a slightly infected bottle, unfortunately. It seems like it would have been a pretty nice stout otherwise. I didn't really notice any chocolate, but that could have been related to the infection. I look forward to re-reviewing this beer if I find a good bottle.","jtladner","Aug 28, 2013"

The nose is rich and powerful: milk chocolate,cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malt, nice. More approachable than expected. The flavor is more of the same. Likely the richest beer I've ever had! The roast and chocolate blend terrifically with a gentle sweetness and mild bitterness. Creamy and smooth the beer finishes with a lingering milk chocolate flavor. Wee carbonated, very nice. Overall, this is a serious treat! Very enjoyable!","hopfacebrew","Apr 06, 2012"

Its a relief to see them take on a style they were albeit willing to conform to their standards. That is to say, the brewery is probably not going to be launching a "big beer" series anytime soon, so it's nice to see their offering for this uniquely Americanized style done well.","Gambrinus1184","Beers"

Taste is medium bodied, smacks you with chocolate malts upfront, nice hoppiness on the back end. Super smooth and drinkable. Not too sure about the truffle part.. but one of the better chocolate stouts I've had, solid beer.","oriolesfan4","0"

One of the better beers coming out of Connecticut.","tigg924","Mar 19, 2012"

3.48,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"After a somewhat aggressive pour this beer turns out very dark brown, just a shade lighter than black, with a light khaki head of about one finger. The foam falls to a thin layer of bubbles with a bit of lace on the sides of the glass. As the name suggests chocolate is in the smell but it isn't alone as there is also a standard compliment of dark and roasted malts typical of a dry stout but overall everything is a bit subdued. The taste is a bit of chocolate both from the added chocolate and chocolate malts along with a good deal of bitter roasted and black patent malt. Hop flavor is nearly non existent but it is still somewhat bitter to astringent due to the malt. The body of this beer is quite light which surprises me for a stout of this style, I'd expect something a bit fuller. The finish is slightly bitter and rather dry as astringent bittering from the roasted malt comes through, again I'd rather something a bit sweeter for this stout. Overall this is slightly above average. It is an interesting concept but suffers because the stout isn't right too best accentuate the chocolate. A sweeter, fuller and more complex (maybe higher alcohol?) base would have benefited this one.","fank2788","Mar 10, 2012"

I find it funny now to be drinking a beer made with chocolate from this family-owned, Connecticut-based company. All in all, a nicely done stout. Hopefully this is only the start of Hooker Brewing's attempt to add some long needed diversity to their current lineup of beers.","Damian","Mar 08, 2012"

3.93,4.8,4.5,4,4,3,4,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped: 2012-02-09. Sampled on March 6, 2012. It pours a very dark, rich chocolate black with a moderate, short-lived mocha head. Brewed with seven malts you get the chocolate, oat, and dark malts right up front on the nose with this acidic hop bite around the back. The body was thin the medium, which was a slight letdown. The bold flavor begins with sweet chocolate and cocoa then goes bitter and ends nearly dry. Its name sounded much more enticing than the experience but it was still a decent enough beer.","puboflyons","Mar 05, 2012"
3.96,5.6,3,4.5,4,3,4,"12oz bottle with a Born On Date of 2012-02-15. Pours a blackish dark brown with no head. No lacing. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate truffles, and some coffee. Tastes chocolatey. Flavors of vanilla, coffee, some marshmallow, and truffle. Mouthfeel is a bit light and thin for the style but it still works. This is an easy drinking stout that isn't so chocolatey it slows you down. Overall, an interesting collaboration well executed. Worth seeking out.","PicoPapa","Feb 29, 2012"
