4.5,23,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods. Pours very dark brown with a billowing head of khaki froth. Aroma of dark chocolate, ground coffee beans and roasted malt. The taste features a black coffee roasted bitterness, though a little warming helps balance things out. Hops are earthy and meld fairly seamlessly with the bitterness of the roast. The mouth feel is thin which helps, along with the lactose, to moderate the bold bitterness. Great balance. Light and tasty is a rare combination that deserves extra points. Love the low ABV.","loubar","Mar 19, 2015"
3.3,-9.8,4,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"This one is an easy drinking sweet stout from Stone that had a good balance and went down easy enough but ultimately failed to excite, it was quite an average beer for me really and not one I'd be likely to go back to again. While it definitely wasn't a bad one from the brewery, it never really hit the heights of Young's Double Chocolate Stout or even Left Hand's Milk Stout but it was nice enough I guess.","flyingpig","Mar 18, 2015"

3.11,-15,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Bittersweet. Surprisingly mild coffee flavor, though that's still the dominant note. Not cloying but definite sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, though not as "thick" as I usually expect from a stout.","founddrama","Mar 17, 2015"
