3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  Aroma of spices and roasted malt.  The flavor is a mix of roasted malt with a coffee like essence and a bit of ginger and cinnamon.  Clove and spices round out the aroma.  The taste is roasted with a yam like vegetable flavor but ample roast as it warms. Vanilla and cinnamon, roasted malt, slight bitterness.  Full bodied and smooth.  Pretty decent.","Stinkypuss","Mar 22, 2015"

4.04,9.2,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Appearance is a black liquid with a foamy, sudsy light brown head.  The smell is just like gingerbread cookies...spicy ginger and sugar, backed with a little malt and alcohol.  The taste is sweet, but not cloying...a firm malt structure and lots of spice and ginger.  I a usually dubious of spicy gimmick holiday brews.  This one, however, is well made and a real treat.  Enjoyable and flavorful.","Suds","Feb 09, 2015"
