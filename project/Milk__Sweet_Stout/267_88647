4.57,12,5,4.25,4.5,5,4.75,"This is a solid chocolate milk stout. It's not as exciting as I thought it would be but it was still extremely satisfying. Odell is a solid brewery and this is a solid brew. It's really smooth and not overly carbonated. Great mouthfeel, and thought its strong for a stout (8.5%) it's not overpowering. In fact, there wasn't a the alcohol bite you normally get from an 8.5% beer. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a stout that won't disappoint you.","Grant_Satterthwaite","Mar 20, 2015"
