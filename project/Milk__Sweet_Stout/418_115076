It worked really well and looked like it was poured from a tap.  The "volcano" effect settled into a sweet smelling odor of chocolate and roasted coffee.  The taste was as smooth as silk!  It tasted like a milkshake, at times it was hard to remember this was a beer.  The smooth silky flavors coat your mouth and leave a nice feeling and leaving you wanting more.  This is a very nice beer with a sweetness to it.  I suggest pairing this with a desert or after a meal as a desert.  It was really a quality beer.","JPowell712","Mar 27, 2015"

I am usually harsh on stouts because most have added carbonation and I personally feel that stouts are better on their natural, creamy froth like this one. A: black as coffee, and not to thick. Hardly a fingers worth of head that dissipates to a quarter finger that lasts throughout with minimal lacing. S: definitely milky, hints of mocha and chocolate, undertones of bread. and absolutely no hint of hops. T: milk and mocha are strong, chocolate and bread come later, slight dark fruit, hops are completely disguised. F: smooth, milky, and very little carbonation. Have to be careful because of how smooth it is, it goes down quick. O: superb stout. Definitely on my favorite list. It's actually refreshing.","mschipper","Mar 21, 2015"

Thankfully, all of the inverted Glugs as a part of The CANQuest (tm) left me well-versed in how to pull this off. First, the cascade as the N2 was driven off led to the creation of a finger of dense, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) with cola highlights visible only at the edges. Nose was very chocolaty with a touch of underlying smoke. Mouthfeel was big, full and creamy. The taste was really chocolaty, extremely sweet, especially for this hophead and the combination put me in mind of chocolate pudding or chocolate mousse. Wow! Finish was likewise quite sweet and intensely chocolaty. I would definitely have this as a dessert beer, if I was ever asked about a dessert beer.","woodychandler","Mar 15, 2015"

Like most nitro beers, the nose is non existent and all flavors are muted. Nice creamy mouthfeel.

4.78,14.9,5,4.5,4.75,5,5,"Best By 05/28/2015.  Vertical bottle pour into a stout glass as directed by Left Hand Brewery.  Pour reveals cascades of beautiful purging nitrogen from bottom to top.  Head eventually grows to two fingers - it is quite dense and creamy looking and light khaki in color.  Light on the nose: Roasted malts, coffee bean, then chocolate milk.  Mouth feel is sort of light as soon as it enters the mouth, but the agitation of the nitrogen creates the illusion of a full bodied and very creamy stout.  I Could session this all day long at 6% ABV.  Taste is like the smell but more pronounced - roasted malts, chocolate milk, then light coffee bean/slight hop bitterness lingers for a little while.  Overall I'm very impressed, and I like the Nitro Milk Stout better than Left Hand's regular Milk Stout because it's so pretty to look at and it tastes creamier yet less filling.","nizzle8287","Jan 28, 2015"

Little to no sugar smell.  Taste is like a more fill bodied Guinness.  Not sweet. Not boozy.  No overpowering coffee taste.  Too light in the mouth and taste for me.  Very light abv so you can drink a few.  Not a lot of taste actually.  I was disappointed but I prefer boozy bourbon barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout.  This is too light for me.  Might be your cup of tea though.","uvachief","Jan 05, 2015"

The mouthfeel is where it goes a bit wrong for me.  I know it's only a 6% abv beer but I was expecting just a bit more because it's a milk/sweet stout.  Taste is pretty typical for a milk stout but nothing too special.

Smells are good with chocolate and coffee and a little mocha.  But it falls short on flavor and mouth feel.  Flavors are good, but mild.  Too subtle to rate as an exceptional stout.  A little chocolate, very little coffee, no roast, no hops, little malt sweetness. The flavors that are there are good, but they are not assertive enough for my taste.  Mouth feel is watery for a milk stout.  Very thin, light to medium body.  Frothy foam is correct for milk, but this is more like skim milk than a chocolate milk shake.  So although I thought it was OK, it just wasn't anything special.","DougT","0"

Even if I'm not crazy about a beer, I will almost always finish it. In this rare case, I had to dump it. I thought that perhaps this was the first time I had ever dumped a beer. Then, I recalled that I had once ordered this milk sout, months ago, at a beer. I am belatedly reviewing this beer as I recall the only other time I was unable to finish one. The milky taste and low carbonation was too much of a turn off. Not for me.","Gajo74","Nov 17, 2014"

4.25,2.2,,,,,,"So is this a nitrogenated beer simply bottled? It seems to be, and it really brings out the character of the beer. I've had the Left Hand milk stout in the regular version before, but this really blows me away. It made me think of Mackeson's XXX, which for me was the original, as well as the be all and end all of milk stouts, and then it lived up to that, and perhaps even surpassed it in a way as it's so clean and focused. Is there a little more character to the Mackeson's? Or is it just the nitro that's making me think the Left Hand is more homogenized? Regardless, I am crazy in love with this beer. Even for people who "don't really like dark beer", this is an absolute must-try!!!","NeroFiddled","Oct 23, 2014"

The flavors are light yet balanced with roasted malts, chocolate, lactose, and oats. This is like an edmund fitzgerald with lactose thrown in. Its so damn creamy i dont even feel it going down. This is what i wished Guinness could be. A perfect go to or for someone new to stouts. I regularly indulge in RISs and still find this great.

Great looking beer and one that definitely promotes the "chocolate milk" type of effect in a beer, but still having the bitter finish of a stout and you know its a beer.  Went very well with dark chocolate chip wheat muffins, and I think it would go well with other desserts.  I'll have to revisit this beer again someday.","damndirtyape","Sep 30, 2014"

Taste and feel are equally highly ranked; smooth, sweeter and roasty with almost zero detectable hops. So velvety smooth and with enough body.

I remember just how taken I was with the lacing the first time.  Each sip is measured for posterity along the glass down to the last gulp. Chocolate and something like a warm pumpernickel rye greet the nose.  The even smoothness of the creamy stout gives way to an initial subtle sweet latte flavor settling into a dark chocolate finish. I cannot remember which of my many preferred stouts was my favorite prior to my first LH-MS-N.  My next favorite will need to be pretty immaculate to force me away from this 'dairy queen.' I think you could drink this with a peanut butter and jelly, but on it's own this is a great after school/work snack!","StoutdeSuite","Beers"

There's a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, and some coffee.  I think the taste is the same as the aroma, it's all roasted malt, milk/bittersweet chocolate and coffee.  The mouthfeel is medium, it's really creamy and smooth.  Very easy to drink with moderate carbonation.  I think it's a little bit better than their original Milk Stout because of the improved mouthfeel on this.  It's a good brew, I wouldn't turn down one!  $2.19 for a single bottle.","bluejacket74","Aug 28, 2014"

Probably just me not pouring it hard enough into the glass, but there was little to no head, which I found disappointing. Smell: Wonderful. Notes of milk and mocha/espresso. Taste/mouthfeel: Exceptional. I personally love milk stouts, and this reminded me of my all-time favorite beer, Odell Lugene. Very smooth taste with strong coffee notes. In general, the taste is lacking a bit for me, I found myself wanting more flavor than I got. The aftertaste is quite pleasant; I could easily drink this beer all night long with no problem. Occasionally, I taste a sharp alcohol note (usually upon the initial sip), but it disappears quickly. Overall, a wonderful milk stout that I will purchase again.","sheeley","Aug 05, 2014"

There's lots of coffee and chocolate in the nose. Taste is nice - sweet smooth malt with tons of coffee flavor and some chocolate, just a hint of roast, but nothing brisk or sharp at all. Mouthfeel is smooth with low carbonation and a chocolate milk-like texture. This is overall a good after dinner dessert beer that would also stand up fairly well on it's own.","FFreak","Jul 20, 2014"

If you enjoy Guinness, this will blow your mind.  The "Nitro" truly does improve overall texture and mouthfeel.  Left Hand does make  carbonated milk stout  which is good but doesn't compare to their Nitro version.  Highly recommend.","Mac","Jun 16, 2014"

4.38,5.3,5,3.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Pours a jet black looking black color into a 16-oz Guinness glass. Cascading tan head that forms. Great lacing on the glass sides. Smells a tad roasts with mocha highlights. Some vanilla & chocolate. Tastes sweet from the lactose with chocolate & vanilla undertones. Decent bitterness evens things out. Hops seem earthy & woodsy although mostly nonexistent. Feels silky smooth from nitro. Like a milkshake. Great feel - medium full to full. Overall, a very well crafted beer. Nitro makes it extra so special.","jwhancher","May 25, 2014"

4.27,2.6,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a gorgeous deep black with a two finger tan head that stuck around and left abundant lacing. Nice nitro cascade and bubbles throughout. Very good looking stout. Scents of milk chocolate, roast malt, cocoa and slight black coffee. A very nice aroma, quite chocolate-forward and sweet, but with the darker stout aromas present as well. Very nice. Flavor begins with sweet milk chocolate, mingled with roast malt and bitter-sweet cocoa flavors, moving into a more pronounced hit of roast malt, with some cream and black coffee. Finish is dry, with flavors of bitter-sweet cocoa, roast malt and cream. Aftertaste is bitter roast malt and cocoa powder. A very nice flavor, rich and creamy with big hits of chocolate, yet balanced by roasted and bitter flavors nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a modest prickly carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink, quite nice. Overall this is a great milk stout. It's not too sweet, not too bitter, finding a nice balance in-between. It has a rich aroma and great mouthfeel that aid its very good flavor profile. Very well done.","Auraan","Apr 15, 2014"
