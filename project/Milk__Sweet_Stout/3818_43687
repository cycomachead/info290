They really hit the mark on what they were trying to accomplish, but it's definitely a novelty type beer that I probably won't go for again.  With all the candy and chocolate his Easter morning, I was compelled to finally open this and satisfy my curiosity.","hopflyer","Saturday at 02:20 AM"

But there's no way I am going to be able to drink much more than a shot glass at one sitting.","DoubleMalt","Saturday at 01:42 AM"

Also if you don't like a sweet note in your beer then this would be one to avoid.","GTJayG","Thursday at 10:52 PM"

3.66,-6.2,4.25,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Again I find milk stouts too rich for me.  It seems like there is a protein element present that is off putting.  This one looks great and the body is nice and thick.  The nose is strong butterscotch which would be quite nice if it were toned down a bit.  It's just too sweet and strong.  The taste is similarly overloaded to the point that I finds self just trying to get it down instead of spending any time with it.  I don't want to knock it too much since others seem to be high on it, just coming to the conclusion that this family is not for me.","Foxybrau","Apr 01, 2015"
