4.07,1.5,4.25,4,4,4,4.25,"EBF sample pour. Pours dark brown. Smell is goddamn chocolate milk. Nails it's intended purpose. Milk chocolate with some coffee and cream. Flavor is the same. A glass of chocolate milk with a strong of chocolate syrup. Some softer coffee flavors. Coffee with a lot of cream. Lactose. Body is light but the feel is creamy. Executed very well here. 4 Hands has quickly become a brewery that caught my attention. Good job again.","VelvetExtract","Mar 19, 2015"
