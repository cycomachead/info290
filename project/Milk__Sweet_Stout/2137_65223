4.23,9.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"This beer is one of Breckenridge's better offerings.  It's basically a milkshake with alcohol.  You definitely taste the cream and the chocolate up front, and it's pretty smooth too.  Seems like they do their best work with the darker beers, as I'm also a fan of the Vanilla Porter and the Oatmeal Stout.  This is a small-batch offering sold in 4-packs, so if you find it, pick some up if you like this style.","dcscientist","Mar 11, 2015"

4.03,4.4,4,4,4,4.25,4,"3/3...pours very dark black, light ring of tan foam. Dark chocolate nose, espresso coffee too. Hearty creamy taste, bold coffee bitter swirls into creamy milky smoothness. Not unlike chocolate milk. Beyond smooth, loaded with flavor.","KTCamm","Mar 07, 2015"
4.52,17.1,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Brew pours pretty close to a pitch black in color with just a hint of ruby-highlights near the top. Close to a 1-finger foamy beige head is seen. A good amount of ring-lacing is seen after each sip. The aroma is very nice and is of sweet chocolate and dark roasted malts for the most part. Bit more going on with the taste with some milk, sugar as well as a light hint of coffee in the mix also. Very smooth with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation which most milk stouts have. Really tasty and would drink this again!","BeerWithMike","Mar 05, 2015"
