3.81,6.4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a thin, almost black coloring with no head. Aromas of roasted coffee, hints of cream, caramel, and toffee sweetness. Decently balanced aromas, with hints of smoke in there, too. Flavors are roasted forward, with a sweet blend of cream and caramel to follow. The backbone is bitter roasted coffee, supporting all the sweetness and making this a layered experience on the palate. Fairly smooth, light, dry bodied, with a sweet cream and caramel-chocolate mocha aftertaste. The finish has a subtle lactose linger on a dry feel. Not bad.","GarthDanielson","Sunday at 02:57 PM"
