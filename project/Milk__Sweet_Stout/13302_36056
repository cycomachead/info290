I can't remember another stout that's gone down so easy. Great beer. Would buy again.","blindhoedeath","Feb 06, 2015"

3.6,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pours dark brown with light head and little lacing. Smells of toffy and malt. Light on the tongue, but decent roasted flavors linger with no discernable alcohol. Very tasty!","tekstr1der",
