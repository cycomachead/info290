3.76,-9.4,4.5,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Had it on tap at the brewery. Looked straight black and smell had hints of coffee. Taste was smooth and sweet, made me think créme brûlée. Honestly, was a little too sweet for my liking and not as thick as I would normally like a stout this alcoholic to be. Still a really good beer overall, but not one I'll be hunting down.","Chris_the_Tartar","Feb 15, 2015"
