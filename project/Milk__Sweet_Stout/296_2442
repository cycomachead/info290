AROMA: intense, lactic, almost pungent impact with charcoal, peat and chocolate--a swirl of stoutly aromas... PALATE: mildly smooth; a bit oily and liquidy; active and medium-bodied; a bit soda-esque, but not as creamy as hoped for...TASTE: vanilla and milk mix playfully on the tongue; peaty and a bit smoky too--more complex than expected...

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight char aromas. There is also a bit of a soy sauce aroma that comes out as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with bittersweet cocoa and char flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

3.53,-8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours nearly black with ruby highlights and a sparse, khaki colored head. Aroma is mild and roasty with a hint of chocolate and alcohol. Roasted malt dominates the flavor profile, but the character is not particularly like coffee or chocolate--just a general roasted flavor. Lactose comes through a bit in the finish and moreso as the beer warms. Some alcoholic warmth is also noticeable, but it's not especially strong. Hop flavor is fairly mild, just enough to lend some balance. Carbonation feels a shade higher than necessary for the style, and the body could be a little fuller. With that said, this remains a safe and drinkable English stout.","MaximalC","Dec 26, 2012"

One finger head that quickly faded with minimal lacing. The nose definitely leans more towards sweet than roasty with hints of dark fruit, vanilla, milk chocolate, and caramel with just a touch of banana. The taste is a bit more complex than the nose, but still leaning to the sweet side. Dark chocolate, dark fruits, and coffee dominate along with hints of bubblegum, toffee, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and not as creamy as I was expecting, with a nice subtle bitter, smooth finish. Not really all that familiar with the style, and it was a little too sweet for my liking, but a solid offering nonetheless.","beerdrifter","May 31, 2012"

Iced coffee with a mild hint of carbonation. Good, medium mouthfeel to add to the great smooth taste. Overall- Wow, really a surprise. A very good milk stout with complex flavors and great feel.

2.65,-31.2,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"St. Peters models itself as the classic image of the English brewery, drawing from its locale and surrounding environment to spin together a truly English brew. It's the image Americans seek as they sojourn around the English countryside, hunting for the uber-local beers that distinguish one pub from another. The bottle and label for St. Peters' line of beers adds to this local and Anglo-Saxon flavor, and to be honest, the flavor too. The flavor is sweet and cloying, though without the dark chocolate malts or roasted flavors I typically associated with stouts and their style off-shoots. This is sweet and light, packed with scents of sugary grapes and cough medicine. For those beer drinkers who enjoy well-operated historical events and museums, this tastes like something you'd receive as a sample to illustrate what the original root beer recipe tasted like. I even imagined it tasting like an old-timey panacea, curing all your aches, pains and even stubborn cases of polio. The flavor has a similar taste, with sassafras and the raw herbal quality of a homemade root beer. It's a singular taste, but one I'm unaccustomed to, with a palate and flavor that distinguish this beer as an old-fashioned flavor looking to impact modern palates.","GarrettB","Sep 14, 2011"

Subtle caramel, pumpernickel, bitter dark chocolate and coffee...citrusy notes (?).

Lacing is fine and even and I can't get over these medicine bottles, a bit different then they used to be but still unique. Nose has some dark roasted malt a hint of black licorice an some smoked malt or peat kilned malts going on. Also hints of coffee and creamy dark chocolate come out in the aroma. Flavor brings on some acidity between the dark roasted malts and the addition of the lactose, this beer finishes slighty tart and smokey with again peat smoked malts kicking in. Earthy fruitines and subdued bitterness from the fuggles and challenger hop additions. Very fresh tasting this beer just came in at my local, the sharp acidic notes and fruity undertones really make this an interesting experience. Solid cream stout from across the pond medium bodied for a stout but not nearly as heavy as the bruising American or Russian versions of this style. Mellow carbonation works well with the style, this gets better and better as it warms up. Drinkability overall is great, a nice flavorful and easy to consume stout this one won't weight you down like many big stouts on the market.","WVbeergeek","Jul 30, 2010"

However as the luxurious fruity and somewhat cocoa-flavored liquid oozes over my palate I am eventually left with a mild bitter, almost tart, and definitely drying finish, that somehow balances the sweetness and keeps the beer well short of cloying. If there is diacetyl I am not able to identify it as such. If I am quibbling, it is to say that the beer could have more dark/chocolate/roast - stereotypical "stout" character, as the fruitiness is pretty dominant. The carbonation is soft, the body medium or higher but never overly filling, and it is creamier than many big stouts. Really, really well done.","udubdawg","Jun 04, 2010"

Nice balance of flavor mixing the earthy/roasted bitterness and the sweetness. Also enjoyable to have the chocolate taste go from dark toward milk chocolate during the taste.

The disappointment began with very unimpressive foamy head in that there was very little of it. The smell of the beer reminded me of the smell of rubber dirty car tires. The taste overall was drinkable but very unimpressive, nothing creamy about it in fact. From the start this beer is considerably over-carbonated, however, at the end when the carbonation was significantly less which revealed a flavors that I can only describe as sub-par and actually quite unpleasant.

Definate hop bitterness is noted as well as some alcohol warmth. The body is not that substantial. I would say on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is low so the beer has a soft texture. Lacks the body to give a good creamy stout feel. This is a wonderful stout that packs some serious English hop action.

A great aroma of rich brown sugar, roasted malts, hops, some fruit, and some smoky/meaty flavors too. The flavor is top notch; initial sweet chocolate and brown sugar flavors followed by a nice smooth fruitiness. Throughout the roasted malt flavors are dominant.

A very rich and sweet malty backbone underneath layers of faint cream, chocolate, and toffee and then a little bit of burnt malt in there as well.

Nice jet-black, ebony appearance with a reddish-tan, frothy head... smell, as expected, contained the usual stout-like elements of cocoa notes and latte, but the flavor was average to say the least - taste didn't complement the aroma as I was anticipating... rather bland and watery and dull without too much flavor or that typical creamy, lactose, sugar-sweet flavor... "watered-down" is the best way I can describe it... not too much to brag about here... mouthfeel was decent and drinkability wasn't bad due to the rather modest 6.5% ABV, although I certainly wouldn't make this my session beer for the evening... not bad, worth a try, but I wouldn't break my back seeking this one out...","dsa7783","Feb 02, 2008"

Taste is a bit better than average, and entirely in character for, what you'd expect with this style. Mouthfeel is actually a bit on the thin side.

It sure does look good, from the throw-back vintage bottle look to the dark licorice-black color with its big light brown head and substantial lacing. The smell also suggests licorice along with some chocolate and brown sugar. I find it quite true to its name upon first sampling. Although a little "lighter" than I expected, it had a frothy, creamy feel full of sugary licorice and brown sugar. The taste matches the aroma in my book and its pretty good. But I do find this one a bit too sweet and I don't pick up the malt quality I would like. About half through this mugfull I opted for some mild cheddar cheese and it really brought this beer around, and made the cheese taste better than usual, as well! There is a decided smoke finish that becomes more prominent as you go. I like it but I'm not sure that the cheese might be a necessary accessory. Like most all St. Peters stuff, worth a try and I will be happy to do the Cream Stout & cheese extravaganza again any time.","Durge","Sep 06, 2007"

The actual taste was another story- flavors were weak and extremely unappetizing. The malts were not present, snor was there any sweet creaminess, or body to speak of- the body was surpisingly light and watered down. The flavor of burnt chocolate permeated the entire beer from beginning to end- the only departure was a bitter hop splash at the end which could not save this harsh stout.

There's a bit of spotty lacing. Roasty aroma with sweet caramel and milk chocolate notes, plus a subtle smokiness. Mild bitterness from hops, but there is some from the dark grain as well. Roasted malts dominate, giving it some chocolate and burnt character. I think there's a bit of smoke in the finish too, which is definitely a little acidic with a mild nuttiness.

The flavor isn't as creamy as many other cream stouts either. It's a rather mildly flavored stout with the bitter roasted malt flavor smoothed over by the cream. Something of a mix between a traditional stout and what one might think of as a traditional cream stout. Not the best example of the style, but at least pleasant enough.

Again, nice chocolate and light coffee to start, moving to a more coffee like finish with a moderate blast of lactic bite and a modest bitter finish. The lactic charater really comes through on the aftertaste. Feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. The beer feels almost velvety smooth. Drinkability is very nice as well.

Flavor is very quaffable; chocolate and coffee dominate, with some malt afterthoughts and mild hints of herbs. Mouthfeel is near perfect.

In the swallow and aftertaste, the roasted malt takes center stage and the burnt aspect imparts a nice bitterness that's a welcome change from the sweet beginning.

As it settles, a small, tan head forms and then quickly dissipates, leaving you with a glassful of motor oil. It gets a 4.0 not for being good, but for being intimidating. Here goes. Smells lactose-sweet and roasted/burnt, pretty much exactly like Sam Adam's version of a cream stout. Taste has some upfront sweetness and some coffee--very acrid, burnt coffee--but also an alarming amount of phenol. More like St. Peter's Band-Aid Stout.

Almost smoky. Awesome. In the front, there is more rich chocolate toffee, followed by a tangy, fruity, buttery, oily, flattish middle (which is not to say I don't love it).

The taste is totally original: almost tastes like coffee, and has the same thick consistency as a warm cup.

However described - its awesome. Seems to finish so dry it should not be called a sweet stout. My 500 ml. "flask" bottle definately contained the right stuff!

It really brought out the espresso & chocolate notes in the cigar). This may be a bit expensive, but I think itÂs one of the rare authentic versions of this beer style around. There are a few American versions, but with Mackesons being made in the USA now and a shadow of itself, this is a nice substitute.","Dantes","Jul 27, 2004"

Easily tossed back into the gullet, but retains a wicked, dark character that rides through the finish. Actually, I look into rescinding my words as it gets silkier and smoother with each subsequent sip, still brimming with dark, chocolatey, coffeeish flavors. Very nice, even very, VERY nice.

Maybe I am yet to learn the subtleties of a good cream stout but this concoction had me giving up beer for a week just to let my poor pallet recover and to let the blackness fade from me tongue. I paid 2.89 for a pint bottle of this beverage and I feel as if they may have fleeced the poor old country boy.","Roderick","Jul 20, 2004"

Pours out black with a tannish head that goes away quickly. Carbonation is still seen around the out edges of the glass. Smell consisted of all sorts of things. Mostly burnt items. Coffee, chocolate, malts and some graininess to it. Taste was almost the same as the nose. Some bittersweet chocolate starts out and gives away to a grain/malt middle and finishes with some coffee flavors that lasts into the aftertaste. Finishes quite dry which was surprising. I was expecting it to be a little more wet aftertaste to it. But a very nice cream stout and worth checking out for sure.","necoadam","May 25, 2004"

Great appearance...decent chunky head...nice lacing and almost jet black appearance. Robust smoky malt aroma wafts the nostrils very nicely. Taste is rich, malty and full-bodied, with a hop finish that dries the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is excellent..a combination of smoothness with an astringent dryness that I like in a good stout. Very easy on the drinkability scale...mouthfeel invites you to sip again. Highly recommend.","edchicma","May 19, 2004"

Nose has nice coffee aroma, also hints of bitter-sweet chocolate and sweet malt, start is sweet with a rich in roasted grain profile, the top is middling in its feel. Finish has a meaningful acidity, the hops delectable and a bit spicy, very dry almost vinous aftertaste, a quite nice stout and it compliments the Porter quite nicely.","Gusler","May 18, 2004"

It is also full of black malts which add a nice crisp aroma. The taste is good. It has a sweet rich chocolate flavor that finishes creamy. It has a good black malt underbelly. The mouthfeel is good.

The smell was dark malt with notes of chicory, mollasses, roasted barley, and something sweet. The taste was dark, roasted malt with some sweetness (oatmeal? cream?) and a distinct, resinous hop bitterness especially in the finish that reminded me more of an imperial stout than a cream stout. The flavor was best up front, but became too dry and bitter in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but with a very bitter finish. The body was medium-full with low carbonation. The finish was dry with an astringent, hoppy aftertaste. This was an OK stout, but not what I expected.","UncleJimbo","Feb 07, 2004"
4.01,4.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"First things first, I'd buy this beer for the bottle alone. I appreciate a nice label but this beer goes all the way with presentation. It poured up nice producing a tan, frothy head that ligered a bit before fading back to the beer. The color was very nice, a deep red color that at first isn't noticable but comes out when held to the light. A nice aroma that has a hint of a cocoa fragrance. The first taste was very nice. It has a full flavor and a smooth mouthfeel. I was a bit surprised to find out how thin it ended up being. I was expecting more from cream stout. The flavor is good and again has a taste of cocoa in it. Very easy to drink which was evident from the glass always seeming half empty left with some nice lacing.

3.48,-9.6,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a not-quite-opaque black, brown around the edges. The head is weak and fades into a weather pattern. The aroma is odd. Something like a chocolate-flavored sour cream. That sour cream thing had me concerned, but at the first sip, I noticed no sourness and I never did pick up a sourness in the flavor. The flavor is heavy on the cream, slight coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is slick and oily. Quite the interesting beer.","aracauna","Jan 14, 2004"

The nose is full of roasted malts and a touch of hops. The mouth is mildly carbonated with a body consistency similar to milk. The taste opens with smooth roasted nuts and thick milk, perhaps half and half. This sensation is followed by a strong coffee-like bitterness. The coffee and milk combination sounds like a cappuccino, but that's not quite right. Perhaps espresso with milk would be closer. The aftertaste is mainly roasted bitter, but the milkiness lingers, too. This beer leaves a very nice impression.","Globetrotter","Nov 13, 2003"

3.48,-9.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a jet black with a cocoa colored head that had medium to low retention. After dissapting to thin film, this left moderate lacing. Aromas were of burnt chocolate, sweet barley malts and a bitter hoppiness. Flavors included a sweeter chocolate taste, and a strong hop presence along with a roasty maltiness. The carbonation was low, which I like, but the mouthfeel was a little thin and watery. This didn't effect the taste, but I would have prefered it to be a little silkier, smoother. Not a bad stout, but nothing extraordinary.","nixhecks","Oct 01, 2003"

The aroma is distinctly of chocolate malts. The palate is quite creamy and chocolaty with strong notes of Irish Cream. The rich flavors along with the lack of carbonation give this brew more of a rich liqueur feel then I would have expected. There are some slight roasted notes towards the end that linger a little bit in the aftertaste as a slight bitterness. Not much hops here, just some subtle hints towards the end. The mouthfeel is flat... no carbonation anywhere. This really makes the beer flop, and IÂm wondering if I got a bad bottle. Had there even been a slight bit of carbonation here it could have sent this one over the top. This was quite a sweet brew that would definitely be suited as an after dinner or desert beer.","byrd","Sep 30, 2003"

My only complaint in the flavor department is that the roasted coffee flavor was so good, I wanted more. But you can't have everything eh?.
