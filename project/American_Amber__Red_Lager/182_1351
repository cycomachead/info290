4.21,23.8,5,4.5,3.75,4.75,4.25,"Overall, Yuengling is a class-act American style beer. I have graded this beer on what its purpose is, as I think is only fair. It's a damn-sight better than budweiser, and it should be recognized as such. If I ever get some foreign friends together I'm taking them to Quaker-Steak & Lube and we're getting a Lube-Tube of Yuengling. THAT is what this beer is to me. Of course it's for easy drinking. It has an easy-open cap for crying out loud. No bottle-opener required, and that's for a good reason.","McGooTheWise","Mar 29, 2015"

4.21,23.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a clear dark copper/brown color with a cream-colored sudsy head that dissipates rather quickly.  Minimal lacing detected.  Good looking pour.  Nothing too strong on the nose with some caramel and roasted corn, a little bit of barley husk.  Taste is surprisingly complex given the weak nose.  Immediately picked up the sweetness of the beer with caramel and nuttiness.  This gave way to floral notes of apple and pear followed by some pleasant bitterness that gave it a clean, crisp finish.  Flavors are well crafted.  Great bang for the buck.","Durhamia","Mar 23, 2015"

3.68,8.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 12/11/2014. Pours slightly hazy orange/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance dark/toasted malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, apple, pear, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of dark/toasted malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly clean for a lager, there is some fruitiness present, but not too much. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a nice Vienna lager style. All around good robustness and balance of dark/toasted malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 21, 2015"

For your more craft-tilted consumer, you will find little to hang your hat from in either major area, from aroma to taste.  This is your classic, basic, simple adjuncty beer, with a slightly danker and toasty twinge due to its “amber” background.  Thinking honestly here, most of you reading this have probably had a Yuengling or two in your day, as it is certainly a stepping stone into the craft realm.  Having rated everything else available at our hotel bar in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, we took this as a rating nightcap, as we’d realized we hadn’t yet written it up yet.

Even if it's not one of your favorites, you have  to appreciate that there's decent beer available at a great price.  I was a little afraid I wouldn't like this one as much after trying some of the great beers I've stumbled across in the past month or so, but it turns out I had nothing to worry about--if  anything, I might actually appreciate Yuengling's traditional lager a little more now than I did back before I'd tried more exotic beers like Belgian dubbels and IPAs.

Always has that dark amber appearance, great smell, great taste and drinkablity where u can drink them all day long.

I got a case of Samuel Adams, and the beer was to strong for me to like. Then there's the 36 packs for 20 dollars that don't have a good taste. Its like I have to force myself to drink.

Although it has been said before, Ill say that this is the crappiest beer a craft drinker can enjoy and the nicest beer a macro drinker can enjoy. This to me is the perfect american adjunct lager. When I visited the tour in Pottsville they proudly boasted of using American corn grits in the malt bill. This is cheap beer done right, it is full of flavor and has a beautiful appearance. The clean, crisp finish makes you beg for another. After having it in many forms I personally prefer it best just straight from the can.","Tuck_leepulin","Aug 04, 2014"

It was the best choice by far. I had never had it before and thought that it might be worth sampling. I was so surprised. This beer is a very nice American lager. It has none of the drawbacks of either light beers, with their insipid, weak so-called flavor, nor the nasty after-taste of Budweiser's King of Beers. I would definitely buy this beer to have a good, standard American Lager on hand. It tastes great, has a nice full feel and a wonderfully clean finish. (Secret: It's a lot better than PBR.)","Robert_G","Aug 04, 2014"

It's really all in comparison as to how good you think it is. If you are used to drinking 10 dollar a six pack craft beer, it's going to be bland. If you drink run of the mill beers, it is going to be a joy to drink and have a lot of flavor. Over all, better than nothing.","Phillip_Decooch","Jul 12, 2014"

They have a brewery in Tampa, yet many local bars still charge import price for it. Worlds better than BudMillerCoors. It is a bit skunky, likely due to the green bottles, with a taste that reminds me of cardboard (only in a good way). There is a bit of hop but the primary taste is malt. I found it makes a mean black-and-tan with Guinness Draft.","cb500rider","Jul 05, 2014"

No complexity just your average big brewery lager flavor. Mouthfeel was light and easy to drink. These aren't bad beers and can definitely be enjoyed on a hot day but after having dived deep into the world of craft beer, they just don't deliver the flavor and complexity that I crave.","lochef81","Jun 24, 2014"

If you think that Yuengling is just another bland, fizzy, watery American lager then you're likely to be pleasantly surprised. This is a beer with just enough going for it to make it appealing to thirsty craft beer lovers who somehow find themselves stuck in a BMC bar; it's an unpretentious brew that won't sweep you off your feet, but definitely holds its own and then some against the majority of macros out there. Yuengling is a good, economical choice if you're throwing a shindig and want to introduce BMC drinkers to Something Else.","OldeSchool","Jun 21, 2014"

3.81,12.1,3.75,3.25,4,4,4,"Yuengling Traditional Lager brewed by Yuengling Brewery. This brew has an ABV of 4.4 and it pours out a dark amber color. Also this brew has a small white head. This is a filtered brew with some carbonation. You can see right though it. I like the look of this brew. Yuengling is a amber/red lager, not an American style lager. The smell is ok, you pick up aromas of grasses, grains and richness. There is little to no lacing on the glass. The taste is smooth and rich with flavor. The Aftertaste is bold with flavor, but it is smooth and rich. There is nothing bad to say about this brew. Yuengling Traditional Lager has a nice balance to it. Mouthfeel is nice smooth with a clean finish. This brew is also crisp and clean. Over ll I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jun 05, 2014"

My virgin tastebuds thought it was chinese (because before i knew better i thought it was) and tasted outside of the (now awful) usual bud-light 97% of the losers surrounding me drank. I found it on tap at my favorite watering-hole for $3/pint back in 2012. Maybe it was the price but we began a relationship that brought me to new highs. I visited the tampa brewery back then and really like the fact it was a family that just grew with the demand. It wasn't a corporate brand and to me it seemed like a good thing that did it the right way. I could go on about why I love Yuengling but to me this beer has a place in my heart. It will always be my go-to beer and thats why it deserves 5/5 all the way. It has a slight toasted and subtle caramel flavor. you could drink it all day and not go overboard. it puts you in the right place. The story behind it and the ever expanding dreams of production make it taste better. On tap, in the bottle, or poured into my 180 year anniversary commemorative glass, it all tastes good. Its more American than any beer out there. Its the oldest beer and its quintessentially ( whatever that means) the life-blood of patriots who know a good time. To me theres beers I'll like, new tastes I'll enjoy but they'll always be Yuengling.","Ryfree24","May 28, 2014"

There are better beers but they're not nearby, they're prohibitively expensive for daily consumption or their alcohol content makes for an early evening.

4.05,19.1,4,4,4,4,4.25,"Once again, this isn't a world beater. It isn't going to hold its own against a huge Russian Imperial Stout or some other monster of a brew, but that's not what it's designed to do anyway. This is an adjunct American lager, and if one compares it to others of that style, this comes off looking quite good. I would say it's my absolute favorite of the style, being everything it should be -- easy to drink, tasty, palate-cleansing, refreshing, inoffensive -- and nothing it shouldn't -- sour, so carbonated it bites back, gassy, etc. There are times when a big, heavy brew just isn't what you want, when you feel more like an easy to drink lager that will satisfy you without having to deal with a taste that turns your stomach. In my opinion, this really can't be beat for those times. It's a style that gets no respect among craft drinkers and beer geeks, especially new ones who feel that now that they've discovered "real" beers they have to denigrate "that nasty cheap stuff", and for the most part, the style deserves a bit of that. This brew stands out from that crowd in a great way. Not world class, but best of its class.","jokelahoma","Mar 03, 2014"

Taste is light malt forward with a slight metallic aftertaste, light mouthfeel. Very simple and very little hop character. This used to be a novelty beer for me, when you couldn't get it around here and my Pennsylvanian friends would import it. Now that it's in every drug store, it's just a decent cheap beer to put in the fridge when my brother in law is coming over.","HerculesRM","Feb 09, 2014"

Nose is enticing with a light sweet grain , a touch herbal and grass, plus a bit of light citrus faintly in the background. The taste is darn good. This beer has a mouthfeel that is light and thin but a flavor that is very full. The citrus stays int he background and the bitterness from the grass is light. The sweet grain comes close to caramel but stops appropriately and stays a crisp and very clean lager. Sweet, grassy and light with plenty of flavor. You could drink this all day.","utopiajane","Feb 07, 2014"

Beautiful crispness and bite with each swig, and a nice amber color to complement a beautiful pour. But forget that man, this is enjoyed right from the bottle. When its ice cold it is delicious and dangerously drinkable. As it warms you get more of the hop bite which is pretty cool. Definitely a beer you can drink 12 of or enjoy with a meal. Yuengling is a terrific beer, in my opinion a perfect beer. I could drink this year round. Living in the northeast, the scarcity and mystique of it only adds to its legend.

I realize it's not comparable to any craft brew but it's light years ahead of a typical AAL. The flavor is there but it almost disappears before you realize it was there. The flavor is almost smokey but still smooth. I feel like this beer is what you would get if you added a few ounces of water to a Sam Adams Boston Lager. Overall, a good buy and worth trying if you have the opportunity.","18CGL","Oct 05, 2013"

OCCASION: last revisiting the old classic...had too much at cousin Missy's wedding last night--cheers...APPEARANCE: uneven, variably sized bubbles lodge and flutter in a brown-orange body; two-finger head settles to an off-white iced tea head that does not lace... AROMA: scents of peanut and toasted bread in the malty profile; hops provide little other than some funky undertones...PALATE: like medium-bodied, this begins with some strength but ends oily in the throat; aftertaste more than lingers...TASTE: definite bread amid vegetable elements; a bit of bubblegum too... OVERALL: a Northeastern PA sessions staple--one can order by simply saying "lager" in most establishments; this profiles as a beer with a strong odd-tasting dimension; relatively easy-drinking and very affordable, the lager ranks above mass-marketed faux pilsners but below many craft lager offerings; the label reminds us this beer was pioneered when colors (amber, in this case) were the distinguishing aspect of the industry...","dacrza1","Aug 31, 2013"

It's far better than the BMC crowd, but can't hold a candle to most "craft" offerings. If you happen to like this, enjoy it, and know the brewery is a family owned operation, good people, and does a lot for their community.","MikeWard","Aug 31, 2013"

The beer pours a good amber, the taste is very nice with food and it feels good holding it in my mouth for a short swallow. I don't drink American beer as a rule, but there are a couple of regionals that I always enjoyed and this is one. I hope mass producing it doesn't ruin it.

Did find a 6-pack while in Jackson, Tennessee a few weeks back. Sampled 8/29/13 for this review. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. Pours in a pool-ball pislner glass (#13). From American's oldest brewery, 1829. Contains 4.4% alcohol (not on label). Pours a pretty copper/bronze color with a small creamy tan head that leaves some lacing when sipped. Lots of bubbles streaming up from the bottle of the glass, but perfect carbonation actually. The aroma is of grains and corn. The taste is pretty much the same with a hint of caramel and very easy to drink. No harsh aftertaste.","BeerWithMike","Aug 30, 2013"

I am not affiliated with the company, but sincerely think this is the best beer to drink on a regular basis. The color, smell, taste and carbonation is near perfect, and is a very drinkable beer. Sometimes I drink it out of a glass, and other times I drink it out of the bottle. When I go to a restaurant that has it on tap, I get it on tap, and it is awesome.

I used to be able to tatse more corn grits in this but not so much now. A little more bitter then ur nomal adjunt with a little carbantion bite and a tade of the citrus throuh the swallow.

The thick foamy lager is a must for any season. Upon taking your first sip you can feel the carbonation tart your tounge in sourness. Overall it's a great beer. While not a summer craft or seasonal Sam Adams it tops my list as #3 of my all time favorite summer beers.","Ed_Sandy","Jul 08, 2013"

4.84,42.4,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"Anyways when poured it comes out in my glass with an amber brownish color. Following a nice head. Even the head tastes good without it being overpowering in the glass. But it definitely lets you know its there. The smell is reminiscent of a good lager. Hints of barley, malts, and something I can't really put my finger on. Tastewise...I may get some ball busting for this but to me it tastes like if Sam Adams Boston Lager had a baby with Miller Genuine Draft. Very well brewed with some bite to it. Through the bottles there isn't too much carbonation so it works well in the mouth. Overall Yuengling Traditional Amber Lager is one of the best beers out there. There aren't any other beers I would drive 200mi+ there and back to buy or pay extra for someone else to get for me. Easily one of the best lagers I've ever drank. If given the chance I do recommend trying Yuengling Lager. You won't regret it.","bullseyestrat","May 26, 2013"

Now as a real review, the beer is pretty average and good overall brew to have for a party. One finger head that quickly expires after a few minutes. Almost zero head retention. No real noticeable smell, a little malt, some floral notes I guess. Almost a chemical type nose and mouthfeel. I get large carbonation feel and aftertaste. Almost seems to transition to a watery taste. Maybe my tolerance is now sky high but it tastes more like 2%. I get a little bit of sweetness and some dryness. It's very drinkable, like I said, a good party beer. Decent and inexpensive, brings me back to my college years.","rjp217","May 15, 2013"

It was once available only within a limited area from Pottsville, PA. Now, I am finding it all over the country. Where you find this beer at normal premium beer prices like Bud and other typical American lagers, it is an excellent bargain. I find it selling at import prices in some parts of the country, but it is considered "local beer" around Baltimore, making it pretty irresistable as an all-rounder daily brew.","xrayzebra","May 12, 2013"

It was one of the first "micro" brews you could that was not outrageous in price while I was in college. Anyway, the color when poured from the can (I have had this in the bottle and on draft many times but this time its cans, and I do prefer it in cans better) amber not too much lacing but a some head that dissipates quickly. The smell is sweet with some hop character but not a lot, not as much as in bottles but a little skunk in there as well. The taste is over all well balanced for a lager, much better than many in its category and is very sessionable, and I can attest to the many sessions I have had with this one over the years. All in all people may look down on this one but it really is a good beer, it has a great lager flavor and you can drink several without any trouble. Once again this is one of my standby beers if I plan on drinking a several in a night.","humuloner22","Feb 15, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, and some skunky aromas that fade out as the beer warms up, bringing out a sweet caramel aroma. Taste is of malt, grain, and a slight caramel flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer for the style but it's drinkable for what it is.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 06, 2012"

Poured the beer out of the can and got a light reddish amber color beer with a thin head and hardly any lacing or retention, but quite carbonated. The smell had some sweet candy like aroma along with a grass and grain smell. The tatse starts out with some sweet malts followed by some citrus hops and finishing off with some graininess. The sweetness and the bitter hops stay throughout and into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and smooth. This is not too bad of a beer, I'd drink it again if it was offered to me or maybe buy a 6 pack if I see it in a store, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.","DannyDan","Sep 28, 2012"

Pours a beautiful amber color with about a one finger white head that leaves a nice lacing. Smells somewhat nutty and toasted but nothing too great. Very drinkable and somewhat sweet taste. One thing of note about Yuengling Lager (or pretty much any Yuengling I've tried) is the high carbonation. This makes it a rather filling beer and difficult to drink a large quantity, which can be good or bad depending on the situation. Overall, while Yuengling Traditional Lager isn't anything particularly special, it is very good for what it is. I would easily take a Yuengling over any other domestic macro-brew.","tiki51","Sep 17, 2012"

The head dissipated quickly and left some lacing on the glass. On the nose, I got a bit of malt and some bready-ness. On the taste, I notice that this was way too cold. What I can get is a mild nuttiness and some malts and no real bitterness to speak of. The carbonation is plentiful and pleasant. The finish was very quick with a hint of sweetness. This is definitely better than any macro and because it’s so widely distributed (at least on the East Coast), it’s at almost every bar. This brew was simple, but satisfying. There isn’t really much more that I can say about this beer, because the success of it lies in it’s simplicity. There’s just not much going on, which is why it can go down so easily. This isn’t a beer that you have to search out, but if your choices are Coors, Bud and Miller and Yuengling, grab a bottle of this.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

The bottled beer was not as good, having the same skunky smell as other green bottled beers (Heineken, Stella Artois, etc.). The cost to me for the two cases was $20 each, which makes this beer a great value when compered to other "grocery store" beers.","philthyb","Aug 15, 2012"

The smell is of caramel malt, sweet candy, And very mild hops. The taste somewhat follows the smell. Slight hops, slight malt, and some adjunct. Slight caramel malt as well. But that's about it for flavor. The mouthfeel is very adjunct like, But with an ever so slight presence of burnt malt in the finish.

It's about as average a beer as you can get. Very little smell and flavor. I can see the appeal in this, it's better than the typical BMC swill but it's not flavorful enough to be offensive to your typical BMC drinker. So perhaps a good gateway beer? Honestly I'd take any Sam Adams brew over this for a gateway beer, but at the same time I can see the appeal.

Easy drinking, medium-light bodied, amply carbonated, crisp and refreshing. Mild malty aroma; taste is lightly sweet; caramel, pale malt, hints of floral hops.

3.68,8.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good Red Lager, it had some good simple flavors while keeping the clean flavors and high drinkability of an AAL. This beer had great drinkability, it went down really smooth, it was also crisp and refreshing, I could see drinking more then a few of these while doing some grilling in the summer, a very drinkable beer, as any good lager should be. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, all aspects of this beer were pretty on par for a Red Lager. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly higher amount of sweetness and that it came in a green bottle, but those two things weren't really a big deal and hardly affect my overall score. I would buy this beer pretty often if it was available in Michigan, but since it isn't I can only get some when I or someone I know takes a trip down south. I highly recommend this to just about anyone, just a good drinkable Lager. Yuengling makes a pretty good Lager, now I see why this beer is so popular, I know that if I could buy this in MI I would probably have this in the fridge at all times, especially in the summer. I would really like to see Yuengling come to MI and I am pretty interested in trying their other beers, I hope to drink some more soon, this is one solid Lager.","StoutHunter","Apr 08, 2012"

One characteristic of note, only visible over a long longitudinal study of this beer, is that there is an element of biscuitiness that ebbs and flows from case to case. Could be due to faster and slower turnover in different geographic markets, but something to look for.

My beer palate has expanded drastically since then but I have never grown tired of the taste of lager, as I have with so many other beers. It is one of the best session beers while watching a game as it goes down easy, tastes good, and costs the same as BMC products. It isn't world class, or even great, but all things considered it is pretty good, especially for the cost.","NoLeafClover44","Feb 06, 2012"

If you have not tried it do not expect to be blown away intricate tastes and aromas, but do expect it to be a great taste and an extremely easy drink.","acidmojojojo","Jun 23, 2011"

It's not great by connoisseurship standards, but it's far better than the usual offerings at a casual neighborhood gathering. Pours a clear copper with one finger of off-white head with good retention. Aromas are chalk full of graininess and the smell of a countryside breeze, but has little in the way of hops. Flavor was clearly considered by the brewers, who vested this brew with light malts balanced by light notes of English Breakfast Tea.

It smells of sweet carmel malts, bread crumbs, and has that BMC aluminum can smell. It actually tastes pretty sweet. It has this sweet maltyness which isn't too shabby and it is sweeter out of the can than from the bottle. I'm actually surprised at how much better this one tastes out of the can.

The flavor was much better than others of the style I've have before. The taste is the aroma plus a tiny hint of citrus. The body is good and it goes down with just a bit of twinge on the tongue.

Smell is slightly metallic with hints of corn husk and sweet-slightly molasses-y. Tastes of light carmel/molasses with a husky feeling in the nose. A slight pinch of hops at the end balances out the malty sweetness.

Nose smelled like pure, unadulterated lager - slightly sweet with a mild maltiness that was pleasant to take in. Mouthfeel was medium with a lager sweetness on the tongue. It seems pretty unobtrusive to me these days, having been a self-avowed hophead and then getting on The CANQuest (TM) kick, which led to a LOT of AmeriCAN Adjunct Lager consumption. This struck me as a nice, easy-drinking beer that I could easily use to fill a cooler for a picnic or a barbecue. The ABV is reasonable and the taste is not going to put anybody off.

It is very affordable at IGA, roughly $4 for a 6 pack. Pretty good buzz compared to any other Lager. The tatse is exceptional, however the labeling can be deceiving.

Just a little bit of bite from the hops, but nothing else overpowering. Some sweetness from the malt, which seems to be responsible for the lingering aftertaste.

This is anything but a resemblance to the Light American Lagers of AB-InBev or Miller Coors. The bottle states "Original Amber Beer", and while one should not expect the mouthfeel or body of a craft Amber Ale, the malt character certainly defines this beer as a clean and refreshing lager with well balanced flavor and bitterness. A light lager with definition and clarity is refreshing and enlightening.

A little heavier than most macrobrewed lagers (as Yuengling is hardly small anymore) but not as overbearingly in your face as some micros. A great middle of the road choice. Excellent compliment to a chargrilled burger!","crhensel","Dec 31, 2009"

Sure, it doesn't just taste like corn adjunt, but theres not much malt or hop to the flavor, either. I suppose its the type of thing people want to have a party where you can drink a lot of it and there is still not too much flavor..

Pour is fine - amber color with a ton of busy bubbles seen through the crystal clear beer. Small slighty off-white head that dissolves quickly. Nose is grainy malt - some sweet corn in there. Nothing much else going on. Flavor is similar. Corny water in the back of the mouth, then stronger dirty candy malt with that graininess still. A little waterier than I'd expect.

I could see this beer being pretty good if it were super fresh, but the green bottles might have done this one in quicker than normal. Watery and light-bodied.

Well probably because you're one of the millions of people that are tired of BMC and are looking for a "better beer." This beer is just as flavorless as Bud, except for the fact that its a different color. Sure there's more flavor than in bud, but I don't think that you could possibly brew anything in this style that had less flavor. If you're looking to step up from bud to a beer that has a bit more flavor but is still flavorless then this is for you. Bud drinkers like this because it makes them feel "high class."

It is boutique macro lager with a darker color and a wee bit more body and flavor - or so your eyes tell you when you see it in your glass. I like the brewery's history and longevity, but I'm not fond of the way it has positioned itself in the market as virtual craft beer (in the eyes of the college boys who think they're going upmarket on this one). Around my neck of the woods it is the same price as Coors Banquet, so I'll just stay honest and drink the Coors. It's a good beer though if you find yourself in a dismal bar that only has Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light, and Corona. It tastes of faint crystal malt and some corn, and often wet cardboard.

Aroma is hoppier than your average 'macro'...faint hop smell, but it is present, mixed with yeasty aromas and a bit of that adjunct smell...reminds me of the budweiser brewery to be honest. Not ultra psyched at this point. Taste is a letdown...it's very bud like, it's clean but watery, and nonthreatening. I don't mind it...but its not an amazing taste. Less aftertaste than bud, i'd say, and that is an improvement. Warmed up, its more of the same. On the whole, the more I drank the less I liked, much like when I drink a macro. One is plenty...the rest of the bottle ended up getting sampled by friends and drain-poured in one way or another. Better than bud, I guess. Overall, its a cheap beer (price), and if I were local and the kind of person that felt like this was the kind of beer to turn to when hot and sweaty, I'd choose this over others. But I'm not. So the bottom line for me is, it has adjuncts that do not enhance the flavor, and it is very noticeable, and I I like the flavor of beer so I don't want it tamed down or muted by flavorless adjuncts...so give me a malty pale ale or a good pils instead.","Liquids","Jul 14, 2007"

Taste is a very light and subtle balance of sweet-corn/malt and bittering hops. Carbonation makes this a crisp, light and refreshing beer. No surprises as far as taste; it's just a simple light refresher that's a few notches better than Bud/Miller/Coors. A bit better than Killian's because of the slight edge in hop flavor.

In the taste there's more hops here than in your typical macro-lager and the toasted grain comes through as well. Adjuncts seem to have been used sparingly. This brew's main failing is in mouthfeel.

Pours a gorgeus amber color though has a less than impressive smell. I would expect a richer smell because of the color but i didnt give up on it yet. It pours a good 2" head at first and dissipates to about a half a centimeter in a few minutes. I swirled it around and found the lacing to be more than average but not extraordinary. Has a malty taste but finishes very clean all over the pallet. Not as wattery as BMC, but just a little thicker.

The taste is similar with a slight creaminess with a normal amount of bitterness. For a lager the taste is full-bodied and finishes strong to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and not overly fizzy.

5,47.1,5,5,5,5,5,"This is my first review because this is my favorite beer. At this point, I know about where the quality of this brew is, which is good, but not superlative. (It does pass the only two quality tests I know of though. If you serve it warm, it still tastes fine, and there's not a beer I've ever tried that will make the taste of Yuengling Traditional suffer if you try them head to head) The reason why it still stands up as my favorite is because I've got moderate taste, and because this is my go-to beer. It is pretty good at everything in my opinion. You can use this as a session beer, you can drink it with food, you can drink it on a hot day. There's no time I can think of where you might want a beer where you could go wrong with Yuengling Traditional Lager. That said, I think its hard to beat the appearance in the green bottle (no problem with skunking for me since I live less than a day's drive from the brewery). The contrast of green bottle and dark lager is pleasing. Its head is not reliable, but reaches a respectable size when it does form and it does usually leave a bit of lacing. The smell is about what a beer should smell like. Yeasty and malty with some tang from the hops. Taste is more of the same. Malt and some noticable yeast. It tends more towards sweet than bitter, but there is little bitter there for balance. The most consistent "notes" I detect is a little grass and maybe a really faint bit of citrus. One of my favorite things about Yuengling Traditional Lager are the hops they use. I don't know the variety, but they are one of my favorites because they add an interesting and fairly complex flavor without excessive bitterness (something few beers do). For some reason the taste seems to be more pronounced in the bottle. The aroma and more suble taste aspects of the hops can dissapate in a pint glass sometimes Also, I notice at least one person ahead of me said this has no "adjunct" ingredients. I'm not sure this is true. If there are added "adjuncts", sure they're low on the list, and definately there's no rice, but I suspect there may be some corn in here. Though that may just be the yeast and hops messing with me because the corn is another thing I can only seem to get from the bottle. Anyway, the mouthfeel... pretty medium (surprise!). This is also a plus for me. Its heavy enough so that I know I'm drinking a real beer, but it still slides down easy. For this reason drinkability gets a really high rating. Between the consistently pleasant taste, and the not too heavy feel, Yuengling Traditional Lager goes down really easy. As I try new beers, the chances I'll order one of these has decreased some, I do like variety. But in the end this is still my favorite. And I think its a testament to the good taste of the area I live in that Yuengling Traditional is almost as common around here as Bud/Miller/Coors. Its about the same price besides. Its certainly hard to beat in that respect.","casualbeerman","Dec 29, 2005"

This notion was dispelled when I poured it, as I was greeted by a gorgeous reddish-golden beer with dynamic bubble action. It smells slightly of chemically-coated plastic, but no matter.

It tastes like sort of honey beer. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but it is fun enough to be enjoyed. Overall, it was a pretty good beer on tap. In bottle, it was more average as product.

Sweet malt hits you pretty hard, but it gives way to a very faint hop bitterness and a sort of nutty finish. My only real complaint is that the mouthfeel is a little thin even for the style. Overall, you really can't beat this one for the money; it's way too cheap to be this good and blows everything else at comparable prices flat out of the water.

The flavor was clean, not overly bitter, with caramel malt and toasted bread giving way to a yeasty aftertaste.

Easy to drink because theres nothing much to it, but it sure is better than anything else offered on tap at Olive Garden (Bud, Bud Light and Coors Light). Dont get me wrong. It is a good beer when you match quality with cost, and its a great beer to start your friends out on when you trying to get them away from the aforementioned macros.

It has a crisp carbonation and the taste is malt and grains with a slight hop twang. Mouthfeel is good, and goes down smooth. Has a high drinkability - you can almost pound it like you would a light macro lager. The only reason it loses points on drinkability is that it fills you up quickly. The thing about Yuengling is sometimes you get a skunked batch (light-strunk green bottles is my guess), which I think was the case in this review. Go for the 12-pack or a 22 oz. (which has brown glass) rather than the 6-pack to avoid this. The unskunked has more hop flavor and better mouthfeel.

I think it is a little sweet and could use a little more hops for my taste. Because of the sweetness, I can't drink too many of these at one session. It's better than Miller or Bud, but not on my list if I have Microbrews or Homebrews around. The girls love it, probably due to sweetness.

Big emphases on the grains, not too much happening in the hop department. Again, like the smell, there was an herby earthy quality in there. The mouthfeel was ok, a bit thin for my taste, but again overall not horrible. I gave it a 4 on drinkability as it was very easy drinking. Although it may seem like I panned this brew, overall it was not bad. I would certainly take it over any macro (except maybe Sam Adams), and it certainly is on par with beers like Bass Ale.

It is very good cold, okay a little warmer, and even okay ice cold. The taste is one of grain, hops, and alcohol with a good, slightly thick mouthfeel. It is really easy to drink a lot of these.

Known as simply "lager" (its not going to change either, so quit bitching), the beer has a huge following, and one that is not entirely unfounded. I realize that there are a plethora of more complex, more refined, more expressive and more challenging beers out there. Of course. But taken for what it is, lager is hard to beat. On tap, the beer pours a nice reddish brown color, with a very thin head that quickly disappears. Taste is balanced well, with a foundation of malt that is given some life by a blend of hops. It does not exude any particular hopfeel, and the bitterness is very refrained. It exhibits much more character than any other macro lager out there. Medium-dark, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, and refreshing. I've bought more cases and pitchers of this than any other beer as it goes down easily and tastes great. I know I'm biased, I know there's better, but I know I feel bad for people who are out of the distribution area, as they are missing out on America's best everyday beer.","99bottles","Jul 21, 2003"

In the nose, a sweetish malt dominates with a light hint of fruitiness from the Christian Schmidt yeast. It's light to medium bodied, and gently crisp in the mouth with a fine carbonation that allows it to become slightly creamy as it warms. The flavor delivers a gently sweet malt that's well-infused with a mildly floral hop flavor and low-level bitterness along with the Yuengling house-flavor. It finishes quickly, but leaves a mild residue of sweet malt that continues to build on the palate. An easy drinking beer that's balanced towards sweetness, but still remains enjoyable for a few.","NeroFiddled","Jul 08, 2003"

At first pour you will notice this beer has a very nice chesnut color to it with a decent head which does provide some lacing. As you inhale the aroma you can sense a sort of pungentness found in many euro mass brewed lagers like Becks. As far as taste goes, unlike many american lagers out there Yuengling actually has some, its quite nutty with a little bit of a hop flavor towards the end. The only real problem i have with this beer is that it has a tendancy to go flat a bit quicker than others. If you were looking for a highly drinkable beer for a bbq or camping trip yuengling lager would absolutely be a great pickup, especially at 16 dollars a case.

That's only about the beer's image though. The beer itself is quite good. It pours with that famous amber color with a head that diminishes as quickly as it forms. The taste has a malty sweetness and the hops lend a slight citrusy dryness. It's very well balanced which makes this way better than any other macro. I'd call this an all purpose beer.

Yuengling Traditional Amber Lager was a beer we all yearned for, considering most days we drank mostly Coors Light and Busch. She pours with an amber brown hue, with heavily carbonated white colored head. The aroma consists pimarily of sweet malt possibly caramel, and there is a weak but present hop like aroma. I would like to the thank the Yuengling family for keeping up a better product than the macros out there and keeping their beers moderately priced. The lighter bodied beer has a rather thin texture, and it does annoy me that most of the time this beer gets way to much credit as being the good stuff. When in reality it is a mediocre beer that is great for getting people away from the fizzy yelllow brews this country mainly has to offer. A relatively sweet, but mostly bitter crisp finish forms a classic taste that I cherish.

While I am admittedly biased, increased tasting experience has led me to recognize it as a good overall American amber. I'm not sure if its reputation among devotees or perhaps less serious beer drinkers as a "nectar of the gods" is completely justified, however. Nonetheless, I do enjoy this beer greatly. For this review, the bottle poured a nice clear, amber color, with a thin head and very little lacing. Only a few carbonation bubbles rose to the surface, giving the beer a slightly flat apperance. I noted some traces of corn in the aroma, with a slight malt smell, too. There was also a small, indecipherable metallic odor, but nothing overpowering. The taste had a good hop/malt balance with a very pleasing hop bitterness in the aftertaste. There was also a slight corn taste (I believe it's used as an adjunct in brewing), but the Lager gets away with it. This beer felt very creamy and the medium body had a smooth mouthfeel. Yuengling Traditional Lager remains an eminently drinkable beer, and will always be a welcome fall-back brew for me.","SchmichaelJ","Dec 05, 2002"
