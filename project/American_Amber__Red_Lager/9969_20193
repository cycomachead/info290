Aroma and flavor are pretty malty with a nice hops bite and a slightly lingering bitterness from the hops. Medium bodied and smoothly carbonated. Overall I see no reason why I wouldn't buy it again when I'm in the mood for a red. This brewery hasn't disappointed me so far.","AlCaponeJunior","May 01, 2014"

The beer pours a dark amber-red with a thin, white, foamy head. There was a light aroma of semi-sweet caramel, but very subtle. Flavors are dark toasted malt initially, with some subtle hopping at the end. Smooth, but watery, especially on the finish. The aftertaste is sweet and slightly balanced with hops. This is an average red, and would make a decent go-to for guests that may not be fans of craft in general to start them on the road of transition.","GarthDanielson","Apr 30, 2011"

Mouthfeel was nice, and smooth, however, with medium carbonation levels. Drinkability was below average, this beer just wasn't too appealing to me.

Not a bad flavor, just sort of one sided and somewhat normal like a Killians, but I admit that it is definitely better than Killians.

The aroma is very light, consisting light malts, and what smells like grain. The taste is also a bit lacking in flavor, starting with a hint of malts, and ending with a touch of hops. By no means complex. Smooth light mouthfeel. If it were'nt for the lack of flavor, this could be a very drinkable ale, but no flavor equals bad beer. Overall, this just seemed like a "light beer."

However, this brew doesn't have the complex malt flavors of other darker lagers I have tried. That being said, I still really like the taste of this beer. This would be a great choice to give to the guy who thinks all "dark beers" taste very strong, and introduce him to the wonderful world of craft beer. I would defenitely buy it again.","AustinBeerLvr","Jul 11, 2007"
3.82,13.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Smells of low malty sweetness Â– toasty caramel - low fruity floral hop. Pours orange copper Â– clear Â– low head. Tastes of warm malt Â– low floral hop Â– lightly spicy Â– caramel sweetness Â– nice little tartness Â– medium-low bitterness. Thin body Â– medium spicy carbonation Â– tart with just a hint of dryness. Final thoughts: Really grows on me. A smooth and refreshing, easy, nice summer beer.

2.95,-12.5,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Tried this while visiting my folks in Arlington - a bit disappointing. Flavor is generic malty, nothing amazing. Little head, minimal body. My impression was that it reminded me of a Samuel Adams Boston Lager that had been watered down. The other reviews of this beer were rather more positive, perhaps I just stumbled upon a bad batch.","aappleby","May 22, 2007"
3.35,-0.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A rather pedestrian beer. Maybe a decent session brew. Not really bad or good, I'd say. Brewed to compete with Shiner maybe? It's a little lighter, dryer and crisper than Shiner Bock. Maybe a decent alternative. At least it knows what it is, an Amber Lager, instead of calling itself a Bock, which Shiner really is not.","skillerified","Apr 12, 2007"
3,-11,3,3,3,3,3,"Overall impression: meh. Very average amber lager - drinkable, but I certainly wouldn't seek this out again, and would probably take a Shiner instead if given the choice.","rowew","Dec 28, 2006"
2.93,-13.1,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dates. Nice light amber color with a good head to start. The smell was on the bland side and malty without any noticeable hops. I was really hoping to like this one since it's local and wanting to support local efforts. Unfortunately, the taste followed the smell and was pretty bland. It had no hops and was weak and a somewhat watery (mouthfeel very watery as well). There are others in the style that I like so not a style issue. This one is on-par with most macros for me. Don't recommend unless to mark off list. (2.5, NA, ML, N)","TexIndy","Nov 11, 2006"

3.45,2.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours out a clear amber with a thin head that looks like frothed milk. Leaves substantial lacing. I smell a little toasted malt and some graininess. Very faint floral hops. Up front is the sweet, toasty malt with some cutting bitterness and flowery hop flavors. The aftertaste lingers on with some bready notes. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly, but not overly prickly. A little on the watery side. Not Rahr's greatest, but it's all around pretty decent and a great session beer to boot.","goochpunch","Oct 11, 2006"

Aroma is balanced, lightly fruity. Taste has a light malt sweetness, nicely balanced by somewhat generic hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, with a clean finish, and drinkability is very good in the session type of way. A beer to have when you're having more than one, perhaps.","ppoitras","Sep 08, 2006"

Smell is some grain/syrupy sweetness that surely does not offend. Taste is in the same line of smellin, except with some seltzery carbonation to finish the job. This beer sits well in the mouth and stomach, and would be very drinkable with even the greasiest of entrees.","jwff","May 13, 2006"
3.22,-4.5,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"A fair offering from Texas. Pours out to a light amber color with a small white head. Medium low carboantion, some notes of lace. Aromas of caramel malts and grassy earth. Not bad. Taste was light and slightly bland; dry malts mix with medium bodied hops. Mouthfeel is mediocre, with some smoothness about itself. Drinkability is north of average. This isn't great stuff, but it's definitly worthy of drinking. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample.","Frozensoul327","May 12, 2006"

Smells of lager yeast and muncih malt sweetness.

4.09,21.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Opinion: Well, this style of beer doesnÂ’t mean to be too big, so you canÂ’t expect it to be bold. It does cross your palate like a well intended beer, and not some ill-conceived macro-crap like Zeigenbock or the like. I really like the maltier beers, but I would actually have to say in this case that they may want to bump up the bittering just a tad as it leaves the palate very plain. The sweet balance and attenuation are all good and make it a refreshing, yet sufficiently flavorful beer. I could definitely see buying a 6-pack of this stuff to bring to a get-together when I have to drive myself home.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 14, 2006"

The taste isn't as full-flavored as expected, this seems a little watery. The smooth malt body is enhanced by a caramel flavor mixed with a mild smokiness. A touch of herbal German hop flavor rounds this beer out. Drinkability is good, but, for flavor, there are better amber lager choices out there.","Gagnonsux","Nov 04, 2005"

So, that's not much for constructive criticism, is it? Well... It's very light on the body. Hmm. Looking at the different weights on the different parts I guess I see the problem - too much weight on the appearance. Well, this one sure looks nice - a deep amber with a smallish white head. Yes, the head is quickly gone, but the lacing lasts. The taste isn't, well, bad or anything - it's just so light and airy... There's not much there to taste! No hops, very light malts, thin. I guess that's much my experience with this one - thin... Not bad, or anything, but I can't really see myself going out and buying this to have this, you know?","charlesw","Aug 18, 2005"
3.36,-0.3,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"While this beer pours a beatiful clear pale amber/orange color with a soft and thick cream colored head, the smell is quite subtle. What's there smell pretty nice, but quite muted. The aroma consists of a soft grain with a slight hop presence. The taste is a smooth grainy taste with fresh cut grass notes and a small jagged edge of hop bitterness combined with the carbonation. This is a very light bodied beer that finishes slightly dry and roasty. Despite the somewhat smooth characteristic of this beer, drinkability isn't quite what I expected. Still a solid beer, but perhaps not my favorite style. Nonetheless, I hope Rahr does very well! Thanks to Aunt Beckie for bringing me this beer. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Aug 07, 2005"
3.91,16,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I must say that I do love the Rahr bottle labelsÂ—especially this one with the crimson background and black silhouette of a longhorn head. It sort of has a Â“beast from HellÂ” look to it. As for the beer, it pours a medium amber color with a thick and frothy white head that very slowly recedes into a fluffy laceÂ—very nice. The nose possesses some light floral notes but overall is a bit subdued. The taste begins with lightly caramel malts and a mild fruitiness followed by notes of black tea and a mildly spicy hop bitterness towards the finish. Smooth and easy-drinkingÂ—a great session beer.","Morris729","Aug 02, 2005"

The nose is slight caramel and lotso f other business that I don't like. I would guess its is hop that doesn't giveo ff the good smell, but there is definately something. The flavor is just okay. The hop is not as offensive, but it just tastes dirty with a metallic aftertaste. There is some caramel sweetness in there, but the hop hides it. The feel is rather thin and bubbly. I would like at least a medium body. This is definately not my favorite beer. The nose and flavor are just not nice, and the feel is lacking.","kmpitz2","Mar 02, 2005"
