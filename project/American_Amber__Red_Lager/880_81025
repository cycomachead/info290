I used to have Yuengling Lager as my go to canned format, but this has less of that bubblegummy estery thing going on and all the right malt, yeast and mild hops flavors. I do not see why this is not more popular out in Western PA, and certainly more popular than Yuengling it should be!","Scrapss","Mar 11, 2014"

In the taste, adjunct rice and grain mix with faint malt. Hops are somewhat sour but faint enough to hang in the background. Light bodied and crisp mouthfeel though watery. Overall, this is a very average offering.","Stinkypuss","Jan 04, 2014"

The biggest issue, it should be enjoyed very cold, or it comes off as sour. I've had 4 during an afternoon of hockey viewing, so I'd say it was smooth (in 2 frosted pint glasses).","BeerBatteredPhish","Beers"

4.32,28.6,5,3,5,4,4.5,"Some may find this silly, but I've always been one to stay away from what's "popular". Yuengling's Traditional Lager falls into that category. If you also prefer to walk the path less trodden, I would really recommend trying this brew.","Sipchue","Dec 15, 2012"

3.73,11,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, I think that this is a solid beer considering I only payed 15 dollars for a case on sale. Straub, another old brewery from my home state of PA, made a pretty good beer here to compete with Yuengling it seems and I would much prefer this to a Yuengling any day. This beer is easy to drink, light on the palate, yet still retains a good amount of flavor.","jifigz","Oct 30, 2012"
3.52,4.8,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"O: overall, this is a pretty solid offering from a PA brewery. although i am on the other side of the state, i like to keep it local (or regional if you will). i really enjoyed the roasted malt/smokey character of this brew. as i said, it loses a bit on the watery mouthfeel, almost to the point where i feel as if i'm drinking a light beer. however, the roasted aftertaste and drinkability make up for it. we'll see how i feel about it once this keg is done","paulhargus","Sep 28, 2012"
4.63,37.8,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"This is a good inexpensive beer in Pennsylvania. It's made with Pa mountain spring water from the Laurel Run Reservoir. It's advertised as a beer that contains "no added sugars, salts, preservatives, or synthetic chemicals," making it known as the "natural choice." Yet, Straub uses corn flakes as a source of starch. This is the only con I see with Straub beer. I'm not sure how pure the corn flakes Straub uses are as corn flakes are processed, and moreover, I'd rather drink beer that is not brewed with corn flakes. On the other hand, this beer is one my favorites. It has a great blend of flavors - a hint of sweetness from the malted barley, light hops, and the corn flakes are actually blended nicely in this beer. The flavors are very rich, yet the mouthfeel is not too thick. The color is a nice amber, and this beer gives me an uplifting buzz. Straub is really underrated, and I'd be lying if I didn't give this beer a 5 out of 5 for taste. I prefer Straub Amber Lager over Yuengling any day.","DarkBeer","Sep 18, 2012"

3.24,-3.6,4.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"The Crack and inverted Glug was marvelous, invoking a semi-cascading action and resulting in two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep amber with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. Nose had a faint metallic aspect along with a very grainy malt sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was moderately malty along with a faint metallic tang. Finish was semi-sweet and the lingering flavor was of freshly-milled malt. It was not anything that will knock one's socks off, but it was a good CANdidate for a) a session beer and b) one's summertime cooler. it also represents a real effort on the part of a small, regional brewery to step up their game. If you truly believe in "Buy Local, Drink Local", do not pass up a chance to have some of Straub's beer.","woodychandler","Aug 18, 2012"

3.6,7.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Very easy drinking, something I could always enjoy Straub Lager for when we bought it in 16 ounce returnable bottles back in the early college years. Pours a clear amber with a white foam head, not bad according to one of their local wholesaler reps they derive the color from actual specialty malts not caramel coloring here. Light bready nose, minimal hops, muted with a bit of fruitiness. Flavor has a clean pleasant sliced bread malt flavor with minimal hop bitterness to balance it out, it's fresh and well made for a regional brewer trying to stay afloat. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with even keeled carbonation, nothing overbearing or off on the palate. Overall a well made refreshing amber lager, up there with similar products like Yuengling.","WVbeergeek","May 06, 2012"
