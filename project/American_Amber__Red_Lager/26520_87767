4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/12/2014. Pours lightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of spicy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy amber lager. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 31, 2015"

The nose is loaded with hop bitterness and flavor with pine, candied orange peel, mint, pine sap. Quite spicy. Bread like Munich malt character is present with toffee and burnt sugar. The palate opens mildly bitter with burnt sugar, toasted malt and spicy and fruity hops. Pine, pine sap, mint, green grass, candied oranges, a mild chalky bitterness, mildly gritty. The mid palate has flavors of toast and burnt sugar.  Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer has a long finish with a blend of the Munich malt base and the hop melange. Not wholly harmonious, but still quite enjoyable.","DefenCorps","Nov 30, 2014"

With that being said, it's a very solid hoppy Amber Lager, which to my knowledge, there aren't many of. Great hoppy taste and drinkability, my only complain is a weakish malt backbone. Highly recommend this beer to any hoppy beer fanatic, especially anyone who will appreciate the smoothness of a lager with the hoppiness of a Pale ale.","stella77artois","Jan 19, 2014"

It’s easy to drink and really pleasing if you’re looking to just kick back and drink something immediately tasty and not too crazy, but it’s also great if you’re willing to sit down and look into its depth and complexity. This is really damn good. I’ve always expected good things from Jack’s Abby, but this is very pleasantly well-crafted—awesome beer. Great job, you guys.","fmccormi","Oct 30, 2013"

3.82,-2.8,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"500ml bottle served in pilsner glass. Pours an amber hue with a translucent clarity and a creamy, two-inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a half-inch, rocky cap, leaving delicate strands of textured lacing as the brew recedes. Nose expresses cereal notes - sweet and biscuity, as well as a suggestion of citrus. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a slight caramel character and a light bitterness towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a touch of oiliness and citrus astringency. Overall, not my favorite from this brewer, but a decent offering for the style, nonetheless.","Jwale73","Sep 25, 2013"

3.93,0,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall OK but not great. The malt profile is nice, but the hops don't seem to do as well as I expected in this beer. They're nice hops but bring too much of an American spicy soapy profile to mesh well with the lager and amber malt flavors. Could also have been a bit more crisp. Also, the booze comes through a bit hot, and would be very nice if this was supposed to be 9% instead of 7.2%. I do like that perfumey booze on a doppelbock, but this is a regular bock. That being said, it's still a nice beer with great malt profile, tasty and drinkable.","jlindros","Dec 29, 2012"

Head persisted for a while then dwindled to foamy rafts, nice lacing. Aroma was slightly hoppy, trace citrus, swee malt underneath. The flavor is clean, a little piney, a little floral, nice grapefruit bitterness. Sweet malty flavors underneath. Pretty well balanced. Went nicely with spicy chicken and salsa I was eating. Nice brew. It is Refreshing and a great change from the heavy winter fare. Would be good for friends and food...not too extreme, yet flavorful and would hold its own with hearty grub.","LeRose","Dec 28, 2012"
3.82,-2.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"O/D-Balanced and pretty fun. Not my favorite Jack's offering. Two of their beers are probably somewhere in my top 10-15 all-time beers. This one is not in the same stratosphere but it is well worth the $2.75 half liter price. I will always give their beers a shot. Probably won't go back to this one but it is still better than 50-60% of the beers I will try this month.","VelvetExtract","Dec 27, 2012"
3.73,-5.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O: I'm not quite sure where they were trying to go with this one. The name would suggest a bock kicked up a notch with American hops. Not a bad attempt by any means, but I still find it a bit confusing on the palate. It dries out a bit too much toward the finish, presumably to showcase the hops more, but that kind of curtails the bock aspect of it. Unless my palate deceives me, it seems like there's some specialty malts at play here too. The malt base just doesn't taste as complex as a bock's should, and it makes for some odd flavors (maybe that bubblegum?). Having said all that, this is still a worthy beer at the end of the day.","ryan1788a5","Dec 27, 2012"

Sweet caramel toffee and bready with a spicy earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel.
