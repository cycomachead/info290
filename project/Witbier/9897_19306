3.99,2.3,4,3.75,4,4,4.25,"Pours a cloudy gold with small fluffy white head, good sized cap remains, rings of lace halfway down the glass. Smell: lemony, mildly grainy - sweet, lightly floral. Taste: lemon-lime, cereal grains, bitter orange, lightly tart; mildly acetic and herbal finish. Light bodied, somewhat effervescent but appropriate level of carbonation, drying finish. Pretty straightforward for JP, but really nice wit. 08/14 bottling.","babaracas","Mar 09, 2015"

Bit high on carbonation, but probably right for the style. Crisp flavors, dry finish. Left me wanting another sip. Anxious to try more of their offerings.","Mikus","Mar 05, 2015"

Taste is acidic and tart, dry oak flavours, citrus, orange and lemon, more classic wit flavours of coriander, spice and orange peel is present. Highly carbonated, light to medium bodied, champagne like feel. Not bad, but the excess of carbonation makes this a bit tough to drink a lot of.","peensteen","Aug 14, 2014"

It's a food beer. Three of us enjoyed it with a fried walleye. Nothing could've been better. We all agreed it was a delicious accompaniment. Keep that in mind when you sip this: enjoy every taste. It's one of the best beers I've ever enjoyed. "Good" my eye: it's top dog.","haggadah","Jul 28, 2014"
4.06,4.1,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"A refreshing and balanced wit, maintains the lightness and refreshing spice of a traditional wit while packing some interesting barrel and Brett acidity and tart character. I thought aside from the gush on the open this was a well put together beer, noticeable tart lime and gooseberry flavours along the coriander and citric orange. A bit yeast forward at the start but it flows nicely into the spicy and tart fruit body, I enjoyed the concept and beer, certainly one I would recommend for fans of Brett as well as to have myself again.","mick303","Beers"

4.11,5.4,4,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a good example of a funky White Ale, it had most of the aspects that I would expect in a White Ale and the spices weren't overpowering, but it had just enough funk to identify it as a Jolly Pumpkin beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, slightly prickly, refreshing and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I would have no problem taking out a big bottle or a few of these smaller bottles, especially on a warm day in the summer, I almost wish it came in cans. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and drinkability, I thought they were both very nice and to me they were the highlights of this beer. What I like least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change about this beer. I would buy this beer again and now that it's in smaller bottles I can see myself keeping a couple bottles in the fridge all summer long and I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind a little funk in their beer. All I all I was pretty happy with this beer, I forgot just how easy drinking and refreshing this beer is and on a warm evening like tonight it's really hitting the spot. This isn't my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, but it's still a damn solid addition to their lineup and so far it's my favorite funky White Ale. Great job guys, this was one tasty and refreshing beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","May 22, 2014"

There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

The beer is not a uniform taste, but you taste some acidity, and then the classic wheat beer taste. I also tasted the pumpkin, but more like a syrup that was following a somewhat sour beer. If I can use a cupcake as an analogy, the cake was a bit sour, the frosting tasted like pumpkin. I don't know if this was done in an effort to make it "artisanal", but it worked. I liked it. There was also a good amount of carbonation, and it was not a heady beer, just a good witbier.","JulioH","Feb 18, 2014"

3.83,-1.8,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"a great friend described this beer as the most similar to what everyone else is doing of the jolly pumpkin repertoire. and while this came before many of them, i generally agree with him. this beer is fabulous, no questioning that, but its not as unique and distinct as their others. this is their take on a belgian wild wit, with coriander and orange peel over a pale wheat malt base with lots of classic dexter michigan funk and brightness. blonde beer with great white head, a nose of herbs, almost like a gin, and funky brett. the flavor is wine-like and fruity, with the orange adding quite a bit. complex and tasty, but indeed similar to other wits out there. some others of theirs, fuego and the special brown come to mind, are so entirely their own, while this one sort of flirts with other beers in the same style. its delicious and refreshing, but less separate. could use a touch more carbonation and maybe the same amount more body, this comes through on the thin side, even for a light style. but its yeasty finish makes it awesome. not critiquing this too hard, but their other beers impress me a bit more.","StonedTrippin","Feb 07, 2014"

4.1,5.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/17/2013. Moderate gusher upon opening, took a while to pour this. Pours very hazy golden straw color with a 3 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart lemon, green apple, pear, grape, orange peel, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, wet hay, grass, floral, funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart lemon, pear, green apple, orange peel, clove, pepper, coriander, wheat, hay, grass, floral, funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of crisp tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, clove, pepper, coriander, hay, grass, wheat, floral, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast, spice, and light malt flavors; with a great fruity/spicy balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very crisp, prickly, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oak aged witbier style. All around great balance and complexity of spice and yeast flavors; and extremely crisp and smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 12, 2013"

The unmistakable aroma of brettanomyces-induced light funk and musty earthiness, coriander, hints of citrus, and light accents of oak on the nose. Opens with general light fruitness, coriander, yeasty earthy notes, and grain and wheaty malt. Hints of white pepper give way to the bone-dry finish that ties together musty oakiness and very light tart accents of citrus rind. Abundant carbonation, slick and smooth mouthfeel.

3.53,-9.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"On draft at the brewpub in A2. Pours a hazy light golden with a massive bubbly white fluffy head. Bubbles coming up from the bottom like whoah. Smells of yeast funk, hay, dry coriander spice, a hint of hops. Flavor follows the aroma, with light hay and funky sour yeast, just a hint of the orange peel. Extremely light bodied with high carbonation. A little bland for my tastes overall and would have liked a bit more sweetness.

I particularly like the odd approach of barrel-aging a witbier, a good idea that works in this case and sets it apart from other beers in its family.

4.05,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Batch 964. Bottled 12/8/11. Pours a slightly hazy, golden straw color with a large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite earthy with some oak notes and orange peel. A bit of lemon along with typical JP farmhouse funk. Hints of wheat and coriander with peppery spices. Taste is initially like a traditional witbier...with clove, coriander, Belgian yeast...slight banana and orange...but JP puts their twist on it with their famouse barrel aging. Lovely tart farmhouse funk and oaky, white wine characteristics come through. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, and very dry. Drinkability is very high. Overall, I feel like a broken record when I talk about Jolly Pumpkin...they can do no wrong. They have perfected the art of barrel aging.

The taste is pretty much the same, but there is a stern force of citrus peel bitterness and a slight cedar flavor added to the proceedings, spinning things a bit out of control. It just doesn't taste right to me, is all. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation (that's barely there) and a crisp finish.

You always think of wood aging as something usually done with heavier, darker beers, but it really did something special with this light wheat ale.

Flavors common to your average wit are present, coriander and hints of orange peel, yet where it usually bores me, here it is combined expertly with a mild sour funk and earthy yeastyness not generally found in the style. Fruity, wheaty body. Great combination of ideas here. Artisan indeed. Finishes nice and dry on the palate, delicate yet with substance.

It's not a bad beer for warm summer evenings, but you can easily find better beers for cheaper.

4.23,8.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a light yellow-orange-tangerine colour ... let's call it "white gold". Two finger white foamy head with sheet lacing and gentle carbonation. Smell is classic witbier, which for me always conjures up lavender and spice, in this case orange peel, coriander, lemon zest. The predomiant taste impression is of a sweet, not sour, tartness with low bitterness and a yeast aftertaste. There is a sour fruit presence with good balance that goes down very well, not too acidic. I found this very pleasant and refreshing, the Jolly Pumpkin brewers from "Dexter" Michigan have come up with another "killer" brew, worth going out of your way to get some of this.","ThatWineGuy","Mar 02, 2009"

A problem I have with this style in a large bottle is that you don't get the "real deal" until you get to the bottom, so you miss "part of the show" if you are drinking it by yourself, especially. In this case, enough yeast character was present enough (though not in the appearance) that it didn't improve it much (though did change it a bit). I can appreciate sour/funky brews, but it was a bit too much for this style, for me, with just not quite enough else "going on" to really love this one.

It tasted more like lemon juice than anything else. The mouthfeel was nice--a good carbonation, but slightly watery. Not a very drinkable beer, as I had trouble finishing the one I had.

Not quite as tart as a lambic, but a geuezeish flavor with a nice crisp tart bite. A very faint apple lick on the finish as well. Some wood is detectable with a barnyard type of brettano dry lambic tart funk. As I drink more I realize this flavor is actually quite evident in this brew. Maybe even disguises some of the white ale characterisitics. Very interesting. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but I do like the crispness of it. Drinkaibility is good, but for the style the tartness does detract from it a bit.

Tart oak barrel aging really brings about some cider notes, not the overly sweetened versions but those drier in nature. Flavor brings out perfume like layers of coriander with other possible spices, citrus tartness with bitter pith notes come through. Bready wild yeast notes play their role so nicely adding to the ever growing complexity of Jolly Pumpkin beers, artisan ales at their finest. Dry soothing finish with the spices really leaving a coating on the palate.

Nose has a rich bread dough aroma, aromatic spices, coriander, cloves and a nice orange peel hint, to accompany the crispness. Start is sweet with grain and spices, a bit of tartness at the back, top is light to medium. Finish has a prickly acidity, sweet with a touchy of hop spiciness, quite dry aftertaste lingers long, a fine representative to the style.","Gusler","Oct 14, 2007"

Pours a cool, golden, somewhat murky color, with a nice head that accumulates rapidly, and holds up very well. Sediment can also be seen accumulating toward the bottom of the glass. Aroma has something so familiar in it, but I cannot quite put my finger on it... perhaps the slight funk of hard boiled eggs. It definitely has a certain stink to it, but in a very good way. Other aromas I smelled included vinegar, sour cherries, and lemon. Taste is full of tart lemon flavors, and a bit of green apple. It finishes somewhat on the dry side in a way that is similar to the way a gueze leaves you. Mouthfeel is light, with good dose of carbonation to liven things up a bit. Very easy to drink as well if you are in to other funky wild ales. What a beer! I will be getting this beer again for sure. Probably the most interesting example of this style I have tasted.","jamie2dope","Sep 10, 2007"

Pretty much the perfect wit for me, at least commercially available. If i tried to brew this myself, I'd probably add a little candi sugar to punch up the ABV about 1.5% while still keeping the body light. But the fact is I really love this one.

Strong coriander aromas with secondary notes of marjoram (thanks to my spice drawer for picking that one out!), lemon, and a bit of oat. Spritzy and light in the mouth, with a moderate amount of lactic sourness. The herbal character is stronger in the mouth, as are the oats. Focused and clean finishing citrus finish. I was hoping for a bit more of that slick oaty body and a bit less coriander on the nose, but it's still a pretty good wit.","fisherman34","Mar 27, 2007"

It's light bodied and zesty in the mouth with a very fine-bubbled, effervescent, natural carbonation from bottle conditioning The flavor is oaky and dry upfront, followed by a spritz of orange/lemon and a touch of ginger-like spice. Coriander becomes apparent in the finish. Tart, refreshing, dry. It has a low bitterness to it, but it's still very dry in the finish, no doubt in great part to the oak-aging. Delicate.

Seems a little creamy and doughy, like a powdered-sugar doughnut, or those small round lemon cookies in a box. Backed up by the more sharp aroma.

Almost more of a "tripel" kind of aroma than witbier, but quite good nonetheless. This interpretation of witbier is quite dry and more tart than most. And the orange and corriander and sweetness are less prevalent. Leathery tart lemon qualities preside. As well as earthy and musty yeastiness. Herbal hops add a bit of character.

A moderate base of barley malt gives a bready, yeasty, and a light grain flavor. Spices of corriander and curraco play on the toung. High carbonation gives a creamy texture. Less thin than expected.

Medium white head holds for a bit but ultimately reduces to nearly nothing. Actually, a little more carbonation might be alright. Aroma is notable of the spices. I'm getting a good amount of coriander in the smell, less orange peel or citric qualites. There's a nice fruity flavor in there as well as a bit of cider. Taste has a lot of complexity. Spices are reduced to simply being spices, which I like. Nice thick creamy body for a wit holds a sweet malt like flavor followed by a drying yeasty precense. Light acidity is there but the finish is really dry and lingers. Orange is weak and so is lemon in comparison to other wits. I like that really. The oak again really adds body and depth to this beer, I think. Really well done, seems more artisinal than some of the authentic artisinal beers.

Long lived white bubbly head was rather unexpected, yet still appreciated. Aromas of ginger, herbs and spices were noted, as were notes of apple cider and fruits. The taste was initally kind of bland, and actually quite dissapointing. Then this brew really opens up well, around the 2nd glass from the 750ml bottle; flavors of tangerine and citrus are most presents, then a bread/yeast like flavor rears it's head. Herbs and spices are also noted, and the entire time the brew was in my mouth, the carbonation added to the crispness of the flavors. Finshed slighly malty, with a smooth bitterness.

Firm ginger roots, fresh ginseng, mellow coriander and a touch of lemon and vanilla combine into the most gracious offering. The closest one I can think of would be hitachinos, but more subtle and elegant. Like a spice mousse, fluffy. Unfortunately, the flavor doesnt quite hold up though its still far better than most contenders in the style. It is surprisingly bitter and has a sharp sour/vinous middle with rhubarb, ginger and cranberry notes. I dont find the same coherence than in the aroma, but this may be due to the agressive carbonation, full of big bubbles, which somehow detracts a bit. Nonetheless a stunning take on a witbier, world-class and beyond aroma.","Rastacouere","Jan 14, 2005"
3.48,-10.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"i was quite excited to see this beer in the beer store after reading about jolly pumpkin in teh michigan beer guide. this is my very first experience with them. they seem highly rated, but, i'm not digging on this beer all too much. it's good, but i'm not going rush out ot make sure i have another stowed away.","trancefishy","Dec 16, 2004"
3.7,-5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a deep golden honey color. Very nice head formation that slinks away as you drink. Didn't notice exceptional lacing, but it was there. Spicy flavor with hints of lemon and pineapple. Very malty, reminded me of a nice belgian dubbel. Noticed a lot of sediment in the bottle, most likely due to the barrel aging. Overall, Jolly Pumpkin is doing some good things with beer and should be applauded for it.","ahking","Dec 02, 2004"
3.65,-6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Imaginative name and bottle. I liked this mellow wheat beer, but only as a share of a one-time bottle. Carbonation on tongue, with lemon and bitterness in there. Corriander, ginger and spices moderated by malt dose. Thanks to Wohlfs for shlepping to Doug Shoemaker's super tasting.","Sammy","Nov 30, 2004"

4.15,6.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Cheers to Ron Jeffries for another fantastic beer from what I've called the Best New Brewery of 2004. A wit that doesn't try to be demure, but wears its flavors out on its sleeves, and certainly one I'll get in my future trips to Michigan (and hopefully someday around here).","beergeek279","Nov 05, 2004"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a straw yellw with a thin film of white foam. Decent carbonation, but next to no head. Aroma is fruity and very sweet with the typical Belguan aroma. Flavor is sweet and lemony with a spicy, peppery touch. Just a touch of tangy bitterness at the end, bringing a dry finish to the light bready malt. Easy drinking, great session beer.","Sixpack595","Oct 14, 2004"
4.05,3.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a light golden in color. A white pillowy head develops. Aroma is of lemons and maybe freshly mown grass with some spices. First sip reveals a orangey and lemon taste with very slight bitterness in the aftertaste. A very fine example of witbier. The only thing I mark down slightly is the mouthfeel which is so light that the beer just floats on the tongue and feels a little watery. Easy to drink. I'm glad this is in Jolly Pumpkin's arsenal.","mjohn27603","Oct 03, 2004"
4.1,5.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours out to a vibrant gold to almost orange in the glass with quite a large head. The aroma is fragrant with citrus, especially a light lemon and bread dough coming forth. The taste is good, with a light spice on the tongue that show off hints of citrus and malt that gives way to an easy finish that seems mild yet complex at the same time. This is a very, easy to to drink beer and definetely the session beer of the Jolly Pumpkin line.","proc","Sep 25, 2004"
4.47,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pungent citrus aroma -- lemon and dried orange peel. But baby powder, coriander, and a mild breadcrust smell make themselves known as well. A creamy, yeasty body houses more citrus and corriander and notes of orange candy. I've had this three times now, and while I'm confident the basic flavors and aromas have stayed constant, my overall impression keeps changing from good to spectacular to good. Wits strike me as a very temperature and mood dependant beer, and this is no exception. At times, it seems mild; at other times, it screams out to me. A well-executed beer.","marburg","Beers"
4.52,15.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This resides at one pole of the Wit spectrum : big, earthy and exotic : less "Hoegaarden" and more "St. Bernardus" if you will.","putnam","0"
