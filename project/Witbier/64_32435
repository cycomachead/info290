DFH has blended wine characteristics with beer very well in the past, but the end result here just didn't do anything for me.  Also, admittingly reflected in the rating is the pricetag.  At $15+, I could've done a lot better.","khargro2","Mar 09, 2015"

Wonderful depth of flavors, the grape juice really plays well with the predominant orange zest and spiciness of the witbier. Oak barrels are a nice touch in that it gives the beer a dry finish like a fine red wine. Enjoyable malt bill and yeast strain only adds in more complexity and depth.","OrangeMen","Dec 26, 2014"

Has a citrus, caramel aroma.  You can detect the high alcohol content as well.  Very smooth caramel tasting, ending in a citrus blend.  Alcohol content is high at the end but leaves a very mild aftertaste only.  Very good beer.  Even though it is evident, it hides the alcohol content well.","jngrizzaffi","Beers"

Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apricot, lemon zest, red grape, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, caramel, light biscuit, oak, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big apricot, lemon zest, red grape, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, caramel, light biscuit, oak, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, lemon zest, red grape, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheatm honey, caramel, light biscuit, oak, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial witbier style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 11, 2014"

Very creamy smooth medium to medium full body supported by fine soft carbonation. The palate begins exceptionally creamy, with fruit – especially grapes with light orange, then a shot of caramelly malt over light bread followed by a moderate hop accent and a hint of alcohol so moderate that it’s hard to believe that this is 10% abv. The caramel-toffee flavors from the malt provide an intriguing balance to the light wine and oak flavors. White wine, light oak, alcohol, rich malt and a light hop accent linger in the aftertaste.","pat61","Sep 05, 2014"

But closing with a semi-sweet weight, the ale remains much more of a sipping beer than a drinkable one. Mild bitterness and rosy spice gives this high gravity wheat beer a hearty prickle on the tongue as it exits.","BEERchitect","Jul 05, 2014"

The appearance was a nice reddish orange hue with a thick head head that dissipated rather quickly, The smell had a lot of blackberry and grape flavor from the pinot noir. Very subtle. The taste was full of fruit in a good way with a lot of the wine flavor coming through in the finish giving a semi-sweet lingering to it. Thought it was a nice after dinner beer, good with rich deserts.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 04, 2014"

If you are fan of Belgian style beers (especially Golden Strong or Tripels) along with some wine-like characteristics thrown in to up the ante, this will be right up your alley. Although not overwhelming, the oak barrel/stave aging is what really makes this beer special. Although DFH claims this to be a great beer for aging, I feel that all the flavors (like Burton) are most pungent and enjoyed fresh...exception being the alcohol presence of which would probably mellow after a few months.

Some yeast, but not overbearing. Delicious beer; all the same fruit flavors come though with some honey sweetness. Tastes like a fruity wit. While the grapes are evident, the specific varietal would be hard to pick out from taste alone. Feel is very good; moderate carbonation and it is slightly creamy. Good beer, another nice trip off the beaten path from DFH.","Samuel906","Sep 17, 2013"

Sweet orange fruitiness up front with some other tropical fruitiness. The sweetness is immediately offset by tart vinous character and a touch of wood. Long red wine like finish, drying oak, touch of alcohol and mildly tannic. Incredibly complex with a wide array of flavors that all all layered very well.","jtierney89","0"

The apparent ;lack of aroma lead to a surprise in the taste - wasn't expecting much. Somewhat sweet, a little thick on the mouth feel. Can taste the wine notes/grapes for sure, but some nice citrusy notes to balance it off. Sweet but not heavily so - some warmth from the alcohol. Thought this was well-balanced overall. It was a great change of pace and would probably go great with a cheese/meat plate or as a meal accompaniment. Kind of thoughtful tasting if that makes any sense - tasted it and went "hmmm" or said "interesting" several times during consumption.","LeRose","Nov 25, 2012"

The smell has some belgium yeast and a wine/grapes smell to it. The taste has wine/grape taste up front, also i get a little spice of coriander and some citrus closer to the back of the tonuge. Some dark fruits are present also.. It defently has a very complex taste on your taste buds. The mouth feel is good,very nice carobonation and is a little heavy but not to heavy though and overall i'm not a big fan of wne flavored beers, but this one is really good and i think it is at least worth trying once.","chefhatt","Oct 17, 2012"

I'd place this beer in-between the two in terms of sweetness and body. It wasn't as heavy and over-the-top as the Imperial White, but it was sweeter and richer than the Positive Contact.","Greywulfken","Jul 13, 2012"
3.37,-13.1,4,2,4,3.5,3.5,"Appearance and head retention are excellent and right for a witbeer. This bottle only aged for about a month and a half, so the fusel alcohols were still present in the smell, over shadowing some of the orange and coriander notes. Taste is sweet, slighly cloying, with fusel alcohols also present. Low frutiness and spice, probably masked by the sweetness. Overall, a good high-alcohol witbeer that should be stored for a few more months to let the fusel alcohols die down.","czieber","Jul 12, 2012"

Thinking of one of Sam's books, is this supposed to be a compromise between "he said beer, she said wine?" It really doesn't taste like a witbier, more like a Belgian strong golden ale with a lot of coriander and orange peel and some underlying grape. Maybe it would be better to just make a golden ale with pinot--one that wouldn't be overwhelmed by the coriander and orange. I think it drinks like a strange beer cocktail.","Beerenauslese","Apr 24, 2012"

Aroma of grape, faint wheat and an odd component I can't place, maybe the Pinot Noir; odd aroma. Unusual taste; malt in the front, quickly developing sweet wine aspects. A hint of citrus and grape on the finish, with cardamom. There is a wood or tannin component, probably from the Pinot. A very different flavor and odd for a witbier. Worth revisiting for a complete change.","LiquidAmber","Mar 26, 2012"

The nose has aromas of golden raisins & alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick & creamy with a slight effervensce that clears the pallette for the flavors you are about to experience. The beer has flavors of golden raisins, & champagne. This beer is excellent with a clean refreshing feeling that went well with the chilli with Mac n cheese.","angelogarcia3","Mar 21, 2012"

This pours a slightly hazy golden orangish color with a short lived white head. The smells is of grapes, oranges, belgian yeast esters, funk, coriander. The fell is medium with decent carbonation. The taste is good but different first is bitterish overipe oranges, grapes and slight pino noirish taste, alchohol, malts. Overall pretty good.","DavidST","Mar 17, 2012"

Very heady, and it took about 5 minutes to settle to a servable pour. (TJ's tap lines strike again?) Murky orange-red color, the head was tan, ample, and very creamy. Grape and orange peel on the nose, citric acid and bread. First sip was...incredible actually. Maybe it was just because of the frothiness of the head, but it was incredibly smooth and creamy almost like a milkshake. With time, this died down a bit and mellowed to the usual taste and texture exhibited by the beer. Taste follows the nose pretty much, bready, yeasty, vinous, orange peel, wheaty bite. Medium body and some bitterness in the aftertaste. Crisp and tasty, and I liked it slightly better on tap.","Rifugium","Mar 13, 2012"

This fades quickly to leave moderate lacing and a heavy ring. S - Sweet malts and spice dominate over citrus and oak notes. T - Heavy on the sweet malts with a mildly bitter middle and some citrus on the finish. More pinot on the taste than the smell. Definite oakiness to the taste as well. Syrupy mouthfeel with little carbonation. A complex smelling and tasting beer which is unlike most beers out there. Very unique.

Med-light carbonation, full body with a good feel. I certainly enjoyed this, nice mixture of spice, oak and wine flavours that seem to work well with each other.","peensteen","Sep 10, 2011"

3.95,1.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Silky smooth mouthfeel that feels creamy throughout, but finishes slightly dry. Taste is very much like it smells, with orange rind being the feature taste, and a white wine like taste behind it. A warming alcohol oversees all of it and adds to the wine qualities that this beer shows. Coriander is heavy in the aftertaste, almost throwing the beer a little out of whack as far as balance goes. Its not always that I find the description on the bottle matches exactly the way it actually tastes, and even rarer that I can pick out each facet of the beer and identify the ingredients. But pinot noir, orange peel and coriander are all easily identifiable, but each holds its own as a huge part of the overall experience. I can see wine lovers getting into this beer as a transitional beer, but beer lovers can appreciate the fruitiness and feel of this one. I like it, and am always happy to try something new from DFH.","chodinheaven","Aug 24, 2011"

The smell of this beer gives off a slightly sour aroma with a subtle sweetness as well. The taste of fermented grape give this beer a big wine like profile, the flavors are a little on the tart side and leaves you with a dry fruity aftertaste. There is also a good amount of yeasty flavors going on in there too. The mouthfeel of the beer is on the lighter side, it's moderately carbonated and maintains a good drinkability.

Overall this is a very nice brew, a little too sweet to have more then one or two, but is perfect as a sipper after dinner. the wine notes are subtle and the style i am not sure where they got that from, a sweet, citrusy and floral ale, this works","mikesgroove","Aug 01, 2011"

This is the second Pinot noir-inspired beer I have tried after Russian River's Supplication, and I have to say that I enjoyed the Supplication alot more...even though I found it a little bit over-the-top. If a brewer could come up with a wine/beer fusion somewhere between the intensity of this and Supplication it might be perfect, in my opinion. With all that being said it is really hard to think of this as a Witbier when you drink it...just enjoy it for what it is...it's own creation.","Dirte1096","Jul 21, 2011"

Also some alcohol present in the smell. Taste is slight tartness up front, followed immediately by an intense sweetness. Wine characteristics (tart dry fruit, some tannins) come through once the sweetness subsides. Some subtle bitterness on the finish.

I'd like to think this might mellow in time, but the alcohol feel is intensified by the acidity of the wood. It's too bad, like a serving method intruding too much on food.

The smell is beautifully aromatic of orange with a hint of the pinot, and the taste is subtle in both of those directions. The texture is soft on the pallet while the aftertaste is very short lived but enjoyable. Since it's 10% abv, I've got a nice buzz going while this horrible movie comes to an anticlimactic finish.

I guess what I'm trying to say is it's in between a sweet lambic and a wheat. It smells great. It tastes great as well. It tastes of sweet, dark fruits. It's kind of like orange and pomegranate. This beer is quality through and through. It drinks exceptionally smooth, like all DFH 750s. This is a great beer and very drinkable.

Lots of body, fullness, smooth and carbonated. Other than being maybe a little sweet for my palate, this is a great beer. One is about all I would want at a setting seeing it comes in a 1 pint 9.6 fluid oz (25.6 fluid ounces) and at 10% ABV.

4.21,8.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer is exciting. The appearance is slightly cloudy yet translucent with a burnt-orange/ruby hue and tan frothy head. I poured mine into a Bordeaux glass and my nostrils were immediately attacked with red grapes and kumquats. The initial sips are hot, but the sweetness of the juice helps mask the alcohol nicely. There does seem to be a little funky orange flavor going on, but the spice aspects help blend everything together. The aftertaste is mellow and your mouth salivates for another sip. I have tasted a few brews that utilize wine or grape juice, but they are never unanimous. This red and white, however, is remarkable balanced as the wine flavors are intertwined with the beer flavors. I think some aging would help round out some of the bitter notes, but overall I am quite pleased with this choice. I will definitely be enjoying this again.","SteelerChris","Jun 02, 2010"

The head dissipates quickly giving off some pleasant aromas of coriander, and a sweetness that's probably from the pinot grapes. The taste matches the scent with coriander making up the majority of the flavor, but the grapes that are used in this beer give it a pleasant sweetness that helps mask the high ABV.

There is a very lemony twang, lots of tangerine acerbicness from the orange peel, there is spiciness from the coriander, and there is a nice woody, herbal and malty presence that comes from the barrel aging. There is also a vinous quality, a bit cloying and sweet, but vinous nevertheless from the pinot noir foundations of this beer. The ABV, orange twang, and lemony citrus cut through the syrupy consistency to create quite a brew. This beer is maximally complex and worth seeking out. The ABV is well hidden and there is only a slight pineapple boozy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a touch liqueur like. L'Chaim.","albern","May 04, 2010"

3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Shared a magnum of this with a group of friends. This bottle has been sitting in my cellar for over two years. Decanted into white wine glasses. Really interesting color - a golden-reddish. Nice foamy head that mostly disappears. Very strong aromas of the orange peel, coriander, and a sweet red wine. Like a fruiter white ale. Huge taste of the coriander. Little bit of citrus. Finishes smoothly, but with a lot of red wine tannens. Almost a little too bitter. Fairly light bodied, with still a good effervescence. Overall interesting to drink. A lot going on, if a little unbalanced.","ndekke39","May 03, 2010"
4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice hazy reddish amber with a parchment head that is made up of fine bubbles and has great retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet, sharp and spicy with plenty of coriander. Very pleasant and understated with just a bit of wine like aroma. The taste is very Belgian. Nice spicy yeast, very balanced between honey and grape sweetness and a nice dry character. You can definitely taste the wheat in there as well as the pinot juice, but where is the wood? Seems to suffer from a common issue with DFH beers as it is a bit too sweet. The more this beer warms the more the pinot comes out. The mouthfeel is medium and quite effervescent. The finish is a tad sweet, but overall quite nice. This beer also hides its strength quite well. Fairly drinkable, but a bit hot to have more than this large format bottle. This would be a great beer to have with food.","zoso1967","Apr 29, 2010"

The taste explodes with orange, apricot, caramel, and sweet malt. The pinot noir is hard to distinguish, but it is difinetly a very complex beer showing a different side every time you taste it.

It's unique yet simple--they type of juxtaposition Dogfish Head brewmasters have mastered. There's nothing more than what it says it is, but it's quite good...and noone else does it. The mouthfeel, again akin to most other DFH productions, is strong and is sweet. Well-carbonated, the odd infusions swirl together. Knowing what time could do--or how a taste from the barrels at Rehoboth Beach might be--are factors that detract from my fresh-sip satisfaction.

Little to no head when poured and is gone very quickly. It takes a few sips to get to, but the pinot noir undertones filter very nicely from the initial orange and citrusy coriander into the stronger oak aged portion. At 10% it is by no means their (DFH's) strongest beer, but I feel that the beer works very well. I think that this fits well into the breweries limited releases catalog and I plan on enjoying it again.","madtrixter787","Oct 14, 2009"

Strong and noticeable fruit tones mix with a mild alcohol presence. Odd wine mixture that slightly reminds me of something along the St. Lamvinus line, but not quite that in the long run. So we have the fruity and earthy mix here with a nice full carbonation and smooth liquid touch. Overall this is a very interesting beer to say the least.","Anthony1","Oct 01, 2009"

A vigorous pour into a tulip created a very thin, quickly evaporating head, with no head at all left after a few moments. Quite a bit in suspension here, a nice orange hue. The nose is no where near as winey as I was expecting (maybe hoping for), I get some orange, some sweet malt. Orange dominates the initial taste but a little bit of light spice catches up with some malt as well, a much more pronounced wine like finish than there was in the nose, the alcohol if pleasant at 10%abv. A smooth, light mouthfeel with very little carbonation. Not bad by any means but probably my least favorite DFH beer so far. I will probably give this one another shot in a couple of months.","GrittyMug345","Sep 22, 2009"

The aroma has belgian yeast, soft malt, sweet tart cherry, vanilla and an overall spiciness. The flavor is sweet malt and cherry upfront and accompanied by belgian yeast, malt, oak, alcohol and spice. It finishes dry and tasty.

Reminiscent of sangria with more spice. Lively mouthfeel, sharp at times, crisp finish. Taste is very different from what I expected in a wit. Lots of corriander, orange peel, cherries, grapes, and the ever-present pinot noir. Pleasant oaked flavor. Again, this was more along the lines of a sangria in terms of the fruit/wine flavor. Borderline frutiness in terms of this shifting into a wine spritzer. Drinkablility was difficult to gauge.

The beer has a small, sweet smell with a variety of spice notes (that I can't very well distinguish). The taste is quite delicious; a strong sweet presence that appears to come largely from the high alcohol content of this beer. However, the alcohol has no bite and the beer itself has a very smooth taste that finishes a bit syrupy, again mostly due to the alcohol.

I wasn't to thrilled until I tasted it. Very nice and tastes very different than the smell. The wit aspect is shining up front followed by the beautiful addition of Pinot Noir grapes.

Doesn't taste cheap though as there is a pleasant blend of some grape and figs and oak from red wine, yet maintains a mild sweet and fluffiness along w/ some spices to perk it up from the wit.

The orange and corriander play a nice complement on this one. The beer is well balanced. The only thing I was disappointed about is IMO the brew is overcarbonated.

Wine-like grape juice in it adds even more complexity with a bit of noble hop additions. I like it, it all works together well. Only complaints I have is that it is a tad undercarbonated and DFH could bump up the specialty malts to lower the heavy alcohol presence.

The taste is slightly bitter and also very fruity. It has a sugary syrup flavor to it, which is both good and bad in this beer.

The head was khaki colored, one-finger thick, displayed retention as a collar and left average lacing. The aroma was quite fruity, pears, citrus and a touch apples that were harder to pick up over the alcohol. The flavors were quite enjoyable in my opinion, notably fruity and full of Belgian yeast. I tasted caramel malt, lots of orange, tangerine and maybe tangelo citrus, the pinot noir grapes, caramel malt and as it warmed up the alcohol began to muscle its way through. But for 10% I considered the booze generally well-hidden and the beer well-balanced. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/full and the carbonation good for the style (though to call it a witbier is to bend the rules of style a bit).

It pours a nice red-orange with frothy white head. The aroma is rich and hints at the citrus and coriander, essentially it just gives a hint at what's to come in the taste. The taste is really interesting with the citrus playing nicely with the red wine juice. Mouthfeel isn't amazing but it's still good, slightly above the moderate area but def not heavy. Very drinkable for all the reasons listed above. It could possibly become heavy or tiresome if you were, say, attempting to drink the entire bottle at once, alone, but even then it's still good. What's really great is that it has these interesting and sweet flavors in it, but it maintains itself as a witbier. It doesn't begin to tread into fruit beer territory which, considering the fruity flavors and addition of the red wine element, is very pleasing and a bit impressive I thought.

Nice coriander and peel flavor in here and alot of wheaty fruitiness. Excellent level of enjoyable sweetness throughout. Very full bodied taste that leaves little to be desired. Mouthfeel is just about the perfect viscosity here. And drinkability is great for the style with a shocking 10% abv.

Before I dared to partake I had to hold the mug up to the light and admire the vigor with which the foam-bound bubbles agitated the sediment. Pretty fucking cool. At first gulp I tasted a malty, effervescent dryness with a slight tang that reminded me of barleywine. As the ale warmed I could taste cloves, bubblegum, and later, a coriander character which lingered on the palate along with some alcohol. I waited for the oak but it never came.

I'd happily try it again and or serve it to friends that enjoy wine to help expand their horizons.","barleywinebrewer","Apr 22, 2008"

I find Dogfish Head to produce two kinds of beers: exceptional beers and keeping within the style, and over the top beers that reach too far from the target. Typically the over-the-top brews involve fruits. This one breaks the stereotypes as it is a bit left of Witbier with it's high ABV, but it ain't over the top either. A great non-traditional that I'll definitely revisit.","FleeVT","Apr 16, 2008"

A honey syrupy feel is noticeable on the mouth. The hint of pinot grapes peaks out its head twords the end of the palate. Overall this is a relaxing, nicely complex brew that is worth sipping and contemplating. Dark fruit notes hide the alchol well. But it does warm the belly.

Some floaters. The aroma was a mixture of typical wit blended with the oaky vanilla smell from the oak barrels. Also could faintly smell the pinot. I tend not to like the oak aged beers and this one followed that trend. I liked the underlying beer but the oak aging was distracting to me. With that said, of the oak aged ones I've had lately this one comes in at the head of the pack. Only recommend if you like oak aged stuff. (One and done)","TexIndy","Mar 22, 2008"

There's some definite particulate in there (on my second glass at any rate), which you would think would settle but instead remains suspended throughout. Yeasty aroma mixed with grape. The taste reminds me of some other orange influenced brews I have had, though the 10% is far less evident than those other higher alcohol varieties. This is probably because the coriander and spiciness are not as foremost, but instead is balanced by a grapey sweetness. Finishes very dry, with just a touch of oak lingering on the palate.","weasbri","Mar 21, 2008"

Didn't really notice the pinot noir in the nose, which was a bit disappointing, as that it was a favorite of mine back when I drank more wine (and before Sideways ruined it, but I digress).

Initial flavor is balanced between sweet fruit, oak, and spice. Flavor ends dry and the pinot noir really comes out and dominates here and on the aftertaste. Medium body, some light lacing, light to moderate carbonation, and alcohol was defiantly noticed, kind of wine like in that sense.

After the first sip there is lacing on the glass . Boozy flavor with some bitterness . Second glass with the bottle warmed up the brew is a chore to drink .

I could almost taste the yeast I think they used in Chateu Jaihu in the aftertaste, which was probably the high light of this brew. If I didn't drop 15 bucks on it I would have just done a drain pour. I had a hard time WANTing to finish it, and none of my friends were up to drink it either. Just wasn't that exciting to me.

Smooth malt begins and is quickly blanketed by a dry, sweet vinous character riding to the end and capitalized by a hefty oak barrel effervescent. Coriander, used moderately, does well to pull some of this chaos together. As it warms citrusy wit plays out more along with toffee notes. Its 11 abv is pretty tamed making this damn drinkable.

Can't identify much else other than alcohol and yeast. First sip somewhat reminds me of the Horny Devil, but obviously with the addition of red wine character. Very interesting. The alcohol is up front, as is the coriander. The mouthfeel is soft and massaging on the tongue. The minimal bite from the carbonation doesn't really show up until you swallow.

Aroma was appealing as well, with fruity grape notes and a hint of oak melding well with the malt. Fairly mellow, little evident alcohol, mild vanilla, and a bit crackery. The flavour was quite fruity, mostly grape/vinous in character with some (straw)berry sweetness. Bitterness was low, leaving it on the sweet side, but made somewhat of an impression towards the end. The wood makes its appearance at the mid-point - you definitely get the oakiness - but it tastes a little out of place at first, with a bit of a harsh quality that fortunately disappeared after a few sips. The finish was quite warm, full of berries and oak that lingered ligthly on the palate. Slightly sticky texture with fine, creamy carbonation. Overall, a very interesting beer. The alcohol was hidden well and the balance was pretty good for a big experimental beer.

It smells like cherries, cranberries, coriander and a bit of red wine. The aroma is on the weak side. It tastes the same as it smells, however there's also oak and vanilla in the taste, along with a bit of earth and spicyness. Mouthfeel is light but has a good bit of carbonation.

The flavor was light citrus, coriander, caramel malt, wine, along with some light warming alchol showing up at the finish. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation.

In the mouth it really just comes across as a strong, creamy wit. The pinot is starting to come through but right now it is just so subtle. The oak is there to give a little bit of structure and ground things, but it's not so strong. I pulled it out of the fridge about 40 min ago and it is still to cold so things are a bit dull.

Palate is initially sweet, with a faceoff between the competing elements of sweet grapes and tart witbier.

Can't wait to give this one a taste. First smell that hits me is bananas for sure, pretty much what I expceted with a wheat-type beer. Definitely can sense a bit of white wine odor to it, but not as alcohol-y as I had expected in the odor for 10%. Good coriander odor is present as well. Taste is quite similar to the smell with a strong banana/yeast flavor coming at ya. Definite dark fruit flavoring biting the tounge as well; cherries, plum, grapes. The wine flavoring to me wasn't as present in the flavor as it was in the smell, but you can definitely detect it. The aftertaste is almost apple-like and a bit dry, but very pleasing. High carbonation on this one, but doesn't take away from the brew whatsoever. If I didn't know the abv was 10% before I drank it, I would assume it to be a 6-7% so I'm obviously giving the drinkability of this one a high score. If you like beer, try it.

Subtle banana, very light cloves and esters typical of a wheat in the background. Maybe not necesssarily spicy as a wit, but a nice aroma. Something more citruslike and akin to orange is the strongest flavor noticeable at first, which I did not expect given its color.

Aromas and flavor collide hand in hand, very smooth and the hops balance very well with the fruity flavor. Easy drinking beer. This is a great accomplishment with wine and beer flavors. Awesome summer beer. Tastes almost like a lambic, minus the sour.","dwarvenspirits","Apr 09, 2007"
3.5,-9.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is equally as intriguing, dry wheat and Belgian pale malt notes with dry oak and grape must. The Witte character is hard to pin down, I think i can taste the subtle nuances of orange peel and spice, but maybe it's just cuz i know they're in there. Certain characteristics of the Pinot noir clash with the bitter hop finish, and the alcohol is HOT. It tastes better with food, the Pinot Noir nuances are more obvious and certain aspects of the Wittebier base come through as it warms. I honestly think this will improve dramatically with a little cellar time. I was expecting something akin to Allagash Interlude based on the ingredient and brewing profile, but this is certainly it's own unique creation. As usual, DFH has managed to twist and manipulate styles to create something utterly new and different...hats off to imaginative/artisitic brewing!","AlexJ","Beers"
4.18,7.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750ml bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Murky red-orange body with a thin off-white head. Aroma is fruity - grapefruit, orange, grape, along with caramel in the background. Citrus and grape dominate the flavor too, with just a hint of caramel malt. No real spice taste, though a hint of alcohol is also present. Fairly well-ballanced and drinkable. A tasty, pleasant brew, with s nice complexity that doesn't hurt the drinkability. Great beer.","MrHurmateeowish","0"

The smell is lighter than expected with brandy/like wine aroma,wheat,dark fruit,and a "bisquity" aroma. The taste has a biting bitter hop flavor with some grape/brandy,yeast,alcohol,citrus ,and cherries. The taste isn't bad,but more subdued than I expected. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing very well and hides the alcohol well. For a high gravity beer, this goes down pretty easy. Another winner from Dogfish Head.","jmz62565","Apr 05, 2007"

In both the aroma and taste, you can definitely detect some of it's Belgian characteristics. Overall, I found this to be an extremely enjoyable brew that is highly recommended.

It had very little head and poured a nice clear ale brown. The smell was rather complex. I'm dealing with allergies so I couldn't pick out anything specific but I could tell this would going to be something special. The taste was not at all over powering. It was both sweet and spicy. This is definitely worth picking up.","edmedina","Mar 23, 2007"

4.32,11.3,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Once again, DFH does not let me down. I was very afraid that this would be overly sweet (like the Fort), but I am very pleased with the balance and finesse this has. Incredibly well made, and very, very enjoyable. And for only $11.49 for a 750 mL, I think it's a pretty good deal as well. I'll be buying a few more.... some to drink, and some to cellar. I don't think this NEEDS to age at all, but I'd be curious to see what happens after a few years. Recommended... if you see it, pick it up. The complexity alone blows me away. I can't even imagine how many test batches it took to get this right.","phisig137","Mar 20, 2007"
4.1,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Served by the bartender from 750-ml bottle into a red wine glass. Pours out a brilliant, clear red. Some white head, but fades quickly & didn't leave a lace. Aroma shows the wit spicing of coriander and orange, but also hints at the fruitiness & has something vaguely "sharp" as well that I can't quite place. Flavor is strange... another "queer bird" from DFH. Fruit (pinot noir juice) and wood (oak) definitely show up more in the flavor, but ends up mixing into a complex whole. Alcohol also shows in the flavor, not in an objectionable way (warming perhaps, but the beer seems "lighter" than the 10% abv shown on the bottle ... at least at first, it does seem to build on you). Huge yeastiness as well. Vaguely more like a Tripel perhaps in that respect (reminds me of the Chimay yeast). Definitely interesting... but also confusing. Other than punting with a cheese-course matching, I'm honestly not sure what to DO with this beer. Maybe as you would use a frozen sorbet as a palate cleanser?","jsbrendle","Mar 19, 2007"
4.7,21.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours ruby red in color, obviously from the Pinot Noir barrel ageing. Aroma is wine and fruit. Good mouth feel, effervescent and full. Flavor is boozy and full, but you can taste the corriander in the background. This a typical Dogfish Head offering unique and well done, yet not fitting exactly into a BJCP catagory, i.e. comparing this one to Hoegaarden, Sterkens White or Wittekerke is not fair. Definitely not apples to apples, more like apples to tangelos in this case.","bodegajohn","Mar 19, 2007"

3.73,-3.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Dogfish Head Red and White were a truly exceptional beer. The beer pours out an orange body with a slight off-white head that faded into a thin covering across the top. Bringing the beer to the nose there is a huge whiff of Belgian Wit yeast and coming up behind it were orange peels and coriander with a faint aroma of Pinot Noire. The taste, like the nose, was dominated by the Belgian Wit yeast. However, unlike the nose the taste of Pinot Noire was much more present. Very little fusel alcohol notes were present in both the nose and taste. For being such a high gravity beer it was extremely light on the palate with an extremely refreshing mouth feel. The drinkability of this beer was extremely high. It went down smooth and left me wanting more. My girlfriend and I shared a bottle of this with brunch, some steak and eggs and hash browns. This beer was strong enough to hold up to the steak but also delicate enough not to over power the eggs. It was a wonderful beer to drink and to pair.","cproioi","0"

4.05,4.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The wheat and yeast are first in the flavor, but gets better with yeast, peppar, coriander and the lightest of orange zest.

Drinkability is pretty high, which becomes problematic when my head started getting warm. If it were slightly lower, this would be drinkable as all get out.","Umbra","Mar 14, 2007"

4.85,25,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I have to say to start that I am a huge fan of Pinot Noir in addition to being a beer lover. This brew was fantastic for its lovely evocation of that wine as well as having great beer flavors all its own. In my mind it is the perfect marrriage of beer and wine. The beer pours a beautiful pinkish orange with a reasonable head that fades to a rim that sticks around and leaves some slight lacing. The aroma is of bubblegum, fresh pressed grapes, banana, and cinnamon. There is also a whiff of clove and earth. Slightly sweet on the nose. The flavor is great- more bubblegum at the start followed by a nice parade of pinot noir flavors: cherries, earth, some oak, and a vague grapiness. There are also nice notes of spice- coriander, cinnamon, and clove. A touch of vanilla from the oak just before the finish, and a final hit of sweet cherries right at the end. Absolutely fantastic. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and with the perfect heft for the flavors. Even with the high abv this beer is extraordinarily drinkable, I wanted more and more and the alcohol was not discernable at all. The Wit base is the perfect marriage with the Pinot Noir flavors. A stunner.","Georgiabeer","Mar 11, 2007"

The smell was less powerful than I would have liked, but still a very good fruity aroma. There is a hint of the alcohol in the aroma and some in the taste as well, but that is somewhat to be expected in a 10% ABV beer. The flavor is an excellent blend of a wit and pinot noir. There is a light fruity belgian funk in there and then the smoothness of a wine blends it together. It is very light bodied and very drinkable.","drseamus","Mar 09, 2007"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I have been eagerly anticipating this release as a fan of most things dogfish head and pinot noir. The addition of pinot noir juice has lended a hint of burgundy to the color. A relatively slow first pour yielded a small, white head that was somewhat fizzy and faded without much lacing. A bit of the grape comes through in the nose, as well as the coriander, and wheat. The mouthfeel is full with a slight creamy slickness that has just a touch of prickle on the tongue from the carbonation. The grapes add depth and a subtle sweetness that compliments the sourness of the wheat malts. The alcohol content is well hidden which makes for a higher drinkablity considering its 10% abv. The barrel aging no doubt helps smooth out some of the rougher edges and helps conceal its true potency.","TripelJ","Feb 26, 2007"

3.03,-21.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Red tinged amber that pours with a pink cast and initially looked liked some sort of pink sparkling wine or soda. A cushiony, frothy head of dirty white foam with a brush of pink rests atop. Slow moving small bubbled carbonation columns laze upwards. The head steadily settles itself, coming to rest at a thin skim, and leaving webby lace only at the top. Orange rind and sweet red wine aromas are fruity and reminiscent of sangria. There is a bit of spiciness beneath the fruit, but overall it has a fairly sweet nose. Coriander is strong initially, but the red wine sweetness comes on strong and overwhelms this. Medium-full body with just a bit of fine carbonation, there is a heaviness to the mouthfeel and it lacks the crispness and snap of a wit. Finishing with the slimmest drying red wine edge before the sweetness again washes through. The 10% alcohol is fairly well hidden, which is a plus. Red and White at times reminded me of Midas Touch and Chateau Jiahu. This seems to be trying to be too many things without doing any of them particularly well. One $12 bottle was more than enough and in actuality, a single glass would have been plenty.","hopsaplenty","Beers"
4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the DFH brewpub in Rehoboth. The beer poured a solid golden color with a slight white head that didn't last long but gave way to a floating island in the middle of the glass and some solid lacing. The aroma was sort of like your typically Belgian style Wit as it had touches of wheat and corriander and other fruit notes but it also had a bit of a wine touch to it. The taste is more of the same. The wheat and spices come to the surface quickly and are enjoyable but you also get a red white taste which makes sense as this brew was aged in Pinot Noir barrels for about 2 months. It is evident that they brewed this with freshly ground corriander and about 60 tangelos as you get the spice and the citrus as you would expect in a Wit but is appear to be fresher. This wine taste is not at all overwhelming but compliments the other tastes going on and the folks at DFH did a nice job of hiding the high ABV. Although it turns it at 12%, you can't really sense it that much, just a touch at the back end as you get teh wine flavors. Very interesting brew and worth a try if you are able to grab a glass or growler of it before it is all gone.","ggaughan","0"
