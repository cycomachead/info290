The orange was subdued and coriander just didn't get it, was in the smell but wasn't in the taste, which probably helped this beer to my taste.

Medium bodied, with a smooth oily feel down the middle, and light tangy, slightly subdued carbonation on the edges.Wheat malt and light lemon flavors up front with tangy pepper flavors through the middle turning yeasty toward the end.

3.69,0.3,3.75,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its aroma. Here things are kept in check with warmth of spice and heartiness of grain. These are lost a bit through the flavor, however, with things lightening up a touch too much, becoming diluted and lost amongst the wetness of the wheatiness. The spice base laid down through the aromatics is thus lost and depreciated. Otherwise, for a light sipper of a Wit, this guy goes back smooth, ultimately making it easy to appreciate. While this is not our new favorite Victory offering, it does the style well, and will sit against most of its competitors.","TheBrewo","Nov 21, 2013"

3.97,7.9,3,4,4,3.75,4.25,"Date tasted: July 5, 2013... Glassware: Rare Vos shaker... Occasion: camp week #1 in the books, and reviewing an old friend....Appearance: pale straw haze; thin off-white head that stills quickly; appears easy-drinking but not overly attractive ... Aroma: tart citric bouquet, with orange and lemon scents softly against some pepper--more intriguing combination than the average summer wit... Palate: a soft yet firm mouthfeel, smooth at the teeth and lacking all (any?) presence at the throat--mega-refreshing, as recalled... Taste: a bit of pepper sneaks in, but far and away a doughy, orange twist that easily sifts down the throat; not complex, but enough profile to compel... Overall: An old friend indeed--this was the first beer I found that fit the easy-drinking summer plan once out of college; surprised I had not reviewed it yet, I had to go back to it; for better (or worse), a case of this could vanish in a mere day or two; better than the sum of its parts....","dacrza1","Jul 06, 2013"

3.78,2.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden straw color with a small fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, grass, earth, and yeast spices. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of lemon, grass, pepper, tangy wheat, orange zest, earth, bread, clove, and yeast spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, wheat, pepper, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a short bit. Good amount of flavor, with nice balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a nice crisp and lightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is very nice witbier. Good amount of flavor and nice balance; and extremely easy to drink. Very pleasant and enjoyable.","superspak","Jul 08, 2012"

A slight nutmeg and cinnamon highlight throughout, as well. The aftertaste is roasted and clove spiced, with a smooth, creamy finish.

The first flavor to come over was the light grain, and a touch of yeast, some banana poking around in there as well, with a sparkling quality to it. Nice touch of bitter grapes toward the finish, giving that little bit of a hoppy touch to dry out the finish and get you ready for another sip.

Cloudy straw yellow color, opaque without density, some bubbles inside visible. Unassuming nose of clove, ginger spice, banana, golden raisin scents, more mandarin orange than any other citrus, the bready element more doughy than baked, light does of carob too. Fairly full-bodied, "it's got back" and moves at a slow pace. The carbonation might be too low and hence a contributing factor in its relative lack of crispness. The clove spice pulls back, the orange to lemon citrus not really taking its place. Maybe a suggestion of apricot, peach, banana fruit.

Mostly what is nice to see is all the floaty flakes often in suspension in the lower quarter of the drink. Some lacing but it usually settles down. Aromas were strong but not too appetizing. Pine smells were particularly noticeable with really zesty lemon. It felt both natural but artificial at the same time: really invigorating aromas that also smelled like a Lysol spray. Still give props for its uniqueness in my book. Taste was much better than what the aromas would tell: very refreshing and strong in citrus, bready flavors. Somewhat watery but perfect for the summer heat. Like I said, so far for the summer, this must be one of the more refreshing beers I have had. Strong flavors, but wicked light, refreshing body.

The taste is a bit disappointing, but not bad. It is fairly subdued, but there is spice, rind, lemon citrus, some berry like sweetness, and then there is a sourish, slightly off taste in the finish.

Smell on draught was very *average*, while smell from the bottle seemed a bit richer, and thus, a little more impressive. Taste on draught is very good with loads of spice and delicious flavours.

Unlike a Hoegaarden though, which can be a bit too grainy and murky at times for the superheat the season is giving us right now, this may be unfiltered but delivers a much cleaner presentation from start to finish. Scents of citrus and bananas, a nice fizziness on the tongue with a nice balance of lemon peel and light bitter hops to keep it from being too sweet (the downfall of many an American made wheat style for me) and general earthiness. The aftertaste reminds me of something a little spicy and is that blueberries I'm thinking as well too? This is a damn good twist on the summer wheat styles. Completely thirst quenching and refreshing especially on a doing yard work in a scorcher of a day like today.

Light wheat malt and a hint of subtle aromatic spice on the nose . . . peppery. Tangy and zesty on the first sip, with coriander being the dominant (albeit not overpowering) spice. Lightly tangy-sour,and with just enough crystal malt sweetness to counterbalance the yeast and spice. Although this was served rather cold, it tends to open up nicely as it warms. Lighter in body and mouthfeel, Whirlwind seems almost watery at first, but the body, too, tends to develop as this warms. Ample carbonation, and combined with the zesty, spicey, yeasty aspects makes this a cleansing and almost brisk drink. Lemony (lemon rind?) aftertaste lingers and augments the light, aromatic hops used, definitely not very bitter. Insanely drinkable . . .

Basically it looks alright. Nose is wheat, some yeast, and fruitiness; mostly lemon and a little apricot. Taste is strong and interesting for a witbier. In no particular order: breadiness, citrus (lemon mainly), good amount of yeast and coriander. Feel is medium to thin body, solid carbonation. Worst part of this one is definitely the look; after about 10 seconds, there's basically no head; it seems like this might be a bottling issue.

Sweet extra pale malt and tannic wheat upfront, followed by a pleasently acidic clovey yeast bite and weak orange peel and coriander spice. Aftertaste of light herbal hops and spice that balance the flavor and dry the tounge. Thin, almost watery body and lively carbonation make this a bit too crisp even for the style.

Mouthfeel is not milky nor heavy, bit of tang from the carbonation. Despite defying typical rules, this one wins.

It presents a grassy aroma, full of coriander and citrus. Spice, lemon, orange peel, and esters. The taste is fresh and citric. Theres plenty of coriander and citrus in the aroma, along with a mildly tart acidity. Its not very complex, however, and (despite just a little twang) lacks real wheat flavor. Its slightly sweet in the foretaste, which provides a nice balance to the tartness. Theres a little yeast flavor in the brew as well. The beer gets a little bitter near the finish.

The taste is understated, in being faintly lemony and grassy. The after taste is wet and there is a minor residue of some sort which sits on the tongue. Definitely not worthy of a $9.99 price tag.

I am not keen on witbier with too much coriander, the scent is a bit stronger on coriander than the taste was, but it was still quite wheaty and zesty. I thought the taste and aftertaste were the standout qualites of this beer. Sweet, refreshing wheat malt is what dominates the taste, but there are many undertones from coriander and nutmeg flavors, to orange and lemon zest. The spice in this beer creates a zing in your mouth, like mint would for instance, as you have one or two. That mouthfeel, along with the light bodied character make for a very drinkable beer.

On the palate, a light coriander-spicy pale maltiness released a nice and zippy lemony-citric zesty aspect before entering a lighly bitter weak finish.

3.94,7.1,3,4,4,4,4,"Largely clear, golden in hue, I can see each individual yeast particle suspended in this Wit. The head was white in color and modest in size, at its height the head managed to be about a half finer in height. Retention was fair as is it faded away in a moment, a soapy collar was all that remained. Subsequent lacing was minimal, spotty, and it didnt cling well. The appearance is basically what is to be expected, albeit a bit dull. The nose is bright, plenty lively with a funky yeasty twang; plus aromas of citrus, mildly spicy, and peaches. Wheat. Simplistic. There is a good amount of potency to get the few individual aromas across. I like the nose. It is inviting. The palate is as bright as the nose indicated. There is a good amount of flash, spicy, cloves, coriander, and musty yeast flavors. Citrus flavors like lemon notes too. Mild acidity. The foundation is a solid amount of wheat. Like the nose, the palate is simplistic, even for a Wit. This is a good summertime beer. Refreshing. Spicy aftertaste. There is something about it that is decisively American, maybe because the spicing reminds me of, get this, Blue Moon! Im serious. Nor am I complaining. In Whirlwind the wheat/malt backbone really steals the show. Medium in body, moderate carbonation that is lively and playful, overall the mouthfeel is pleasant. I found this to be very drinkable. I bought a six-pack in Burnsville, MN and I waited to my last bottle to review it. This is a solid beer from the folks at Victory. Try one.","bditty187","Jul 30, 2004"

Secondary are rounded, ripe banana esters and judicious, herbally sweet coriander. Clean and welcoming aromawise. The flavor profile exhibits a fine balance of citric acidity and grainy, bready wheat sweetness. Spicing is agreeably understated, with coriander melding seemlessly with the static clove phenol undertone. Orange peel provides more pithy bitterness rather than flavor, and serves to offset residual sweetness lending a quenching near dryness. Lightly bodied overall, but with a lightly viscous, proteinaceous mouthfeel from the wheat and perhaps oats used in the grist. Banana esters augment as the beer warms adding additional depth. Finishes with hints of spiced lemon juice and honeyish malt. A spot on witbier, without a single rough edge or flaw. Superbly drinkable and soft on the palate.

There's the wheaty flavor from the hefe mixed with the zippy spices of the Belgian. Different, and it comes off well. Crisply-carbonated and slides down the gullet quite easily.

4.68,27.2,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"This was my first Victory beer and I can definitely say I wasn't disappointed. The beer pours a hazy yellow color out of the bottle and the bottom of the bottle will usually have a good deal of yeast. The smell isn't that exciting but you can note a bit of a citrusy smell as well as a smell of spice. The taste of this beer, at least to me, is very hard to beat. It is a bit sour and full of citrus flavor. It is not a heavy beer and feels great on the tongue with its ample carbonation. As far as drinkability is concerned, this beer is one of the most drinkable you will find. I bought a six-pack a few weeks ago(along with a lot of other beers) and this time that I went back to my old reliable liquor store, I bought myself a whole case of it, something that I rarely do because I usually like to mix it up. Maybe one day I'll get sick of it but I highly doubt it. I can't wait to have these when summer comes along.","wsouloa","Apr 12, 2004"

3.57,-3,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"It looks like apple juice -- no head to speak of, and a cloudy yellowish pear-like color. There was a small amount of sediment in the bottle. The aroma had a biting spiciness reminiscent of some Belgians. The taste was very smooth and refreshing with almost a clove spice flavor and sweet fruit in the aftertaste. Very little carbonation -- I don't know if that was the result of the age, but it added to the drinkability -- it went down like a fruit juice, which also describes the mouthfeel. This would be great while grilling on a hot afternoon.","jtfest","Mar 10, 2004"

Thick white head that dissipated pretty darn quick, not much lacing left when it was gone. The smell was spicy, perhaps cloves. The taste was spicy as well, again I got a clove taste right away. Some fruitiness in the background, a bit citrus like. Mouthfeel was a bit this for my taste. Too little body for me, but defiantly crisp. Perhaps if it wasn't 6 degrees outside right now I'd appreciate the light body and crispness more. Drinkability was good. As I said, I'm going to drink this again when it warms up and I'm not in winter stout drinking mode. All in all, an excellent Wit though.","Ieatlambfries","Jan 10, 2004"

The taste was fairly sour, with the citrus flavor strong but with wheat and some hints of spices (coriander), and very low hop presence. The mouthfeel was tart and lemony with medium-light body and low carbonation feel. The aftertaste was tangy and spicy.

The interesting thing about this wit is the spice kick. Can you say pepper? What a wonderful surprise to taste a sharp twang of pepper in a wit. While I am not sure they use pepper precisely, it is nice to see someone breaking away from the style barriers a bit to offer our palates something different from this great style. It had a steady citrus aroma coupled with a cloudy appearance. Overall this is a beer I will take a drive to find.","andyj","Jul 22, 2003"

The beer pours a deep golden color, with a very thin fluffy white head. Seems to have less haze/ clouds than other witbiers, but definitely unfiltered. Spice is present, but not oeverwhelming. I tasted good floral notes, and a prescence of orange, complexed by some spice. I assume it to be the typical corriander/clove mix, but it felt restrained somehow. Some sweetness, perhaps vanilla also. Because of the complexity, I found it to be incredibly drinkable, and very refreshing. A nice switch from say hoegaarden, if only for its unique spice character. A great summer beer.","99bottles","Jul 10, 2003"

To me the beer seemed to lean way too heavy on the ORANGE! I mean, that's the main thing I tasted here-like orange juice was added. I think I prefer a drier, more subtle example such as Gray's witbier or, of course, Holy Moses. I bet this would be spectacular however, with an order of teryaki sea bass!!

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Appears a golden hazy hue with a vibrant white head not as pale of golden as a Hoegaarden, but this is a fairly authentic Belgian style wit using a Belgian yeast. The head doesn't billow as thickly as I was anticipating, but I am still impressed with the vibrant white head with fairly large bubbles. Aroma is very lucious with spices and cloves flowing through it, and the characteristic sharp sweetness from the malted wheat complement eachother very well lightly hopped to produce a favorable representation of the witbier. Taste is slightly acidic good carbonation cause the tingling mouthfeel from this lighter bodied beer, but the first thing that comes through is a rush of bitter sweetness balance with a faint trace of the yeast characteristics of citrus, cloves, and other spices in there. Very nice drinkable summer beer for any wheat beer lover like myself, yes I could drink quite a few of these. I still prefer Holy Moses, Allagash White, Hoegaarden, and Wittekerke over this, but it's still a great representation of a classic style by an amazing brewery like Victory.","WVbeergeek","Jun 14, 2003"

The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy and feels like a much stronger, malty beer, but still refreshes. This beer is delicious and well balanced, making it a great summer refresher/session beer.

The color was a deep golden yellow, with cloudiness that prevents seeing through the glass. The head is bright white and lingers for a little while. The aroma is strong, reminiscent of a belgian ale. The flavor attacks the senses immediately, and delivers that big round taste that envelops the tongue. There are hints of citrus and pine, no hop to speak of.

The flavor is lightly sweet with a soft citrusy fruitiness (even some dark fruitiness... light cherry?) and gentle clovey spiciness.

On its own terms, it's a bit soapy, with some good spices, but the Belgian yeast overshadows everything -- it's off balance and a little unpleasant. As a scholarly exercise, it's a successful American interpretation of a tricky Belgian style, but as a beer-drinking experience it's merely so-so.","Thrasher","Jul 12, 2002"
4.42,20.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer's a hazy glowing yellow color.  Particles are in suspension.  Very nice nose.  Nice wheat malt aroma with spices like cinamon, nutmeg and corriander mixed in.  The taste is excellent.  I am starting to enjoy good wits more and more.  Great wheat base.  A little bit of a Belgian-like tanginess.  Refreshing.  Spiced to perfection.  Very good Wit.","Bighuge","Jul 03, 2002"

3.75,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Most weiss beers I have had are very similar, but this one tasted very unique. Looks like the others, cloudy and straw colored, but this one bit me. It had a yeasty spiciness that at first I didnt quite expect, but as it warmed and I had a few more sips it tasted quite good. A unique interpretation and definitely worth trying if you like these kind of beers.","IrishRedRock","Jun 19, 2002"

3.97,7.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pale yellow body with slight carbonation. Hazy, unfiltered. White head of rapidly popping bubbles. Lemons and spice in the nose. Maybe some orange peel. Taste is very refreshing and light.  Enough body that it is not beer flavored water. Spices enhance but do not dominate. Not a style I've had much experience with, but I think this is one of the top summer quenchers available. Victory continues to show it is one of the great breweries.","RonfromJersey","Jun 07, 2002"
3.4,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"This witbier from Victory is not the best I have had, but it isn't too bad.  The aroma and inital taste are a little more hoppy than any other wits I have experienced.  Color is nice golden, head is fluffy white and mottled.  Kind of sloppy finish.","beernut7","May 12, 2002"
4.33,17.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"pale orange color with much cloudyness.  fruity nose.  White head and lace.  Sparklely feel with citrus yeast notes. Excellent summer beer.  A keg of this will be on order for my brothers pre-wedding event the last weekend of june. Quality ..mmmm","frank4sail","May 02, 2002"
4.4,19.6,4,4,5,4,4,"A solid representation of the Belgian wit style. Victory is one of the top US breweries and this is another excellent brew from Downingtown.","John","Oct 18, 2001"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: $8.99 a 6-pak in Massachusetts, and worth every damn penny. Whirlwind Witbier could hands-down become one of my favourite "gotta quench my monster thirst" beers. A prime example of a Belgian-style Witbier in all respects.","Todd","Aug 02, 2001"
