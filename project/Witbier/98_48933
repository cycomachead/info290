Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, herbal, wheat, bread, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbontion and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4.8%. Overall this is a nice and pleasant witbier. Good balance and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2014"

Like the smooth combo of malt and wheat, and the cirtusy falvor was natural tasting and not overly sweet. Not a beer I'd buy on it's own, but I'll certainly enjoy the other one from the Harpoon Winter variety pack.","stella77artois","Oct 20, 2013"

Bread-like hops and some decent light zest sort of made this a passable brew, but seems to be masking the fact that there are so many more beers in this category that are totally better. Not bad though for its price. Cheers!","DMXLOX22","Feb 25, 2013"

Aromas of banana, cloves, nutmeg, and roasty/toasty characters all over the nose in a good, flavorful blend. The beer's palate is an interesting blend, as well, with the spices and banana characteristics, but also a quick highlight of citrus throughout. The roasted quality comes through once again, with an effervescent ending to the profile. The afteraste is surprisingly light despite the flavorful nose and palate, with only a hint of the fruit and spice blending. The beer was fairly light bodied, but smooth and creamy throughout.

Nose reveals coriander and a trace of lemon zest, but for the most part is somewhat subdued. Taste is fairly bland - while the nose is fairly mild, the flavor profile is somewhat watery and only expresses a suggestion of the citrus and coriander identified in the nose.

The flavors were good; orange and hints of citrus peel, coriander, a touch of lemon and pale malt. Like the aroma it was balanced but it was also crisp and dry. The mouthfeel was watery but smooth, the body light and the carbonation light/medium.

Very easy to drink, flavorful enough, this certainly doesnt need any added fruit as the label suggests. Good beer, although not my favorite in style, it becomes a bit sticky and cottony on the tongue after a couple of sips. With that said, this is a welcomed addition to the Harpoon line up and dare i say this is the best ive had in the UFO series.","ATPete","Jun 17, 2009"

3.78,5,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"This beer is exactly what I have come to expect from Harpoon's regular offerings(excluding the Leviathan and 100 Barrel series). A good quality beer that I can really enjoy. A lot of breweries are good at making big beers but just can't make multiple session brews to enjoy on a normal basis. Thumbs up Harpoon.","Crack1Open","Jun 10, 2009"
3.63,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a 1/2" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has your standard wheat and pilsner malt scent along with an above average orange peel and coriander aroma. It's not as crisp and refreshing as some. Maybe, it has a bit more pilsner malt. The taste is decent as well. It's a good drinking beer, but it falls a bit flat in it's complexity. It's not as spiced as it should be and the yeast doesn't provide enough esters for that really tart fruit taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a solid witbier, but I feel it could be better. All in all, a worthy brew.","WesWes","Jun 10, 2009"

3.31,-8.1,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Pours a light straw color, hazy and cloudy. Neat little puffy head but not a lot in the way of lacing. Smell was very disappointing, not much at all save a sniff of pale wheat. Taste... pedestrian. Like a standard, average wit. Big emphasis on wheaty flavours, a hint of spicing, but not much. It was pretty light, and light in body, which leads to a bit of watteryness. Decent drinkability though, it should for something so light. Not much to say here. Mediocre all the way through, and you can do better.","damienblack","May 21, 2009"
3.48,-3.3,3,2.5,4,3,4,"Appropriately orange in color and hazy in appearance. Poured a frothy white head that quickly disappeared. Subtle aroma, taste is light with obvious orange flavor. Highly carbonated makes it feel a bit thin. A good summer brew to enjoy on a hot day. Considering the lower ABV, can spend an evening drinking this beer.","BetterDarker","May 20, 2009"

3.8,5.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"While Harpoon's version is missing the tart plum fruitiness seen in most Witbiers it makes up for that with balance and drinkability which is what the style is about.","Jason","May 13, 2009"
4.22,17.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The feel is fizzy like a bubbly champagne (more champagne!). Creamy and not at all watery. An unusual wit, not unlike Brian Regan. A terrific American version of the style.","williamherbert","May 13, 2009"

3.75,4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Picked up a sixer at Walsh's in Brighton Center for about $10. Poured into UFO hefe glasses with a wedge of orange. Cloudy yellow color. Huge white head that lasted for some time. Smell was a nice bouquet of spices (coriander, orange peel). Taste was very refreshing but subtle. Great flavors of a witbier, but with a hint of citrus. The added orange aided that flavor. The flavor, though, was a bit on the muted side. It was there, but not very pronounced. Very smooth on the palate, and easy to drink. A good session beer, or end of the night brew. I can't help but drink this beer and just think it's just a version of the UFO that was tweaked a bit. Either way, if it's going to be the new Harpoon brew, then I welcome it. At least it's better than the UFO Raspberry.","morebeergood","Apr 20, 2009"
3.5,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste is not pronounced one way or another. It is a light witbier, very refreshing and drinkable. It has the coriander, lemon, citrus, some rind flavors, some light floral bouquets, some dryness in the finish. The beer is a tad too light for me, but it is a very respectable representation of the style.","albern","Apr 17, 2009"

4.1,13.9,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Drinkability- Harpoon should have much success with this one. Clearly the best of the UFO beers by a mile, and I would suspect not just good to the typical BeerAdvocate. I'll go out on a limb and say that this will soon be Harpoon's best selling beer.","lpayette","Apr 03, 2009"
