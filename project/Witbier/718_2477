Back when Pierre Cellis ran Hoegaarden that was the go to wit but after Interbrew gobbled it up and instituted high gravity maching to reduce costs, Wittekerke was the best Belgian wit left standing. It has the light straw color and a thin, white, fairly quickly dissipating head. Orange peel and spice aromas greet the nose. It has a refreshing, citrusy, spicy taste perfect for drinking with a pot of mussels and pomme frites. It is light yet full flavored.","pat61","Mar 11, 2015"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength.

Lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, bread, floral, grass, herbal, coriander, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a very short bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with decent robustness and a very dry finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, banana, grain, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, plantain, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This one really left me desiring more from it. The flavor was really quite muted and didn’t have a lot going on in it. For the style it was average to say the least, but definitely nothing more than that. At least the aroma was a little nicer to bring it up above an average brew of the style. Worth trying for a craft brew n00b, but if you enjoy a good Wit, I would look elsewhere personally.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"

Taste is extremely fruity up front with some grain flavors on the finish. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel.

The nose comprises wheat (bordering on sourdough), coriander, lemon zest, and a pinch or so of cardamom. The taste leans more heavily on the spicy side, with the cardamom and coriander meshing with newcomer black pepper. The lemon zest is still there, but a tad more subdued and enveloped by a slightly more assertive bit of wheat. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish.

Wheat malt and lemon zest aromas with a hint of pepper in the background. Medium bodied with assertive, refreshing carbonation. Creamy smooth feel with a clean finish. Wheat and biscuit flavors up front with lemony citrus bitterness in the middle and a light peppery undertone throughout. Finishes pretty clean and is very refreshing.

It's the lightest wit I've seen, it's the lightest wit I'm smelled, it's the lightest wit I've tasted. It doesn't feature the normal flavors or aromas. This is far below average in my opinion.

Pours smooth with little head, leaving a consistent, thin foam ring around the top of the beer as it's being consumed. Cloudy and straw-colored (as it should be), this drinks very well cold and fairly ok warm, but hits its peak served very cold. Most white beers often require additional citrus slices to balance out the beer and "make" it what it should be (think Shocktop or Blue Moon), but the blend of ingredients with this beer doesn't need any doctoring. It goes down smooth with a solid citrus and coriander taste, offering a consistent little bite in the back corners of the tongue and mouth. The carbonation is mild enough to drink heartily, but the taste and mouth feel want you to slow down and savor such a quality drink. This is a great beer for those with a domestic palate (Bud, Coors, etc) who are searching for a foreign, high quality white zesty beer made the RIGHT way.

Chunks of sediment hover in the beer, eventually fall, only to rise at each sip. Chunks so big you can tell what spice it is (orange peel, clove, corriander). Soapy, round, orange peel and watermelon essence. Sweet, fresh and corriander exploding from this white beer. Fruity tropical and round aromas that entice. Honey is pretty present. Incredible corriader and fruity yeast flavours. Strong sweet and fruity palate. Soft and slightly acidic-tart citrus that gives it a good tang. Slightly lifeless but ever so flavourful. Hoppy, soapy and floral hops gives it a nice oily texture that glides very. Body is rather thick feeling and heavvy due to sweetness. Delicious, refreshing and fruity.

I do have to comment that, while I am warming up to can beer in general, in this case the can makes it hard to get a good Belgian pour of your beer, so it ends coming out sloppy so that you break the tension in the beer and it will flow. The first two I poured, I tried to pour too slowly, so it ran back the side of the beer and spilled all over the place.

There is also a hint of fruity yeast. Taste begins with a fruity yeasty taste that leads to a mild sourness. The finish is quite yeasty.

The taste was very refreshing. I could sit and drink these nonstop. The taste was wheaty, almost to the point where it was more like a hefe weizen than a witbier.

The feel is light with fizzy carbonation; finishes with a grainy sweetness. Drinks real easy, good for drinking in the sun. The bier is just about average in all aspects. No real bold wit flavors, they seem to sit in the background. The grainy flavor seems to be forefront, while making the beer easy to drink, it seems to stray from the style.

Lemon again most present, lots of carbonation in the mouth breaks up a good deal of the denser malt, barley and oat flavors. Starts off dry and gets sweeter as you swallow. Some mixed Asian spices.

The head maintained a nice lacey retention & the overall appearance lept its cloudy color. The aroma offered up a floral lemon zest with a hint of spice. The flavor was an upliftingly sweet, but not too syrupy, lemon wheat-malt with a bit of hops in a bubbly carbonation that stuck around. As with all wheats, no additional lemon wedge need apply (you don't add a potato wedge to a stout, do you?).

Wittekerke does look pretty damn good with it's murky lemon/lime appearance. The beer posses a minimal head that disapates within a few minutes. The lace is bubbly and beautiful. I really did enjoy this beer. It has a perky lemon smell, I swear I can smell a bit of cotton candy. It has a mild bite, subdued lemon taste complemented with flavors of wheat, grapefruit and manderin orange. The mouthfeel is so subdued, calm, inviting, crisp and refreshing. Aftertaste is clean and fresh. The aftertase flows through the nasal cavity and stimulates your face, skin and eyes to make your nerves feel somewhat alive. This Belgian Wit was a treat, the ABV is very tolerable. I can take my time with this 6 pack and enjoy every moment.","TCadillac","Jul 16, 2008"

Citric notes real noticeable in the smell, especially lemon and some orange peel, combined with some spices and faint clove. A little sharp but the citric notes and spices blend together for a good taste with a medium body that flows smoothly over the tongue and with a little sweetness from some malts and the wheat.

On the palate, quite bitter first off, then acidic, before a mellow biscuity malt quality comes through. The only thing that really does not work is the finish, which contains some unpleasant, vinyl-and-mint flavors. Overall, this isn't a bad witbier, and it's entirely likely that someone without the same sensitivity to whatever is coming out in the finish would enjoy it significantly more than I did.

3.28,-8.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured a light and hazy lemon yellow with a massive head of white pillowy foam. It had one of those head of foams that made me stop pouring half way because it would have overflowed the glass if I didn't. The head of foam had really good retention that left behind a white pillowy film, white foamy rings along the edge of the beer, and a few streaks of white sticky lace around the glass. The aroma started off heavy with dry pepper and with some juicy fruits and a slice of lemon behind it. After it really warms up, the dry pepper aroma dissipates and then is replaced by citrus fruits and a small drop of honey in the background. I'm not too sure what happened to the juicy fruits or the slice of lemon after the dry pepper dissipated. They must have left with the dry pepper. The taste was on the thin side with just a few small tastes of pepper, dry citrus fruits, a slice lemon, a few hops, and with a little dab of yeast to finish it off. There wasn't much going on in the taste. It was average at best. The mouthfeel was really light, not too watery, and with a minuscule aftertaste of grains, citrus fruits, and a little yeast. So this is where a few malted grains emerge. They weren't in the initial taste, so I guess the aftertaste called them up and told them to stop their hiding. I thought it was pretty much a slightly above average Belgian Witbier. I thought the can was a nice touch. This beer in a can would make a nice choice if you're going out on a hot summer day picnic.","AltBock","Apr 27, 2007"

I'm a creature of habit, and I have a plethora of glasses, plus, I'm a stickler for appropriate glassware when consuming beer. So it was poured it in an authentic Wittekerke glass, which is frosted. So when I say it pours a clouded lemon yellow, the frosting of the glass may have impaired this. I'd assume it's clouded, having this beer a handful of times beforehand. It has a pretty nice creamy white cap on it. Citrus and spicy aromas with a bit of dusty yeast notes to it. Tastes pretty good, clean and lightly wheaty, with coriander in the background. My friend described a flavor of "hot dog water" in it, like the water left behind after boiling hot dogs. I'm mildly amused. I notice more of a grainy, clovey, citric aspect to the whole thing. But then, hearing somebody describe a beer absurdly sometimes tickles the funny bone. Very refreshing and thirst-quenching; well-carbonated. From what I understand, this beer used to be called Bavik White and was renamed after a popular sitcom in Belgium which translates into "White Church". Hence the white church on the top of the taphandle when I've seen this on draught. Anyhow, this beer is very drinkable, especially this fresh; and on a hot, humid night such as this.","crookedhalo","Sep 04, 2004"

The spices are subdued compared to other versions, and even the citrus flavors are not as pronounced. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is good as well. Wow, this beer really reminds me of Belgium, where I often drink canned beers outside in wonderful surroundings.

A white head topped off the beer; it was a little less than a finger in height at the apex on a normal pour. Head retention was poor as it quickly faded to a skimpy cap and then a foamy collar. There was no subsequent lacing. It looks like a Wit, just typical. The nose is musty, yeasty, wheaty, and vaguely fruity (mostly lemons). I only get a suggestion of spice; this aspect is too soft for a Wit, IMO. The potency is small. Yes, the nose is inviting but Im not really impressed. Really, what is this beer saying? Speak clearly please. Anyway. It is time to drink. The palate is the most favorable aspect of this beer. This is a very tasty Wit. I love the spiciness; it is perfect, not too strong but very wide and lingering. Once the lemon flavors and bright acidity kicks in, wow. There is a hint of orange zest too, plus suggestions of cloves, vanilla, musky wheat, soft bread, and earthy-sweetness. At the back are some vague fruitiness and more sweetness, sugary. Tasty. The aftertaste is musky, spicy, and wheaty. Refreshing. The mouthfeel is good; the carbonation is low and soft, medium in body. Silky smooth! This beer is amazingly drinkable but not straight out of the can. I experimented with drinking the beer without a glass. It was awful, very harsh and alcoholic. You see, always use a glass! Still, I wish the canned version were available locally as it would be a godsend during these hot Nebraska summers. I purchased a six-pack in Minneapolis, out of pure curiosity. It was a sound buy. It is very refreshing, low on complexities but tasty enough to care. Well worth trying and, yes, there are much better Wits on the market.","bditty187","Jul 21, 2004"

3.23,-9.8,3.5,3,3,3,4,"11.2 oz can. Poured a cloudy pale yellow, with very little head. There is some fine lacing left on the glass. Aroma of wheat and citrus is present. Taste is lighly tart, good carbonation, with no odd flavors, no sign of hop bitterness. Nice and smooth. I could sit and drink this all night. Of all the Wits I've had this is the best.","Indybeer","Jun 28, 2003"
3.3,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a hazy yeklow color with big blooming head,smell was very lemony and almost to sour.Like others who have reviewed this I think this lacked spiciness that Iam accustomed to with this style,way to one-dimensional.Not overly impressed with this one,there are many better out there.","oberon","Jun 04, 2003"
3.26,-8.9,4,3,3,3,4,"Pours cloudy yellow, big, white head doesn't stick around too long. Aroma is lemony, sour, some spices sneak through. Taste starts a little sour, a little sweet - banana, lemon, and some spices. Body is on the lighter side of medium A decent white, but I prefer the Hoegaarden or Allagash versions.","goz","May 14, 2003"
4.77,33.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"My first introduction to witbiers occured this summer, and I was able to sample both Hoegaarden and Wittekerke on tap. I remember at the time really enjoying the Wittekerke even more so than the Hoegaarden. However, when I came back from California I really haven't seen this beer. So, I decided to sample it again this time in a bottle. Appears a light hazy golden hue, very pale int he pour with a gleaming foamy white head. The aroma is an amazing mixture of banana, spices, and honey sweetness this is one spiced up monster of a wheat beer. Wittekerke in my opinion does everything Hoegaarden attempts and does it better. Thank heavens I have found a real white beer. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with traces of the spiced up yeasty, wheat combo the flavor is well balanced and amazingly done. Very drinkable I am sold that this is the best Belgium wit style I have had to date.","WVbeergeek","May 02, 2003"
3.48,-2.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Normally I steer clear of anything that comes in a can but this one was highly recommended. Poured super cloudy honey colored with very little head and only mild lacing. Not much of an aroma but a very smooth ale and impressive to me only because of the can factor. I didn't really taste anything metallic at all. Subtle wheat taste and even less yeast flavor. I would definately drink it again but there are so many better than this. Great in a glass restricted enviroment i.e. boating, by the pool etc.","BierReise","Apr 24, 2003"
3.97,10.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very cloudy pale yellow... almost looks like lemonade. Has a thin white head, and leaves just a bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is lemon, yeast, and a touch of cloves. Flavor is dominated by lemon, with some musty yeast notes coming through. Mouthfeel is thin and light... a very refreshing "lawnmower beer."","zerk","Apr 15, 2003"

3.45,-3.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A Belgian white in a can? A first for me. Pours a hazy pale yellow, like diluted grapefruit juice. Aroma is fresh and clean, lightly yeasty. Mouthfeel is likewise quite light, but not thin. Flavors of soft white-bread with a touch of lemon and tropical fruit in the far background. Nothing noteworthy, but quite pleasant and drinkable - sort of a Hoegaarden light. A lawnmower beer of the Belgian variety.","Brent","Mar 08, 2003"
3.4,-5,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours to a cloudy, straw color; looks a bit like grapefruit juice. It forms a white heat the quickly dissipates. The aroma is a citric zest fruitiness, but I also detected a grainy smell as well. The flavor again has fruitiness to it, somewhat lemony. It has a slightly tart finish to it. It is a definite refresher. It would be great on a hot summer day.","BeerBuilder","Feb 17, 2003"
3.3,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I feel that this was much to sweet to be a wit beer. It has some good lemon characteristics and a nice wheat taste but knid of a dull sweetness that I don't like to much. I think this pales in comparison to Hoeggarden in bottle and especialy on tap. I didn't have it with a lemon so maybee that would even out the sweetness, next time we'll give it a go.","OatmattStout","Jan 15, 2003"
3.72,3.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a pale yellow colour topped by a thick white head that settles down rather easily. The aroma was dominated by wheat. Taste is quite satisfying and it tastes fine at any time of the day. Look out for this beer. Worth tasting it","ipogios","Dec 03, 2002"
4.22,17.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Soft texture, wonderful drinkability, some graininess, but still creamy, luxurious. I could drink this by the pitcher on a hot summer day! Tastes great anytime, though.","feloniousmonk","Dec 03, 2002"
3.57,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Notes: I’d prefer this brew bottle-conditioned though the canned version is not bad at all and is a perfect switch if in a situation that restricts you to canned beverages only. All in all a decent white ale.","Jason","Nov 22, 2002"
4.2,17.3,4,4,4,4,5,"The cloudy yellow body is topped by a firm and bright white head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma offers a somewhat sweet and fruity, lightly earthy and floral malt with a gentle clove note. The body is light, but with an extremely fine, natural carbonation that makes it oh-so-supple in the mouth. Like velvet! The flavor offers very lightly tangy notes of sugary lemon and orange peel along with a bright & fresh but restrained clove spiciness . Wonderfull. The finish is short, and lightly sweet, with a very gentle reminder of the flavor that was just had, beckoning you to have another sip. A very delicate beer. What I like about this beer is that the spice is so clear - although it comes at the expense of a limited yeast, and to some extent, malt character. One of my thoughts at first tasting this was "Budweiser with spices" but it's far more complicated than that. Still, this is very refreshing and quite enjoyable with some interesting flavors.","NeroFiddled","Oct 09, 2002"
3.98,11.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Off-white/yellow color and simple, fine beaded head. Clear, bright aromas of honey and late-summer flowers: goldenrod, grasses etc. Supple, light texture carries subtle notes of fresh lemon juice, orange peel and acorn. Wonderfully uncomplicated. Creamy. Drink with ceviche, grilled bass or tuna salad. A great crossover opportunity for future True Beer drinkers as well as a great cleansing salve for tired Beer Advocate palates.","putnam","Oct 06, 2002"
3.53,-1.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,"Hazy banana color, close to the pineapple Lifesaver candy in color. Decent bright white sugary head of 1/2 an inch. Slight lemon aroma, not particularly yeasty. Very understated flavor, just a very smooth ester sense with a trace of vanilla and a very, very sweetened lemon finish (like a lemon bar cookie)...Wits are tough for me, some leave me unsettled in the swallow and some are excellent. There's nothing offensive in this beer but little else to challenge the tongue, either. So, to me, mediocre flavor but as drinkable as a frosty root beer at a carnival.","ADR","Oct 01, 2002"
3.95,10.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Bright lemony aroma springs out when poured. Active, quickly dissipating head is perfectly white and the body is an extremely pale yellow that takes on a faint greenish tint at times. Nice balance of citrus and spices. Flavor tastes on more of the orange peel than lemon and coriander is noticeable but not too strong. Actually quite enjoyable and not bland at all.","aracauna","Sep 11, 2002"
3.33,-7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Cloudy orange-yellow. Fluffy white head that held long enough. Light floral tones on the nose. Very light and smooth, tanginess on the finish. The wheat really didn't shine through like I'd expect. Quite drinkable. I'll definatly revisit this one, as I have a gut feeling I missed something.","packetknife","Sep 08, 2002"
