It slips by the nose detection system & even evades the taste buds but gets all the way to the back palate then thumbs it's nose over the shoulder...like a gatecrasher that's the other side of the barricade. Merely worth a shrug & a wait & see to find what may be added to the party. IMO, not much. In fact it may be adding to a cloying aftertaste that detracts from the usual refreshment I get from straight up heffes. Going rougue, in this case, got a bit off the reservation...but perhaps that's their point. In conclusion, this did grow on me...but then again so does moss, where the sun don't shine.","seedyone","Aug 10, 2014"

The name is misleading; this is not a hefeweizen. Why not make it a true hefe by using the weizen yeast they use for the Roguenbier Rye they brew? It's beyond me. Regardless, this is a solid, drinkable wheat beer. It's currently categorized as a witbier, and based on flavor profile, I'd say that's about right. I'd consider this a once a year purchase.","TheSixthRing","Apr 08, 2013"

Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, coriander, ginger, clove, wheat, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; fairly weak on strength as expected. Taste of pear, lemon, apple, coriander, ginger, clove, wheat, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness; with lingering notes of pear, lemon, apple, coriander, ginger, clove, wheat, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, spice, and fruity ester flavors; with a good amount of flavor that is not watery at all; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good witbier style. Good balance of malt, spice, and fruity ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

I'm not surprised that the ginger flavour in this is more Canada Dry compared to Albino Pythons Jamaican ginger beer. The Rogue is much more subtle, with coriander and doughy malt holding the ginger to supporting role. Mild lemony tang. Very mild hop bitterness in the finish; spicy and grassy hop flavour. I wouldn't call it bland, but I would like it a little bit bolder. Almost medium bodied with fine, spritzy carbonation. Feels crisp and refreshing.

I recall liking it being served this way from the last time I had it on tap at the brewpub. First impressions were a very euro-esque artisan beer smell, somewhat like old cheese. I mean this in a good way. The taste was that of somewhat bitter citrus with more of this old cheese euro-pils type flavor. Very light mouthfeel, can easily down a few bombers in a sitting, especially at the relatively low ABV. The second glass from my 22oz was without lime and was more pleasant. Whether this was due to the lack of lime, the unfiltered yeast on the bottom of the bottle or the fact that I had loosened up over the first 12 oz, I wont know until next time. However second half of the bottle was lacking much of the bitterness of the first. Not a great beer, but many Hefes are fairly one-sided to begin with.

It's fairly clear for a unfiltered, without much foam. It's OK though because it does not try to be a German, sort of its own brew.

Sweet malts (caramelly and bready) merge with a citrus spiciness for a rich aroma with earthiness and a light muskiness. Tastes a little too tilted to the barley malty sweet end, not allowing the wheat or the finess of the Wit body and flavor to shine. The corriander, ginger, and citrus flavor balances the sweetness nicely, if not boldly. The body is medium and firm, a little heavier than I want in a Wit. Finishes sweet and spicy. Less clean or crisp as what I would have liked, but good beer nevertheless, just not for a Wit.","BEERchitect","Apr 17, 2006"

Taste is hops up front, floral and sharp, with a noticable spiciness, including an unusual but pleasant ginger note which gets stronger as the beer warms. Citrus and other spices are present in the background. Mouthfeel is crisp and fresh, making it a very nice choice on a pleasant spring day, and drinkability is pretty good.

Aroma has a strong maltiness and a hint of hops and not much else - reminds more more of some of the hoppier American wheats, not a witbier. The flavor, too, is more pale-ale like with a good solid malty base, good hop flavor, and a complimentary bitterness at the end. Overall this is a good beer, not terribly complex but firm with its flavors. The spices claimed on the bottle are not very evident, but maybe they are playing into the perception of hop flavor which is not a bad thing at all. I think the phrase "half a weizen" means a lot - this is kind of part pale ale, part witbier, part weizen, and 100% original Rogue. I think if you want a witbier, don't get this; if you want a weizen, don't get it; but if you just want a good beer, its a valid choice.","KroMagnon","Nov 25, 2005"

Smells, hmm... Nice. Malts, coriander, citrus, wheat, and ginger. Taste is very well balanced. Primarily sweet, but their is a spiciness and hop bitterness that coincides with it. Not much coriander, just enough to taste. Reminds me a bit of Canada Dry. Must be the ginger. Mouthfeel is hard to describe. Smooth and fizzy is the best I can come up with. Drinkable? Oh yeah.

Head retention was lousy as it rapidly faded to a soapy cap. Also, there was no subsequent lacing. Still, I cant hate on this beer because I really dig the color! The nose is very citrusy. Before I checked the bottle (to look at the ingredient list) I took a more thoughtful sniff. Orange peel, lemon zest, both are very soft. Then comes a dash of ginger. Underneath is a kiss of coriander and a malty smell. The nose is like a juicy Wit. The bouquet is not musty though; it is very crisp and lively. This seems to be a departure from a proper white ale (as expected, it is by Rogue after all). I checked the bottle, I would have figured there were some Pac/WC hops in use. It is okay to be wrong! The potency is moderate but the aromas have no trouble convincing me to take a sip. I do, with glee. Man, this is tasty. This is a beautifully constructed beer. It is amazingly playful. I love the ginger; it adds some complexity and a modest bite. The coriander is second fiddle but it plays its role it the scheme of things. There are some definite white ale qualities even though there are only minor wheat flavors. I just cant get past the soft citrus flavors; there is orange peel galore with just a suggestion of lemon. There is some sweetness too, kind of in the middle but more towards the end. This aspect doesnt linger long as the hops curb any further development. The Saaz hops end the taste, pleasant spicy qualities. I found this very refreshing. I thought Soba was Rogues best summer quaffer, not anymore! Medium in body, the carbonation has some energy and this helps create a very pleasant mouthfeel. All in all, I really enjoyed this beer. For a wheat beer of sorts it really brings a lot of different flavors to the table. In many ways it is better than a decent Hefeweizen and/or a Wit. Blasphemy I know. I can think of dozens of foods to pair this beer with. I wish I had more. I wish I could get more, easily. I bought my bomber in Burnsville, MN for $4.39.

An interesting turn on the Hefe style, making it a bit less chewy, a bit more drinkable, nice result.","ppoitras","Jun 13, 2004"
4.11,15.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"For Rogue, this beer was refreshingly un-hoppy. The slight Saaz tones blended with a nice wheatiness spiced by the ginger. I could easily drink myself out of house and home, one of the most drinkable beers i've ever come across.","GreenWBush","Jun 03, 2004"

3.78,6.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"the foundation is basically good quality, nice and steady, and the ginger is an interesting additional element. But at the same time, the seasoning takes it close to being a bit of a novelty. It's something you want to tastem but in my case, having done so, I won't soon have another. Sure, it is indeed drinkable, if ginger is your thing, but that makes it a niche beer. No, it's not bad, and may be fundamentally good, but this one's enough for me.","Foxman","May 10, 2004"
4.75,33.4,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"This brew is a cloudy golden color, with a large white foam head on top. Sheets of lace are left behind. The scent is a nice floral scent, with some berry elements as well. The taste has wheat, beeries, floral hops, citrus elements, and ginger as well. A wonderfully complex beer based on wheat characteristics. Delicious and brilliant.","Tballz420","May 08, 2004"
3.94,10.7,4.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Half-A-Weizen was served from the typical Rogue 22 oz. silkscreened bottle. In a hefe glass, the beer was a lovely nectar-like orange juice yellow-orange color, and was topped by thick, rough, and sticky white head. The nose was fairly low key, presenting a wheaty huskiness and notes of coriander and light orangey citrus. On the palate, a delicious creamy wheaty malt body opened up with pronounced spicy coriander, which led into a crisper orange-lemon tinged transition into a wheaty-citric, moderately bittered finish that left lingering coriander and very light spicy ginger essence...very nice. The body was richly creamy and wonderfully robust, yet retained a nice level of underlying crispness. Half-A-Weizen was a tasty, lightly spicy wheat beer that made for an enjoyable and satisfying early evening drink. If you like a good american wheat and coriander spiced beers, you will enjoy this one.","HiroProtagonist","May 01, 2004"

Aroma: A sharp citrus tint with herbal spices in the background, peppery Saaz hops, bready characteristic Pac Man yeast strain, and ginger what a nice mixture creative brewing here. Taste: The ginger is upfront very nice brew seems like something that could be on the Morimoto lineup, soft bready yeast with the Saaz bite in the finish. It contains a cream overall tone with hints of clove and coriander not a true hefeweizen but awesome mix of flavors. Mouthfeel: This is where this beer emulates a weizen the most has a creamy fluffier mouthfeel, with spritzier carbonation medium to light in body. Drinkability: The spices start to wear on the palate but overall an excellently refreshing mad scientist gone homebrewer creation.","WVbeergeek","Feb 22, 2004"

3.41,-4.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Quick summary: A good brew overall, but I was really hoping it would be something to write home about given Rogue's recommendations and accolades, and it isnt really. Pours a mighty fine dirty blonde with fair head retention and the typical cloudiness of a hefe. Smell is much like any other beer and not that distinguishable. Taste at first seems to be of a typical hefe minus feeling much particles on your tongue, but evolves with the ginger that was added. I am not entirely sure that the ginger adds to the brew however. Without it, the brew would taste fairly bland. With it, the beer tastesunusual? Not my cup of tea, but I can see why some people are attracted to it. Give it a spin, because I sure as heck cant tell you if you are going to like it.","RocketWidget","Jan 21, 2004"
4.6,29.2,4,4,5,4,5,"Nice big Belgian-style head, nice weizen coloration, and a wonderfully sweet smell.

The Half-E-Weizen pours into the glass a golden honey color that is amazingly clear (if you don't agitate it) and topped with just a bit of frothy white head. plenty of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. The half-e-roma is an intriguing blend of wheat, sweetness, and spice. Taste is similarly out-of-the-ordinary, bursting with character and spice unlike any other hefe I've tasted. Starting off it's just a bit hoppy then quite spicy, with flavors of orange, coriander, and maybe a little ginger bite coming to the fore. Then a more classic malty wheat flavor comes in towards the middle and end, finishing off with just a bit of bitterness. This brew is very refreshing and drinkable, and unfortunately quite difficult to find in my area...but worth keeping an eye out for.","mikeys01","Nov 29, 2003"
3.3,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5," It has very tingly carbonation with a light fruity flavor. It is lacking a bit, but it is still ok. The balance is pretty good, but the graininess got a little big at times. There are notes of bitterness and orange peels to add a little complexity. It is really not that interesting overall, and I would have to say that this is my least favorite Rogue so far.","ElGuapo","Nov 17, 2003"
1.99,-44.1,3.5,2,2,2,1.5,"Pours with a head that quickly fades. Tempting amounts of unfiltered yeast settle to bottom of glass, as with other wheat-type beers. Rather thin mouthfeel. Has the amber-orange color of a German wheat, but that's where the similarity ends. Initial taste is that reminding me of an amber ale, but the aftertaste is unnecessarily bitter. I shouldn't make direct comparisons with other beers by name, but this tastes likes a 50-50 mix of Bell's Amber ale and Rogue's bitter ale, which leaves the beer in a strange taste category. Rogue has an outstanding Chocolate Stout and Shakespeare Stout, but this one's bitter aftertaste ruins it for me, which is unfortunate, because I like beers with intense flavor.","Sudmissle","Oct 06, 2003"

3.8,6.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Medium yellow color, nicely hazy but not really cloudy. Generates a generous 1/2 inch head of large bubbles, but it powers down in 25 seconds or so. Slight lace in a pint glass. Dense aromas, not distinct but more of wet hay, yeast and lemon zest, almost like wet canvas. grainy texture, flavors of hot cinnamon and ginger snap sort of pop like little explosions. Nicely hopped peppery finish. Given its "half" a Weizen name, I rate this beer as unique, almost like a hopped-up Wit or something. Interesting, and a variation on the rolling and estery Hefes that get a little boring come the hot weather months.","ADR","Jul 10, 2003"

Smell is very dull but solid lemon and orange with a light wheat backing and a light note of ginger spice. Taste is a mellow mirror reflection of the smell with flavors of orange and lemon dulled down, wheat, mellow and easy with a light full balance of hops and notes of light spice of ginger and cinnamon. Full body feel, smooth, mellow, light airy drying in the finish showing up late. Very drinkable and easy. Good thing it comes in the 22oz cuz this went fast, yummy stuff.","tavernjef","Jul 01, 2003"

Not sure where the name comes from, but with every quality, this beer moves farther and farther from a hefe. Tastes good. Sour. Clean and crisp, though. Wheat aftertaste! There you go.

Flavor begins slightly sweet, then somewhat citrusy and tart, with a sharp spicy bitterness in the finish. Moutfeel is somewhat rough, with a medium body. With it's lack of phenols, and hoppy character, this is definitely an American interpretation of a hefeweizen.

The nose is sweet malt with a slight yeast tone, crisp, fresh and quite pleasant. Start is sweet and loaded with malt, the top middling, and the finish spiteful in its acidic bite, the hops stinging in their bite, dry aftertaste that is long lasting, and a fine quaffable beer.","Gusler","Feb 18, 2003"

3.35,-5.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Bottling a hefeweizen in bombers perhaps is not the best way. I have a large half-liter Paulaner hefe glass and I can't get the whole bottle in (especially with the large head) Most of the yeast had settled and stuck to the bottom so my first sips were of Half-E-Kristal Weizen. After drinking some to get some space in the glass and some bottle swirling it turned a nice cloudy gold. (Yes I know I could have agitated the bottle before opening, but I have trouble with geysers when I do that.)The aroma is nice wheat and coriander. The ginger doesn't come through as much in either the aroma or flavor. The Belgian wit half is good with the coriander adding a nice spiciness (especially coupled with the saaz hops). There's good wheatiness (although not as big as the wheat in the Widmenr Hefeweizen I had last night). Unfortunately, Pacman yeast isn't really a good yeast for a wheat beer. The lack of almost any esters unbalances this beer, keeps the beer from achieving the complexity wheat beers are capable of and makes the flavor thinner than it should.","aracauna","Jan 13, 2003"
3.97,11.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer doesn't look very carbonated and has a dull chill hazed golden appearance. Not much of a head...just a slight rimming of tan soapy head. This beer smell like a wit. Wheat and corriander dominate the nose. The taste is enjoyable. Ginger is so subtle and complimentary. There are none of the predominant "Hefe-Weizen" characteristics present, but I don't think a hefe-weizen was intended with this beer. Most closely resembles a Wit, but not totally. Body is light-medium. Mouthfeel is a little spritzy. Some lemon notes hit the palate. Refeshing, solid and unique brew. I'd like a keg of this next summer.","Bighuge","Jan 06, 2003"
