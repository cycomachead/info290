3.01,-12.8,3,3.25,3,2.5,3,"Poured aggressively, creating an enormous white head that fills the tall weizen glass to the rim. After a minute or so, the foam receded leaving a rice-cake like layer floating atop the golden, honey-colored ale. Minimal lacing. Although slightly hazy, the appearance more closely resembles a blonde ale than a wit. The label promises cinnamon, nutmeg and orange peel.  True to form, bright citrus scents greet the nose. Sweet pineapple, blonde malts and popcorn compete with hints of the aforementioned spices. The flavor is maltier than I expected, and the citrus is dialed in more than the aroma would lead one to believe. Pretty well balanced, as there is a fair amount of complexity, but it comes together in a way where little comes to the fore. The thin mouthfeel and light carbonation are bolstered marginally by the faint wheat haze. Ginger, nutmeg and a hint of grain in the finish. On the positive side, this is a pretty non-controversial beer. One could easily mistake this for a somewhat generic American lager with a little holiday spice added. I would have liked to see them go a bit bolder with this one. Also, if they are going to market this as a witbier, aptly named "White Christmas", then it should at least stay more true to the style. A whiter, wit-like appearance & less clarity. The underlying brew in this one is just not up to the task. The refreshing summer pale wheat ales just don't have the chops to compete with the darker spiced holiday offerings. I get what they were trying to do, but this one just doesn't move the needle much for me. I would gladly trade this beer for more Old Fezziwig, or even some of the past beers that have graced the winter seasonal 12-pack. Holiday Porter & Cherry or Chocolate Bock are all welcome replacements.","JohnnyI","Dec 28, 2014"

I said earlier and now repeat, I wish this beer could have asserted itself in some way, maybe with a little more orange zest, but I can't say I was disappointed overall. Great seasonal brew, I would definitely try it again next year.","yonker","Dec 17, 2014"

White Christmas is an unfiltered brew you can not see thought it. The smell is rich with grains and malts. Now for the taste is sweet with some grains. You pick up on some citrus and spice in this brew. There is a lot going on in this brew.  I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market. The mouthfeel is clean and finishing. There is nothing overpowering  in this brew, this brew has a nice balance to it. Boston Beer Company did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Dec 02, 2014"

It wasn't a very profound brew, but a good diversion away from the heavier, darker "winter beers" released by these guys and most other brewers. I might buy this again to bust the rut.","Caveworm","Dec 02, 2014"

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/amber color with a half inch off-white head that stayed around for a good amount of time. There's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and some orange and orange peel. It tastes pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some wheat/bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew, but I wish I would have been able to try this when it was fresher. Hopefully I'll be able to this upcoming winter!","bluejacket74","Jun 27, 2014"

Its decent, but very much dominated by spices, less yeasty and bready than a witbier normally smells. Taste begins rather sweet, with lots of sweet malt, sweet spices, mostly nutmeg and cinnamon and slight vanilla. Spices become more prominent in the middle of the sip, sweetness remains. Finish is sweet and spicy with a grainy aftertaste that has hints of vanilla. A good dessert beer, quite sweet, though not up to snuff for a witbier. Good for what it is though. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation and a crisp finish. Again, rather true to form, nothing wrong at all. Overall this is a decent witbier and a good Winter dessert beer. It doesn't standout from the crowd of witbiers, but for a sweet dessert beer its quite nice. Its enjoyable, but not amazing, a good middle road beer.","Auraan","Jan 17, 2014"

Light sweet maltiness and a hint of wheat grain round out the aroma. The flavor is over spiced gingerbread cookies. There's a hint of beer in here, but the spicing makes it hard for me to find. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick spicy mouthfeel. Not the beer for me.","johnnnniee","Jan 01, 2014"

3.64,5.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"A hazy pale gold in the glass, a swift pour yields a thick frothy head comprised of a mix of large and small bubbles. Once this subsides a nice layer remains which laces a bit. The smell is all spice up front. I'm hit by copious amounts of ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and orange. Beyond the spice there is a bit of wheat character both in terms of malt and characteristic yeast notes. The taste is ok, at first the spice is very noticeable. Beyond the spice there is a decent wheat beer base with the pale malts and wheat providing a bit of subdued sweetness. There is a surprising amount of hop in there as well and this bitterness combines nicely with the orange and citrus of the yeast to round things out. Body is pretty light as a fair bit of carbonation and low residual sugar prevents this from feeling heavy. Despite the spice the finish is also pretty clean with just a bit of citrus and spice lingering, not cloying at all. Overall I'm pretty happy with this one, seems like a take on the old Sam Adams White Ale but maybe with things toned down a bit. This is a good example of the style and a nice change of pace for the season.","fank2788","Dec 29, 2013"

I think the winter whear beer is a tricky thing to execute, want to get enough spices in there such that no one would confuse it for a summer, without going overboard. Hazy yellow color and soft white head. Obvious notes of citrus and spice, particularly nutmeg. Nice when you want a winter beer that might not weigh you down too much.

We enjoyed the aroma for its spicy inclusions, driving it deeper and making it aptly seasonal. The drinkability, on the other hand, simply facilitated being able to slug these guys back. While it was technically flawed in its overly watered airiness, this exponentially increased how easily it was sipped. Otherwise, we were disappointed that the flavoring didn’t express the same level of suitability that the nose did. Each component sat on its own, with the generic gritty grain underlying the spices and fruity tops. These never really came together, and were only loosely approximated by heavy wateriness. Harsh comments aside, this, as with their Blackberry Wit, hit the spot for what it was, and had its moment amongst friends who spent an evening catching up.","TheBrewo","Dec 18, 2013"

It has a nice light malty character with good fruitiness, and then the Aniseed at just the right level to be all over it, but still allow the other tastes there rightful place.

The most obvious part of the nose is the spice boquete, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, nutmeg, ginger and allspice. The level of unchecked spice smell actually makes the nose a bit nauseating. The level of spice is fairly high in the taste as well; however the nice balanced, toasty, malty backdrop it enhances fares much better in flavor than in smell. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant, medium in body with a chewy, slightly creamy carbonation. Overall, not a favorite of mine by SA, not my favorite Witbier - but if you're looking for a "Holiday" beer, this would fit the bill.","gmfessen","Apr 09, 2013"

Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon, orange peel, wheat, clove, pepper, pear, floral, biscuit, and earthy yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes. Taste of lemon, pear, cinnamon, nutmeg, orange peel, wheat, light clove, pepper, floral, biscuit, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, cinnamon, nutmeg, wheat, biscuit, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with spices being more muted than I expected from the nose; and zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good spiced witbier. Good balance of malt and spice notes with good flavor robustness; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

I usually don't like that much, but it was fairly inoffensive. There was not too much coriander and seemed to be more on the clove side as far as spicing. Very inoffensive, though. More suitable for a general audience. Despite this, I really wouldn't want to drink this around Christmas time. I'm glad I held onto a bottle until late March before reviewing it. I don't like to be too harsh on styles I don't like and at the very least, I'd like to review this beer at a time when I'm more open to it. This is a much better warm-weather beer than a cold weather one. Winter is a time for very dark beers. This is very much a light and fruity brew.","ElCommodoro","Mar 19, 2013"

Aromas of cinnamon and coriander on a bready backbone. The nose is subtle, other than the spices. Flavors of rich bread, with a heavy dosing of the clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and coriander spicing. Very well blended in the spicing, but very spice heavy overall. The backbone of toasted grains and bread support, but get somewhat overshadowed. The aftertaste is warming, with the spices blending around on the palate, leading into a clean, quick finish. Tasty, light beer that would be a crowd pleaser during holiday get togethers, but there are Witbiers out there that have more to offer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 30, 2012"

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was little too thick for me and the flavor didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one would be enough for me, I don't think I would want two in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it looked like a proper Witbier and it's just what I expect to see in this style. What I liked the least about this beer is the only thing that stays as strong as it did in the aroma was the sweetness, I would much rather have more wheat and spices. I don't think I will be getting this beer again, I might get it if it's release next year but a six pack is enough for me for this year, If you really like the style I recommend trying it but I wouldn't tell my friends that they have to try it. All in all this beer was decent and pretty true to style bit it was a little rough around the edges and needs a little more fine tuning, as far as noteworthy holiday beers I don't see this one making the list, and for the style I think I would rather have Bell's Winter White Ale.

2.66,-22.9,3,2,2.5,5,2.5,"Sam Adams witbier, all right all right. Pours out a dull straw color with a feeble head. Slightly transparent, decent haze. One whiff and I knew I had to take another...because I couldn't smell anything. On a deep inhale, I got some citrus and wet grains. Flavor is similarly nondescript, just a little tang upfront followed by a decidedly more pleasant husky grain finish. Does not really strike me as a wit, more like a mediocre hefe. Not that every wit should be a slave to the bananaclove flavor profile, but if you're going a different route, at least make it interesting. The strongest part of the flavor here is the mellow but long lingering wheaty aftertaste. The most notable feature of the beer as a whole is its incredible texture, which only makes me wonder what could have been if they had nailed the taste.","BeefyMee","Nov 10, 2012"

Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours hazy yellow orange with a thick white head and lots of tiny bubbles. The head dissipates slowly. The flavor is an interesting taste on the classic witbier. The wheat malt backbone is there with juicy orange flavor. I get the cinnamon and nutmeg, but they are not overpowering. The spices instead complement the flavors of this beer well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is very smooth and highly drinkable. This is a very good beer. Like a previous reviewer, I agree this beer gives us a reason to enjoy a wit in the winter.","acevenom","Nov 08, 2012"

3.97,15.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"It's 84 degrees out here in Florida. Christmas? Why not! White Christmas pours a golden-white color with a finger of head. The aroma is heavily spiced with all the usual suspects - cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc. There's also a strong orange aroma here as well. The flavor is very well-composed, the bouquet of holiday spices interact well with the strong orange flavors. The aftertaste is the nicest part of the beer, with the orange, a touch of wheat, and a bit of lingering spice leaving a very good impression. The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, White Christmas is a nice holiday beer. I'm not sure it needs to be with the fairly similar Old Fezziwig and Winter Lager, but it's tasty and well-done. Balance is the name of the game here.","shand","Oct 22, 2012"
3.63,5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I think it's way the hell too early for Bing-o to be crooning his signature at me, but that's a vain argument for another time. This stuff pours a hazy golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, coriander, light wheat, and a pinch each of black pepper and clove. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some brown sugar and some fairly strong ginger. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, though nothing is necessarily outstanding here, this beer was pretty tasty and enjoyable. The spices are definitely present, but they're also balanced against the citrus-y wheat so they don't get out of hand. Not bad.","TMoney2591","Oct 22, 2012"
