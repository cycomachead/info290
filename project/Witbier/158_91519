This is again that "American" idea of candying up and spicing up a European style of beer so it fits the typical American palate, but ends up destroying the beer. Where is the wheat too?

Pours a pearly yellow (wife said it's almost green), with no major head, light visible suspension, and kindof an oily look to the surface. Not too much to be said for the appearance, though I do give it points for some haze. Smells yeasty and funky, maybe some light lemon zest, not getting a lot off the nose, I must say. Watery, saggy mouthfeel, not much flavor, almost seems a little flat. Has a little zest to it and a medium to light sweetness, but just tastes like a watered down beer or maybe even lemonade to me. Was expecting something like a Hoegaarden but this beer does not come close. I think this is the second season they've done it and I hope it's the last. GD: give this one the boot and make a real wheat. Waste of a seasonal spot.","BeerWizard","Jul 04, 2014"

A few sips reveal a pleasant sweetness and yeast complexity, mingling with a nice bit of carbonation to cut thru and finish cleanly. Medium bodied, but finishes pretty clean.

I taste some citrus, orange peel or pith maybe, its pretty bitter but not from hops. more than any defining flavor this beer has a defining mouthfeel. its effervescently carbonated, like seltzer water only smaller and more alive bubbles, its super happening in the mouth which is right on for the first spring feeling day weve had here. this beer couldn't have come out at a better time, and it kicks the crap out of orabelle and Colette, their last couple of weird seasonal offerings that need never come back. this is first great divide beer to impress me in some time, you know I cant splurge for the barrel aged stuff, im a student still... overall this is a beer I will happily be drinking all summer as long as it remains on the shelves. impeccably well done, thanks for this. finally, something interesting and not watery for warm weather consumption! hard to keep a 6er around long...","StonedTrippin","Mar 28, 2013"
