Smell is of orange peel, coriander and some other spices; some banana and bread as well. Taste is a complex but well-balanced mix of the citrus (tart and sweet), wheat and spices. Very slight hops and a twinge of alcohol. Medium-light mouthfeel. Finishes very clean. Overall, a nice example of this style. Would pair well with seafood (this would be great with mussels), white meats, light pasta, veggies, etc.","xungmound98","Mar 29, 2014"

4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy and cloudy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, orange zest, coriander, banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of yeast and spicing notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, pear, apple, orange zest, coriander, clove, banana, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus zest, coriander, banana, clove, wheat, pepper, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance, robustness, and complexity of yeast ester and spice flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic witbier style! All around awesome complexity, balance, and robustness of yeast and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 01, 2013"

It smells of grass, grain, and malt, and not really of the spices listed as ingredients. So far this doesn't sound wildly different than one of my BMC reviews. However, the taste and finish is where this truly shines. Buttery malt, orange and lemon peels, the coriander, they all come through nicely, followed by quite a long finish featuring a tart citrus zing.

4.21,6.3,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Thin white head, pretty golden yellow color, very opaque, and some yeast chunks and sediment. Poor head retention yields a vanishing head. Aromatic belgian yeast, citrus and coriander pretty standard but nicely pulled off aroma. A nice marriage of wheat and fruity esters, a second sip reveals coriander, spice and orange peal. The finish is slightly more sticky and cloying then I would like. Pretty nice product here, I'd indulge again even with some of its short comings. Good flavor and aroma win out.","pmlondrigan","Jun 12, 2011"

Good amount of carbonation present, lots of tiny bubbles rising in the haze. I do believe I see yeast chunks floating, then settling at the bottom. I wasn't aware that this is bottle conditioned. Aroma is a classic note of citrus and spice. 1st sip is a tangy note of orange & lemon peel, spicy coriander, and biscuity yeast! Crisp and very refreshing! Mouthfeel is solid and firm, with a really nice sparkle from the carbonation. Drinkability is very high...even with the higher alcohol content, I could see myself easily downing one after the other on a hot summer day. In fact, the alcohol is so well hidden this could be one of those "careful-or-it-might-sneak-up-on-you" type of brews.

4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, I am happy with this beer from Southampton and I think it is one of their better brews. Though being a bit high in ABV for a witbier, it nonetheless pulls it off and doesn't end up being offensive the way you might expect a "double" witbier to be.

3.23,-18.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"D - Drinkability is moderate. At first the lemon is a deterrent, then refreshing, but as I near the end of the glass it kind of becomes a bit much. Some more spices and dryness to cut the lemon a bit would help, but it certainly is different.","nhindian","Jan 16, 2011"

The aroma is the weakest part of this beer. It is not bad, but really weak and understated. I do pick up some wheat and lemon. Maybe a little yeast as well. This is a chewy, thicker witbier. A lot of malt is in this beer. Solid malt foundation giving a nice wheat flavor. The added spices just playing a minor supporting role. The coriander and lemon are there but I had to go searching for them. I was not complaining as some Wits really go overboard with all the stuff brewers throw into their beers. Bigger in body than other Wits. A bit chewy and has less carbonation then most. It could of used a little bit more lift. Being a bigger beer it losses some of the drinkability aspects of the style.

Southampton Double White pours a lovely straw color, though with a disappointingly small head and not much lace left behind. This may be in part due to a bit of a flimsy pour by me though, so I won't drop it all the way to a 3. The nose is too subdued, but what's there is dominated by wheat, with some citrus notes lurking in the background. The first few sips are a letdown, there's barely any coriander or citrus presence at all and SH Double White tastes a bit watered down. I had this beer on tap a few months ago and remember loving it, so I don't know if I got a sixer from a bad batch or what the deal is, I'm gonna have to come back to this one somewhere down there road. The beer is a bit on the low end of the carbonation scale for the style, but I find myself appreciating that, and it's got a certain creamy quality to it that I'm digging. This beer is extremely drinkable, makes me wish even more that the taste was up to par. Southampton went big for a white ale and in some regards pulled it off well.

The higher alcohol content in this one is very evident, even cold out of the fridge and interacts negatively with the added coriander, orange and lemon peel.

This is my first time trying this, so I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle, but it has some common Belgian white flavors, but all underpinned by a noticeable lambic-like flavor that borders on vinegar. I'm not sure because it isn't an outright vinegar flavor, but has some complexity in it, like a white sparkling wine. I'll try again later.","dedrinker","Dec 16, 2007"

3.47,-12.4,2.5,3,3.5,4,4,"The Southampton Double White caught my eye by my local package store's display of current Great American Beer Festival wining beers. I figured if it won in Denver it's got to be good. From the hype (stickers on the cooler) I expected a Double White to blow my mind, but unfortunately that would not be. From the beginning the beer was lackluster. Little to no head, crystal clear appearance, slight to little citrus aroma. The taste was crisp. An initial hint of yeast then the quick blast of citrus and coriander to follow. This was a very refreshing beer I will give it that. But I walk away with this idea that this tastes very much like a typical white or maybe even a weiss that one would find at the bar with a huge slice of lemon floating in it. I don't know... maybe I am just completely blind or uneducated on the whole double white style, and my taste buds have yet to mature to truly grasp the greatness of this beer. I'm sure a panel of judges at the Great American Beer Fest probably know a thing or two more about this style than me, but the Southampton Double White Ale simply didn't move me in the slightest.","trkerrigan","Nov 28, 2007"

Aroma of huge bubblegum wheat and coriander is interesting and quite different from the norm. Taste is spicy with a strange mix between some coriander and huge presence of wheat with a strange bubblegum feeling. Body is definitely full with some adequate carbonation. While this beer is very interesting and innovative, I wonder if bigger is always better and if in this particular case I would probably prefer a regular wit (Allagash, Ommegang..) to provide an interesting but somewhat easy refreshing option.","Phyl21ca","May 08, 2007"

Preceding the lemon is a quick flash of the sweet sugariness and coriander. A nice nutty flavor in the aftertaste. Medium body, fairly soft, a little puckery from the lemon flavor and a small dryness in the finish.

Smell was an improvement, with that classic clean witbier aroma. Also I picked up on some orange flavors, and some dry grains. Taste had some great dryness in the front, followed by a bit of sour fruityness in the back. I can't quite put my finger on what this last lingering flavor is, it is sort of sour fruit mashed with a powdery medicine. Mouthfeel was the highlight for this beer in that there was perfect carbonation. Even with the 7% alcohol, I think I could make a session out of this beer. I enjoyed this one quite a lot.

Prickly carbonation up front along with big orange peel flavor that is quickly followed by a wheat-flavored body. This is just less than sweet of being almost like a Mikes Hard Lemonade, which I hate to admit that I love really, but it gives me heartburn.

It's a little acidic, with balanced coriander flavour, some smooth wheat sweetness, and a dry finish that leaves just a little peppery spice on the tongue.

The second pour leaves sheets and 1/2" thick clumps of foam on the glass. Smells almost like orange pineapple juice with hints of lemon. It starts with a prickly, medium body and a big peppery/coriander flavor with lemon, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, other tropical fruits, some yeast spiciness, and a mild to medium bitterness from the green/grapefruit hops.

Medium body with fine, fuzzy carbonation and a clean mouthfeel that made coming back to the glass easy. Fantastic beer and spectacularly drinkable.

Despite the streams of carbonation eminating from the bottom of the glass and nibbling the tip of the tongue, this is rather smooth and slick. Interesting complexion for a Wit!

Appearance was golden in color, not as cloudy as other Belgians. Was nicely scented with a bit of spice and some indeterminate fruit aroma. Citrus, yes, but also apricot? In a blind taste test, I'd have to think for a minute before I said "Hoegaarden" or "Southampton." The color is a dead giveaway, but the only real detectable difference comes in the finish, with the Southampton having a bit of harshness. Just a split second of that back-of-the-throat complaint you get when you drink a shot of some really cheap vodka. I didn't find it nearly the deal-breaker that others found it, but it's definitely there. I finished the 22 oz bottle a little too quickly, so it's definitely a beer I could enjoy again. Can't speak to how it fits in with other SPH offerings, as this is my first.","rarevos","Apr 15, 2006"

There's a substantial tartness all the way through, a light sweetness with solid bittering support. Slight coriander and typical orange. It sort of just fades into dryness in the finish with some slight astringency, not bad at all, but I was just hoping for more. Seems a bit one dimensional to me, and lacking subtlety. With the "double wit" billing i expected a lot more flavor. I'd like to see more coriander, but i'm a nut for the stuff. Coriander is one of my favorite spices.

Very slight black pepper. Nice profile. Quite the refresher. The beer is moderately carbonated and medium bodied.

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from a 22 oz bomber with no visible bottled on or drink by date. It is a very pale golden color with a medium sized white fluffy head. It is very hazy as most witbiers are. The head quickly faded leaving a bit of lacing. The aroma is fairly strong full of coriander and other spices with a touch of sweetness in the background, possibly brought on by the orange. The sweetness doesn't realy make it into the taste though, at least not compared to most wits. Instead, there is a bit of spiciness and coriander in the beginning with maybe just a hint of fruity sweetness. This gives way mid swallow to a fairly intense bitterness brought on by an orange peel element. Have you ever bitten into an orange peel? This is how this beer finished and it lingers well after the swallow. Not unpleasant though, because it is cut a bit by the sweetness mentioned earlier and the spices. This bitterness is joined by a rather apparent alcohol note, which is strange in a wit (of course, this is a "double wit"). This is a very good beer and a very interesting take on the style. The orange peel bitterness is just a little too strong for me, but I still really enjoyed it. I enjoed this with some sharp cheddar cheese.","Hagbard","Oct 28, 2005"

But once the mouth gets its chance, it is going to be credibly impressed. The ABV is hiked a bit for a wheat offering (hence the double appellation), but at no point during drinking is it overtly apparent, though it should be taken seriously, as it does act a bit sneaky on the back end. This is a fine beer with a whole lot going for it.

The cork was quite tight and when pulled out, gave a nice and loud pop. The body was pale yellow in color with some yeast induced cloudiness. The head was quite small in size due to my intitial gentle pour, although a steady stream of bubbles did stay around the entire session. My second pour was more aggressive, and a nice head did form at first, but it was not very lasting. The aroma was very musty and earthy at first, but as the beer breathed fresh air, the fruity scents of banana and orange, and some floral notes came more to the forefront. The taste was delicately light with a lemony, zesty flavor that was perfectly enhanced by spices that tasted like ginger, pepper, and coriander. The alcohol content was very deceptively hidden, and did not get in the way of the refreshing nature of the beer at all. The mouthfeel was light, and just a touch creamy. The aftertaste was dry and warm, thanks to the alcohol and the spices. This 2004 edition is a most delicious take on the style.","rajendra82","0"

Wheat flavors step-up to soften things out. Spices, a light breadiness, and some funky yeast dance in the backround. Alcohol does not show up in the flavor profile. Medium in bodied and siky smooth.

Citrus, yeast, spice, alcohol, carry this one, medium body, silky smooth mouthfeel. Interesting concoction, style buster. Another winner from Phil and crew. Got to meet the brewmaster at the Tiger's S'hampton night, allways a treat.","Billolick","May 14, 2004"

4.5,13.6,4,4,5,4,4.5,"The acidity in this is quite wonderful, nothing like a Lambic or a Flemish Sour, but it is here, and it is quite welcome. I really like this beer, of course I am a sucker for Wit beers. This beer finishes with a bit of astringency. This beer is straight forward, yet complex at the same time, refreshing yet contemplative.","Gueuzedude","Mar 26, 2004"
4.44,12.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dusty, ground coriander in the aroma. Moist and musty. A zesty beer too, to be sure, but this carries more weight to it. You can tell right from the outset. Medium-bodied -- more oomph than one might expect from the style -- and thick. Pleasantly flavored, however, with all the usual suspects -- coriander and orange...bits of lemon. A touch of yeasty, organic "blah" helps keep this from being too intense in some respects. Quite good; very drinkable.","marburg","Mar 08, 2004"
4.32,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"'03 bottling. Cloudy yellowish/orange, no real head to speak of. First wiff produced a funky barnyard aroma, but that was the first and last wiff I'd get of that. Damn. Subsequent aromas were more phenolic and fruity sweet supported by milder yeasty and spicy ones (I only picked up corriander 'cause it said it on the label, otherwise I probably would have missed it completely). Initial burst of flavors were sweet and fruity (orange, apricots). The middle was more lemony and yeasty and it finished a bit sticky, which was weird because it was medium to light bodied. I still couldn't pick up much of the corriander/orange peel aspects and I think that has to due it being a more mature bottle. Overall it was an extremely enjoyable, flavorful ale. It seemed to have more triple or double hefe (?) characteristics than "double white" ones, but who cares about style designations anyway? I'd thank Davo for the bottle but I won it as part of a bet (Pats Rule!) and I don't think he was too happy to depart with it. lol","pbrian","Mar 02, 2004"
3.85,-2.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"When I think of white ales I think of a pale ale that is cloudy. This beer is a dark orange color and is clear. It has a sweet citrus aroma and some cedar notes. There is a taste of corriander in the medium to full body. It has a slight bitter finish. I liked this beer, but it does not make me think of the wits that I have normally had. It was a good change of pace.","ark57","Mar 01, 2004"
4.8,21.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Mmmmm! I tried this lovely Southampton beer at an Oscar's party, split a bottle with my boyfriend. I could easily have had the whole bottle, but we only had 1 and so we had to share. At least I got some. It was a yellow-gold colour, cloudy, with a big white fluffy head that took a while to go down. It smelled wheaty, with apricots and spice, very nice. It tasted amazing- like a white but with so much more going on! I tasted a definite grape/wine flavor, mixed with peppery spicecake taste and apricots and a hoppy taste near the finish, a bit dry I guess you could say. Mouthfeel was very good, soft and silky, and again, i could've drank the whole bottle, but I can't complain, as I'm very glad to have had any at all.","erica","Feb 23, 2004"
4.6,16.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"750ml bottle, 2004 Edition: Pop the cork and pour. This is a very cloudy golden liquid with a frothy head of white foam. Aromas are those of a classic single wit beer, and consist of the following: coriander, pepper, other various spices, candy sugar, light bready malts, citrus fruits, and lightly snappy hops. The taste is spicy, malty, and hoppy on the back of the tongue. The alcohol precense is minimal, and this is very reminiscent of a souped up, more complex version of Hoegaarden. The mouthfeel is thicker than a regular wit beer, and more "triple like" in its carbonation. The drinkability is excellent, as this beer is insanely refreshing, yet slightly high in ABV. Watch out if you have a few of these....excellent stuff!","francisweizen","Sep 12, 2003"
4.5,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is something I'd like to try my hand at. I love witbiers and my wife enjoys them as well and this is quite simply an excellent witbier made with a bit more body (although not heavy) and just a hint of alcohol presence. The body is a little darker than the average witbier and a bit heavier (although if you've had Dogwood Summer, you've got an idea about it). The coriander and orange peel aromas meld nicely with the yeasty esters and phenols and the alcohol peeps through just enough that you know it's there, but not enough to slap you in the face and say "look at me! I'm big!" Great beer. I'd love to make a trip to this brewery's brewpub.","aracauna","Jul 06, 2003"

3.08,-22.2,3,2.5,3,3,4,"I must give a big thanks to herbjones for sharing this one with me. This pours a hazy yellow gold color with a white meringue head. There's absolutely no orange peel taste in here, but as the beer warms the spiciness comes out. It is very creamy on the palate & is a good hot weather beer.","jcalabre","May 12, 2003"
4.14,4.5,4,5,4,4,3.5,"Wits typically aren't my thing, but I'm warming up to this one as it warms up for me. Aroma was outstanding, but the sourness in the finish made it not so drinkable for me. A bit pricey at 9.99 for the 750, but still a well crafted ale that deserves mentioning. Thanks to Malto for the recommendation.","Stingray5","Beers"
