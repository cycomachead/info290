Aroma is wheat, sweet bread, coriander, Belgian yeast fruity esters of orange, banana & faint pineapple. Taste is typical for the style: wheat, pie dough, coriander, orange. The front half of the sip tastes similar to the nose being coriander heavy & sweet, fruity with the orange & banana dominant with pineapple joining in, in the latter half of the sip. Finishes disappointing bland & everything good & bad simply disappears in the dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, starts creamy but turns prickly, finishing a little bit slick.","mothmanscott","Jan 12, 2015"

The main difference here between this and other wits is that it's got a peppery feel to the wheat taste and the musky sharp cheddar dryness. I'd drink it again, and it's a good Wit if you're not too picky. I'd like another actually.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 21, 2014"

Some effervescence moving up the glass, a few bubbles at the top of the beer but no head and almost no lacing. S: Orange peel. Mild sweetness. I tried getting the coriander but I couldn't. Slight bit of malt. No hops. T: The taste pretty much follows the nose. Lots of orange, lots of sweetness. No hops at all. No bitterness for most of the drink. There is a very mild bitterness toward the bottom of the glass, but not much. M: Light bodied. Good carbonation. Very refreshing mouthfeel. O: This is not a bad beer, although there's not much happening with it. I would not pay for it again - especially at 8 bucks a sixer. However, if it was offered to be at a party or BBQ, I wouldn't refuse it. As a beer goes, it's rather boring. This is the first Belgian white I've ever had, so I can't rate it based on the style. If this is what the style usually is then I probably won't be a witbier drinker. I would have preferred a little hops. I think a beer needs some bitterness to make it a beer, even if it's just a little. On the other hand, as an all-around cold drink on a hot day, I certainly would not pass it up.","Jeaaej46","Jul 26, 2014"

3.04,-11.1,3,3.25,3,2.75,3,"I utilized an agitating pour, involving continually swirling the beer in the bottle as it was being decanted into a glass. This prevented any cascading, but it did produce two rocky, fizzy fingers of bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a slightly hazy light-yellow (SRM = 2). Nose smelled more like lemon zest than orange peel and with a black pepper spiciness. Oooh. It is already a hot, humid day, so I am hoping for something refreshing from this beer. Mouthfeel was thin, but fizzy, with loads of carbonation. The taste was kind of light for the style, but I definitely tasted the orange peel at this point. The finish was semi-dry with the coriander giving it a black pepper bite. It was, indeed, a refreshing beer, but it was lacking in taste.","woodychandler","Jul 07, 2014"

It's actually not that bed of a witbier--heck, I'd even say it's on par with Hoegarden--2014 Hoegarden I mean, not 1990s Hoegarden, before it got dumbed down.

A nice light feel, just as you'd expect from a wit. I thought this was a very nice effort from Spoetzl. While they usually give a nice low end version of most styles, a subtle style like a wit plays right into their sweet spot. One of their best offerings, I will be drinking more.","claytri","May 17, 2014"

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, a little fizzy, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these in a row but I think I might start to get bored with it after that and I think this would make for a nice spring time beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance in the taste, no aspect was too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but I thought it was a little too light and fizzy for the style. I don't think I would buy this beer again, but I might consider it if I'm really in the mood for this style and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all I didn't love this beer, but I didn't hate it either, it kind of fell right in the middle for me and I don't find it to be that memorable but I would say it's still pretty solid as far as the Style goes, keep up the solid works guys.","StoutHunter","Feb 12, 2014"

Smoothness, warmth, and a subtle yet varied fruitiness and spiciness all come together and make a tasty beverage. Perfect for anyone looking for a lighter bodied and flavored beer but with substance and intrigue.","beergoot","Jan 12, 2014"

3.47,1.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Shiner White Wine is going to replace Shiner hefeweizen, if sources are correct, and is only the second time Shiner has ever brewed a beer of this style. I find it a nice alternative to other Belgian wits and I like that it is a little less sweet than most. It offers some good refreshment and would make a good choice of beer on a hot day. Its lighter refreshment still offers enough taste and body to satisfy craft beer fans while still remaining approachable enough to satisfy the macro- brew crowd. It’s a good example of the style and one I will purchase again.","BryanCarey","Dec 04, 2013"

It's easy drinking and tastes good enough to have a few. I have a soft spot for Shiner beers. I will definitely be keeping some around through the summer months.","ChuckHardslab","Nov 24, 2013"
