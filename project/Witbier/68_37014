4.28,16.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"BBD 232/14. Pours a pale yellow with a very slight haze. Massive head with excellent lacing and retention. Very nice Belgian nose of coriander, orange and yeast with a slight pepper note. Light medium body with a smooth texture that has some creamy feel to it as well. Slightly above normal carbonation that yields a nice effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. The flavors of the nose are all present, with coriander and orange being most prevalent. The finish is crisp with just a touch of pepper underlying the coriander. While not as flavor intensive as Allagash White, this one is still outstanding.","tillmac62","Jun 26, 2014"

Sweet and fruity, with lots of citrus and light herb scents. The smell is a little malty, notably sweet, and it has a slightly spice and earth flavor. Almost no bitterness of hop presence in the taste. Very light in body. It's a refreshing and nice summer brew, but is overall fairly average for the style.","Suds","Jun 05, 2014"

Small particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some subdued spice aromas. Taste is much the same with muted fruity, citrus flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that still tastes fine even being almost 6 months past the best before date.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 03, 2013"

FLavors are light and crisp, with a spicing that enhances the toasted grain and bready backbone without overpowering it. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove combine to give a roasted, baked bread type flavor profile in mouth, while remaining light with citrus highlights.

4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Enjoyed from a bottle on a sun drenched 4th of July BBQ. Drank this beverage in a tasting with Ommegang Witte and Blue Moon. This beer was very close to Ommegang, exhibiting freshness and impressive quality. Yellow in appearance, Flying Dog succeeds again with this microbrew effort. Typical for a witbier though definitely as fresh as they come with citrus, banana, spices and other predictable flavors coming forth. Well done Flying Dog!","dstanmyer","Oct 29, 2011"

3.67,0,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I'd rank this one somewhere higher than Hoegaarden and lower than Allagash White. This has a very promising smell, but the taste doesn't quite follow through with the kind of complexity and balance that the best Belgian whites deliver. Carbonation possibly slightly excessive. Predominant tastes are light citrus/malt and corn, and the corn lingers a bit on the palate. This is a passingly good representative of the style, but it's not special enough for me to seek it out again.","ILessThan3Brett","Jun 19, 2011"
3.93,7.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Lemon zest and a slight summery tartness compliment a solid wheat flavor. The tartness is a little hidden, but so important to the whole character of this beer. That tartness makes it unique, finishing dry and clean and oh-so-refreshing. The wheat malt of this one is subtle and in the background, allowing the lemon flavor to flourish. I'm pretty impressed with the complexity of this beer on top of optimum refreshment. Flying dog does some things superbly well, like this beer.","chodinheaven","Jun 15, 2011"
2.69,-26.7,3.5,2,3,4,2,"Coriander like crazy in the nose almost to the point where I coughed. The taste is very sappy with tons of coriander. The flavor reminds me of the smell of a hot summer day.","bamojr","Jun 14, 2011"
3.53,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This Witbier pours out as a hazy yellow color the head a a bit foamy. The smell of the beer has a light floral wheat aroma with some spice in there too. The taste wasn't the most flavorful wit out there. I found that flavors in this brew fell short of my expectations here. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a decent carbonation. I would try this one again and see if I feel differently about it.","Knapp85","Jun 01, 2011"
3.45,-6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice hazy straw color with an one to one and a half finger stark white tight head. The color has some visable yeast. The smell is of lemons, corriander, anise, and some yeasty sweetness to it. A nice subtle inviting aroma. The taste has a lemon and wheat taste up front with some yeasty sweetness to it and the end and the backend. There is a very slight hop presence at the end to balance out the beer. The taste is average, not the best but not the worst. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and very carbonated. Overall you could drink a couple of these, there is nothing there to push you away, but not even flavor to have you begging for more.","goblue3509","May 31, 2011"
3.7,0.8,3,3,4,4,4,"A better brew than I expected. While cloudy enough to present "Double Shine" it lacked the transparency that gives the elegance I usually associate with this one in the glass. Yeast was dark and chunky. No lace. Aromas of wheat malt, dry cereal grains and faint lemons. An appealing yeast fruitiness. Taste is light, very dry and refreshingly clean. Wheat malt is the unabashed signature with a yeast that is an excellent counter to the malt. It brings a clean dry sourness while adding a light lemon note that develops the wheat twang. Bitterness is low but the dryness fills in the gap nicely. Light refreshing feel along with the dry finish makes this a perfect thirst quencher, lawn and grill companion. Goes down quickly and easily so drinkability is no problem. A really nice American brewing of a difficult style. Thanks Flying Dog!","scootny","May 26, 2011"

4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall: I am surprised this does not get more love. Of the witbiers I've had, I think this is my favorite only behind Allagash White and its a lot cheaper.

Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with sediment at the bottom with a half finger white head that subsides to a minimal amount fairly quickly. Maintains decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt and fermented bananas. The flavor is of sweet malt, wheat, and subtle fruit. It has a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this is a decent brew. Not awe-inspiring by any means, but decent. Aroma is little worse off than the flavor. Just something about the fermented banana smell puts me off. Just glad that it doesn't show up in the flavor.","thagr81us","Dec 04, 2010"
3.56,-3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the coriander with a little bit of orange peel.

3.04,-17.2,4,2.5,3,4,3,"After pouring the beer I noticed things floating around, im assuming their yeast. There isnt much aroma here. They say they use orange peel and coriander but im not picking up any. Smells like bananas and tastes like bananas, with a hint of wheat and oats. The mouthfeel is right for a Belgian Wit, but the drinkability isnt great. It doesnt taste terrible, but there are a lot of things missing from what I have had with Belgian Wits.

Light smell of hops but nothing to write home about. IBU on bottle 18, but drinks more around a 10. Color is a 4 on the SRM chart. Very clean transparency with very small carbonation bubbles. Does have a pleasing aftertaste of hops that clings to the back of my upper palette and through my nose.

Pours a pale yet hazy yellow, kind of like sunshine in the state of Maryland where this is brewed. Very little head, but what there is is persistent, leaving no lace however. Smell is refreshing but faint. Obvious hints of coriander to give it that Beglian "spiciness". It fails, however. Flavor is super-thin - almost lemonade like. It's clean and tangy, like a white should be, but it immediately finishes off, almost water-like, and has no length to the finish at all. This is what I'd imagine a hard lemonade would taste like, but without the good parts of the lemonade. Very poor effort all in all. However, at $8.99 a sixer, you can spare the change on occasion if you have friends who aren't beer drinkers.","SolomonGrundy","Jul 21, 2010"

The smell was very subtle citrus and spice; not exactly as prominent as one would come to expect from a wit. When the time came to taste it, the smell was dead-on, but dare I say dissolved quickly to an unpleasant, almost popcorn-ish finish. It felt light/medium-bodied on the palate, with decent carbonation. Given the bad finish in the taste department, even though the mouthfeel was good I wasn't reaching for another one.","donniecuffs","Aug 26, 2009"

The flavors were well balanced and totally on point for the style with the sweet malt and hints of cookie dough up front followed by the floral hops in the middle and the Belgian yeast at the end. The finish was a little yeast-y for me, but I appreciated the flavor arc and distinct notes within. The mouthfeel was good but a little oily, the body medium and the carbonation just touch high.

Flavor is huge with citrust and coriander as well as some belgiany spice. The spice, though, is subtle and doesn't become unpleasant. Mouth is light yet full-bodied. Very refreshing. Again, the spice doesn't override the citrusy characters. Its extremely drinkable, and considering the low abv very sessionable as well.

Fine lacing forms evenly with each sip, quite artsy. Aromatics offer up citrus and banana smoothie infused bread dough with sharp hints of lemon peel and light anise. Flavor goes a bit overboard on the chalky spiced anise kick but edges out enought with citrus and light banana tones to make up for it. Creamy pale malts with light herbal hops bringing in a chammomile like tea experience. Mouthfeel is light bodied with pretty effervescent head, when I popped the cap it let out some bubbly like carbonation. Drinability is solid especially when it's in the 4s as far as abv goes.

The carbonation is moderate, but the medium-bodied mouthfeel is somewhat cloying, with an offdry finish.

2.98,-18.8,2,4,2.5,3,3,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. I've had most of the Flying Dog brews, and this was probably my least favorite. It didn't have much to offer. The appearance was a lighter gold. Despite an aggressive pour, there was almost no head and no lacing. The beer smelled of oranges and grape fruit and had a few spices. The taste of the beer kinda reminded me of vitamin water. The beer was way to watery, and the citrus taste comes in almost as an after taste. The taste was dominated with oranges, but seemed to have a lemon-lime mix to it. I really didn't feel like having another beer after this one. Honestly, it would probably be best to drink this beer on a warmer day rather than a cold winter night, as I can see this beer being refreshing.","Jablonski","Jan 13, 2009"

It gets a 4.5 for being even-keeled, and not for being some insane ride of flavor. And also for the fact that this is an American producer putting out something so well done. Feel is as expected. A bit thinner on the liquid with a nice smooth carbonation. Overall the theme for this ride is "smooth".

Coriander, lemon and wheat in the nose, with generous belgian Wit phenols like band-aid, earthy yeast and banana ester. Sweet wheat and sharp pils malt upfront, followed by a dry and slightly tannic aftertaste that finishes up with tart phenolics and mellow herbal hop flavor. The hop bitterness is appropriatly light with the spice and sharp pils notes balancing the mildly sweet wheat and malt taste. The body is light and the carbonation level is very high, producing an extra crisp and refreshing mouthfeel with a hint of tart Witber phenols and suggestion of apple/banana exter twang. The finish is clean with spice and yeast tones that vanish quickly. American beers of this style seem more numerous than those from its country of origin, but as long as they hold a high drinkability like this without sacrificng flavor, I will say that the USA is the best place to look for Witbier.

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"A very good example, and rare quality, found in American attempts at a Witbier. The beer hits a home run. Very flavorful, but lightly textued, with pepery character, mild hops, and an estery spiciness that finishes very powdery and clean. But there are a few characteristics that keep it from becomming a Hoegaarten. The beer opens with a bright yellow / golden color that falls just short of 'bright', however with ideal head retention and creamy carbonation. Aromas are a characterful blend of wheat malt, clean esters, light citrus fruits, and a fresh peppery qualtity. The scent of Saison begins to make it's way into the beer after warming, with a mild must and earthy scent. Although characterful, may muddle the aromas a bit. Flavors are equally as satisfying as aromas. A bit higher hop rate separates this beer from Belgian counterparts. Picks up on more of a lime / pineapple flavor, rather than the predominant orange flavors that are typical of the style. The body may be a touch high, but does not hurt the drinkability or quality of the brew. Finishes quite clean and powdery-clean, with a solid dryness. Lightly hopped and warming late. Very good beer; it picks up on some earthy, musty characteristics that help the beer as much as it hurts. About as good as an American Wit gets.","BEERchitect","Aug 16, 2007"

5,36.2,5,5,5,5,5,"poured a cloudy straw yellow with a good one inch white head that held well and sheets of lacing down the glass. nose is strong with coriander, clove, pepper, lemongrass. taste, wheat malt, yeast, coiander, pepper, lemongrass, peppery and tangy on the finish. light and smooth mouthfeel and carbonation is good. smell and taste are strong nothing subtle about this beer. great tasting beer from flying dog brewery.","billybob","Jul 02, 2007"
3.77,2.7,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"While you could session this one there are lots of other wit's that are better.","peabody","Jun 25, 2007"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy straw color. Fluffy white head with good retention, and, a nice lace. Lots of bubbles. Smell is of lemon,clove,and spice. Body is light,crisp,and carbonated. Taste is of spiced fruit,and candy. Great from start to finish. I plan on having much more of this beer over the summer!","riversider76","Jun 24, 2007"
3.24,-11.7,3,4,3,3,3,"Drinkability - Summer grass-cutting beer. Had I not already picked the Harpoon Raspberry Wheat as my summer beer, this one may have been up there. I very much enjoyed the big nose on this one which was a lot of the appeal.","Nesued","Jun 23, 2007"
4.43,20.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Great Wit, spicy, herbal, fruity, delicious. Flying Dog turning it around? Will pedestrian micros flavors give way to fantastic crafts and big beers? I am surprised. I have not had a decent Flying Dog other than Gonzo, and Gonzo and this Wit break the boring Colorado trendy big cutesy micro mold.","sacrelicio","Jun 21, 2007"
4.12,12.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A very nice, soft, rounded Wit. I've had better, crisper, sharper, but this was a nice change of pace. Would pair well with a nice Mandarin Orange salad, any whitefish, lemon and/or orange chicken with a little zing, just about any lite warm weather fare. If you like a little roundness in your wheat beers as opposed to a sharper, crisper edge definitely check it out.","BuckSpin","Jun 20, 2007"
4.19,14.2,3,4,4,4.5,5,"There's nothing here that's horribly unique or bold or exciting or anything like that--just a solid, slightly above average example of its style. A great summer session beer that goes down as smooth as chocolate milk.","mynie","Jun 17, 2007"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Surprise! I said something good about a Flying Dog beer for a change.","ColoradoBobs","Jun 16, 2007"
1.48,-59.7,4,1,1,4,1,"I'm not the only one that disliked this one. Rochesterinsider.com's June 20, 2007 review stated "Thumbs down. The smell's unappealing, and there's a soapy taste."","rohrbachsfan","Jun 16, 2007"
3.36,-8.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, a decent wit. It's more musty and less spicy than most.","Beaver13","Jun 15, 2007"
3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,4.5,"Got one of these in a mix a six at my local place. Pours a cloudy lemonade color, very hazy. smells lemony with yeast and a slight spicy hopness. Tastes is good, but it could of been great, needs a little more spiciness, but still good. mouthfeel is a bit watery not much body to it, but on a hot day like today, i could take plenty of these guys down.","1fastz28","Jun 15, 2007"
4.35,18.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Drinks really easy, not one of my favorite styles, but they nailed this. I certainally liked this better than NB's organic wit, which I had twice on draft","russpowell","Jun 13, 2007"
4.1,11.7,3.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Drinkability: Light and refreshing; a good effort at this style","brentk56","Jun 11, 2007"
3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The mouthfeel is full-bodied but not in a creamy sense. More of a starchy, grain-like texture with some carbonation.","letsgopens","Jun 11, 2007"
3.15,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Too much black pepper for me, making it not as smooth as it should be. It hits the style in general, but only mediocre at best, IMO.","jwc215","Jun 10, 2007"
4.29,16.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability- This is one of the smoothest Flying Dog beers I have ever had. I could have this on a hot summer day and it would be a toss up next to Hoegaarden. A fine wit.","blakesell","May 27, 2007"
3.63,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall impression: Nice drinkable wit. Not nearly the best Wit out there, but better than average as far as a Flying Dog offering.","rowew","May 26, 2007"
