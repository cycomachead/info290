Aroma has heavy yeast driven and spicy notes of coriander and orange peel additions. The yeast notes and spice additions combine into this chalky, citric, chamomile tea like quality. Flavor has soft bitterness that tastes floral, spicy coriander, citric notes, lavender herbal quality very complex well made witbier maybe too much spice for some witbier drinkers but in my opinion it stays balanced. Mouthfeel, I've enjoyed every Revolution beer I've tasted so far, the textures here are perfect slightly creamy edge from the wheat additions, spicy adds a nice dry finish with some upfront wheat notes, bitter orange peel levels the malt layers out as well. A great food and drink beer, this would pair well with so many different dishes rosemary/garlic braised lamb, white fish, any chicken dish. Overall a complex refreshing well executed witbier canned in Chicago.","WVbeergeek","Jun 04, 2014"

Refreshing and easy drinking like a macrobrew but with more of a backbone. I couldn't pick out any flavor aside from "beer" but it was definitely hearty and satisfying.

It got everything in suspension out of suspension and the result looked like banana cream pie with meringue topping. Two fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with great retention sat atop a murky, yellowish liquid that looked like either freshly-squeezed grapefruit or banana pudding. Man, as a kid, I used to love instant banana pudding with real banana slices. I still love eating bananas. Yellow, amusing, tasty. Back to basics. The nose smelled like someone emptied the spice rack! I remember a Playboy cartoon as a kid where the guy is positioned to partake of some salmon and he looks upward with the caption being, "I knew this was going to be good, but seeing a spice rack above your headboard ... !" I did not get it at the time, but I do now. Gutes essen! Black pepper or lemon pepper was prevalent, but so was coriander and allspice. The first, and I hesitate to call it a sip, more like a draught, was big and full, not quite viscous, but getting there, and the spices were fantastic. I think that I caught some vanilla in the mix, rounding the edges. Man, but the spices were prevalent in this one. I used to love to cook as a teenager and I was probably better versed then than I am today, but this was like a spice melange. Finish, as you CAN probably imagine, was bone-dry. I felt like I had been licking alum this afternoon. All of that said, would I put in the cooler? Perhaps a few, depending on who was coming along. If it were just me, one might be enough.","woodychandler","Aug 22, 2013"

Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A touch watery, but its not too bad.

4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Revolution is a brewery you can really get behind. All their beers are very good, and they know their food as well. This is a dangerously drinkable Wit. Chugable even! Funky hay smell with a taste of bread and candied orange zest. The balance is really what makes this beer. My only gripe is the cost, because you can just polish these off! Was it Marx who said opiates are the beer of the masses??","OttoPeeWee","Oct 08, 2012"

3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"So, does only one person get to drink then...? Anyway, this stuf pours a lightly hazy pale brass topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises coriander, light black pepper, cracked wheat, lemon zest, orange zest, and a touch of cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, with those orange tones really pulling their weights here. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally crisp (if still a touch wet) finish. Overall, a very nice, very refreshing little witbier.","TMoney2591","May 09, 2012"

3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I've heard servers tell people this beer is "Like Blue Moon for grown-ups". I enjoy the mild spiciness and citrus notes, but I occasionally get a sulfidic "twang" in the back of the throat following my first few gulps. I've noticed this more when the beer is really fresh. It's appearance when freshly tapped looks more like pale OJ than a beer, other than the wonderful froth that sticks around for quite some time. When in this state, the yeast is almost too much, and contributes to the aforementioned twang. Their beer always seems fresh (probably because it is), but this one benefits from sitting in the tank a few extra days. Ask the bartender if it's a new batch or not prior to committing to 16 oz. When I've ordered it outside the Logan Square brewpub (which it's starting to pop up in several other spots) this hasn't been a problem.","Hopfist","Apr 25, 2011"
3.43,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"O: A decent witbier, but I would pass on it given another opportunity. The mouthfeel really did it in for me and the flavors were kind of muted.","Treebs","Jan 03, 2011"
4.27,15.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The mouth is slick with midlevel carbonation. I think this a pretty good example of the style and I would have no problem repeating this one.","Redrover","May 07, 2010"
4.32,16.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a very hazy yellowish color with a bit of gold to it. Nice white head and a bit of lacing as it falls. The nose is really nice and does a superb job hitting all the hot points in the style with a great wheat base along with some nice orange and a slight bit of coriander. Great balance between everything. The taste is the same, offering a bit of sweetness and the perfect amount of coriander and citrus peel to complement. Good body; a bit creamy. Drinks quite well. I really enjoyed this. One of the better wits I've had in a long time.","Thorpe429","Mar 25, 2010"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Much like the other Revolution beers which I have sampled to this point, I can only describe this as unique. Someone below me said this before I could say it, but it does seem like a fairly modern twist which has a decent classic backing. Some may disagree with me, but I found the coriander to be the defining element of this beer. It makes this beer both lively and unique. It may not be for everyone, but I found it enjoyable; definately try it once if you're looking for an interesting interpretation of the style.","diabecktic","Feb 11, 2010"

4.27,15.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor was more punchy with light orange peel, and a supple mellow feel from the wheat. It finished dry with a mildly tart citrus peel note in the background. Not too heavy or phenolic as some Wits can be, it was nicely balanced, and a touch on the bigger side. Mellow carbonation, with a soft mouthfeel. The flavors really shined in this Wit, and i've had a few in my day that I can say it stands out from the rest. Definitely traditional with a slightly amped up edge.","emerge077","0"
