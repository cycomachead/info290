4.25,17.4,,,,,,"Pours a deep mahogany in color with some reddish highlights with a thin off-white head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is light but is of dark bread with some malts and nuts. Pretty much the same for the taste with a slightly bitter finish for the black walnuts and much stronger than the aroma suggests. Not your average wheat beer taste. Very smooth and is a good tasting brew. Between lighter and medium bodied with perfect carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Sep 29, 2014"

3.63,0.3,3,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, hint of nut, hint of hop, hint of roasted malt, and slight mushroom aromas. Fits the style of an American Dark Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of nut, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of mushroom, lol. Overall, weak appearance and lacking complexity, but good aroma and body.","Tone","Jul 17, 2013"

4.08,12.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Okay, I expected this to be a gimmick, sweet, artificial, all sorts of bad. I am happy to be wrong on all counts. This is well done, nutty, well balanced, and just plain good. I have absolutely no idea how readily available this is, but if you see it, try it.","jokelahoma","Beers"

4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I had this at a festival at the Public House in Rolla. There were a lot of great beers there but by far this was my favorite. It is not what you expect form the name and that was the intention of the brewer. It was a little bit darker than most American Wheats but I was reluctant to call it a dark wheat. It pours with moderate head and lacing. An awesome aroma of wheat malt and berries are appearent before you even it get it close to your nose. It has peppery and berry like taste produced by the walnuts that is unlike anything I have ever tasted. There are not much for nut esters mainly berries and some clove. It has some bit to the body but is mainly very smooth. It is a great late summer early fall beer.","MTNboy","0"
