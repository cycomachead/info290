3.59,9.8,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, some spices are apparent. Taste is of mild lemons, some spices, a bit of wheat, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer.","tone77","Apr 20, 2014"
3.6,10.1,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"o: I like this! It's complex enough to be interesting without being overbearing and pretentious. It's just a nice, smooth, beery-bready-flavoured beer. This is going on the "classier-than-usual summer evening quaff" list.","Antikythera","Apr 12, 2014"
3.07,-6.1,3.75,3,3,3.25,3,"Pretty straightforward pale ale taste with its biscuit malts, clean, hop balance and sweetness. Nothing that sets it above the fold. Drinkable for sure.","puboflyons","Mar 13, 2014"

If pairing with food, I would recommend a wheat-bun burger to go with it, and have a mildly spicy sauce on it. Flavors really open up with that pairing.","Metal_N_Brew","Beers"

3.56,8.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"I saw no reason to hold back and went with an aggro pour, resulting in a dense, foamy finger of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a strong malty sweetness, slightly bready, slightly biscuity. Mouthfeel was medium with a big, sweet presence on the tongue. Finish remained fairly sweet and I found myself thankful that I only traded for one of these. It is not that there was anything intrinsically wrong with it, nor was it out of spec for the style guidelines as promulgated by this site. Instead, I just prefer something hoppier and when I do not get it, I tend to move on. Caveat emptor!","woodychandler","Apr 12, 2013"

Kind of a boring beer, I have to say. Nothing really going on flavor wise that holds my interest.","RblWthACoz","Feb 06, 2013"

3.38,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a mostly clear copper with a chill haze. Aroma of orange citrus and some spicy notes. In the taste mildly bitter citrus hops and a small earthy dry spice. Mild tangy sweetness but this beer is more than bitter enough to balance out. Medium bodied and very crisp with a small dry spice. Overall this is a nice wheat ale. Well crafted and enjoyable.","Stinkypuss","Beers"

2.44,-25.4,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O: Not sure if age was a factor here, carbonation was as strong as ever which hints otherwise. Sweet, with an extract like twang, boring nose and flavor wise can't see this getting much better. pass.","beerthulhu","Jul 24, 2012"
2.98,-8.9,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a clear, medium brown/amber color with a perfect off-white head. Some slight scents of wheat and malts, but nothing overpowering in the smell. Taste is quite mellow and very light. You get some hints of raw wheat but that it is. The actual taste is fine, there just need to be more flavor behind it. Overall a weak beer that needs work, but I guess itâ€™s all about marketing it as a USDA organic in the end.","Lemke10","Jul 14, 2012"
