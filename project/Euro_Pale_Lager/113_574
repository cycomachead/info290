4.11,7.3,4,4.25,4,4,4.25," The taste begins with malt that is mild and yeast fruitinesss with a slight apple/pear quality wiht subtle sweetness level and a hint of spice in the periphery with a slight toasted grain flavor in the middle. The flavor is on the dry side with herbal hops adding to the flavor with mildly bitter taste as it finishes. Overall I consider this very good - a clean lager with a lot of flavor -excellent drinkability for the style","Slatetank","Dec 07, 2014"

4.5,17.5,,,,,,"This is just a great beer.  Such a simple brew solution yet the product of this labor is perfect!  It's the only lager I've ever found to have malty legs.  Its perfect blend of barley and hops gives you the sense that its malty and bitter attributes are released on to your taste buds for an epic battle (which is ultimately just won by the hops army).  The finish is crisp but doesn't leave your tongue feeling dry.  The complexity of the competing flavors makes for a fantastic taste interrupted by nothing as the malted barley and hops in this beer are organic.  It clearly makes a difference.  I would enjoy this beer in the company of the most boring and annoying people in the world.","Larry_Moon","Nov 06, 2014"
4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/15/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops ,and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean and robust flavors for a pale lager as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent pale lager style. All around great balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth, crisp, and clean to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 23, 2014"

3.86,0.8,4,3.5,4.25,3.25,3.75,"Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager Beer pours a brilliant, clear gold, with about a 1/2" of fluff adorning the top. Bubbles are consistently rising, indicating a fair amount of carbonation. It's almost perfect, as the head also clings to the side of the glass nicely. The nose is that of fresh baked bread, and the smells of Spring fields. A soft, European hop aroma can be detected within as well. While the scents leads one to believe the beer will be delicate, the taste is much more vibrant. It's got a hearty, buttery malt taste in the background with the crisp, yet floral hops coming in next. The fading sensation in the finish is gradual and pleasing. The mouth feel is very light, borderline watery. The best way I can describe it is that the back of the throat is filled with the presence of the beer on the way down more than the beer actually coats the mouth during each sip. This is a great beer to get someone started on the finer lagers in life, or for any beer enthusiasts who are skeptical about European lagers or lighter ABV beers in general.","Neorebel","Apr 15, 2013"

The taste holds notes of dried honey, light toffee, even lighter biscuit, and a vague sense of funky lemon peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, though I could possibly see this working well on cask (don't ask me why, I just get that impression here), it just didn't do it for me out of the bottle.

The taste of it is similar to Sam Smith's Organic Lager, but with less of an acidic aftertaste. The soft water in Pure Brewed Lager helps it go down smooth and easy. There is a good amount of carbonation that blends well with the grainy aftertaste. It's very pure tasting with well balanced flavors and texture, something I can drink regularly.","DarkBeer","Nov 05, 2012"

In the taste, almost has an ale yeast fruityness, with apple and pear flavor. Some buttery diacetyl, bread and leafy hops. Not too bitter, but hardly too sweet either. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, carbonation is at a low medium. The feel is a little flimsy and not quite as crisp, but still fine.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"My pour gave me a finger-and-a-half of thick eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Perhaps I should have waited until a dreary February day to have opened this one ... Nose smelled of pure, unadulterated lager - slightly sweet with an underlying earthiness. It is never going to knock your socks off, but when you have been on a steady diet of AALs as I have been with The CANQuest (TM), a clean adjunct-free lager is a welcome treat. Mouthfeel was medium with a honey-like taste that is (or should be) lager's trademark. Man, I just weep for what we Americans wrought with Prohibition. People developed a taste for bootleg hooch made with whatever was at hand and lost their taste for well-made beer. Boo hoo. At least some breweries did not do away with their traditional recipes. Finish was clean, refreshing and semi-sweet, just as I would hope all lagers to be.","woodychandler","Aug 16, 2011"

It's got a nice bitter finish and a little bit of sweet grains in there. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side with some good carbonation.

Good balance, enough bitterness to keep the flavour crisp while letting the sweetness of the malt and grassy/herbal hop flavours stay in the spotlight. Light caramel. Lingering bitterness and mineral character. Slightly crisp carbonation, light to medium bodied, dry, the texture's more rounded and smooth than a good pils. Easy drinking and quite tasty.

A lot of simple sugars on the nose, a LOT of apple, a bit of apricot, a bunch of light wafer. Pleasant and snack-like. Taste is just as sweet and has a pronounced floral quality that twists quickly into a decently bitter finish. Mouthfeel is slick. A good, crisp linger and dryness at the end. Drinkability is definitely above average, but it's enough like a dessert beer, imo, that intake of a 550 ml bottle will suffice. Very nice.","sixerofelixir","Apr 08, 2010"

Decent pale yellow color and nice foamy head, a bit hazy with light carbonation visible. Fruity hops (a la euro lager) in the nose, with malt coming through in the first sip, but balanced fairly well by the hops. As euro lagers go, this one was free from the typical "skunk" smell and I attribute it to the really heavy brown bottle it came in. Quite drinkable and enjoyable, but not particularly complex.

Taste is much sweeter than Smith's Organic Lager with an almost spiced, herby aspect to it.

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some herbal/grassy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light, with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, it goes down pretty easy and it's non-offensive. It's a decent beer overall, but for the price I don't think it's a good deal.

Moderate carbonation, right on for the style. The creamy rich taste was really impressive, and made for a very very drinkable beer. I was more than surprised and will definitly reach for this again.
