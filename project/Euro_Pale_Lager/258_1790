The taste was odd, grassy, but with a light cheesiness like sharp cheddar. It was not prevalent, but it was noticeable all the same. Finish was light, spritzy, semi-dry, nice on a hot, humid day after some gardening, but there are much better iterations of the style out there.","woodychandler","Jul 19, 2014"

A pretty nice, full look for a Euro Pale Lager, not bad. Scents of skunky hops, grainy malt, biscuity malt and some faint malty sweetness. An expected aroma for a green bottled Euro Pale Lager. Taste begins with slight sweet grainy flavors and faint maize, moving into some hop extract and floral/herbal hop flavors. Finish is semi-dry with a hop extract bitterness, grain husk and sweet malt. Aftertaste is dry with notes of herbal hops, floral hops and bitterness, with slight graininess. A decent flavor for a Euro Pale Lager, a lot more flavor than the American lagers. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and semi-dry feel. Fairly true to form for a lager, not bad. Overall a fairly good Euro Pale Lager. Not the best, but a pretty good flavor profile overall, though the aroma is a bit of a letdown. Not bad but not really worth having again.","Auraan","Jun 29, 2014"

The head to this brew goes away fast. The smell is really skucky with some grains. Not what I was looking for in the smell but that is the style of brew. It also does not help that it comes out of a green bottle. The taste is bitter and skunky at first. The after taste is smooth and clean. The mouthfeel at first is not so good but it nice at end.

The subject of a recent advertising campaign here in Alberta (and likely elsewhere in North America). Looks like a standard mass-produced Euro pale lager, maybe just a hair darker, a straw lemon yellow with a fearsome degree of carbonation. Smells of sweet doughy malt, baker's yeast, a hint of dry grassy hop (extract most likely). Initially quite sweet to my palate and thick for the style but manages to finish dry. Inky oxidized malts, white bread, cloying sweet yeast and hints of floral vanilla and honey buttress some faint hay-like hop notes and a plastic aftertaste. Almost evokes Stella Artois in terms of having some yeasty character but nowhere near that good. One to tick off the list but glad I did not purchase in quantity and probably would not sample again.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 11, 2014"

I usually guzzle these from the bottle though. an abundance of pilsner malts cascades the nose, with the adjunct malt sweetness and metallic aromas as well, bittering hops only. the taste matches, malt forward, not a totally corn beer, but far closer than craft offerings. mouthfeel is the best feature here, this one really goes down easy, is only a little filling in great quantity, and actually refreshes pretty well when its cold. the lightness and clean characteristics are appreciated, but the flavors just aren't bold enough to hold my attention. if this was cheaper, I could see it having a role to play in the greater beer world, but it prices itself out of that range, and doesn't back it up with taste, my biggest complaint. I drank a lot of this in Australia, always "borrowing" from my neighbors outside fridge, but revisiting it just has not had the same level of satisfaction for me.","StonedTrippin","Jul 30, 2013"

Yet I can respect that they serve a role and function in the beer world, and for me it is nostalgia. So thank you Peroni.","SSS","Jul 13, 2013"

Totally unremarkable. Crisp and light bodied, with lively carbonation and a clean, dry finish. Decently refreshing, also fairly watery. Not the worst of the bunch but nothing special either.

Light lacing. Arome is pretty damn clean with only that slightest smell of dirty europe. Slightly sweet. Taste is the same. Sweet grainy malt dominates. Light hops and a decent pepperiness gives this beer an edge over many euro lagers. Feel is okay but could maybe use a little more carbonation.

The taste of the beer was toasted malts, but was clean and crisp, but still average at best.

Taste is slightly sweet from the malts, with distinct grain and hay characteristics noted at first, followed by a very light metallic flavor which quickly gives way to some decent bitterness, leaving a fairly desirable hoppiness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is light, watery and overly carbonated with a dry and bready feel to it, but it seems to suit the taste of this beer fairly well. Not a bad beer, the light and watery feel, combined with the mild flavors and light sweetness combine to give an easy drinking euro pale lager, just put aside the skunkiness and this one's an easy drinker...","jsdunlop","Dec 29, 2010"

But, yesterday I had a pitcher at an Italian restaurant, and was surprised at how well it paired with the garlic-rich pasta with white sauce and chicken. This dish brought out the beer's understated but smooth maltiness. Bottom line is that it's not too great to drink by itself, but it can complement the right Italian food.

The taste was pretty adjunct/euro pale lager run-of-the-mill sort of stuff, the same sort of thing I've said about the majority of aspects and facets to this beer. The flavor consisted of some malt with a very, very thin to nonexistent hop presence. It's simply average, but could have been improved with a significant amount of more hoppiness. This beer is a light beer: both mouthfeel and flavor. Drinkability for this one is about average. The ABV makes it possible to sit around a knock a few of these back in a sitting, but the beer experience of it would make me want to reach for something else entirely.

3.05,10.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"This may be the most bitter lager/light lager I've ever tasted. Perhaps relentless, ropy bitterness is what industrial lager needs to make it sustainably drinkable. Let me think ... it's possible I guess. The first taste was surprising and unpleasant. Stewy cereal aromas and vague impressions of lemon and herb aromas were followed by an intense grip of drying tannins. These left a chalky, leathery feel, though there was nothing dirty or impure about it. Brassy, simple golden grain sugars are overwhelmed by saliva-coagulating chemistry. This may appeal to folks who are suspicious of sweetness and want a light beer. Fans of over-extracted, unsweetened tea and espresso who desire whisper-light lager may want to try this. I would like to see this concept reworked with quality ingredients and more care. Fundamentally though, this is industrial beer with the kind of styling that makes it irrelevant in sweet-toothed North America.","putnam","Jun 20, 2005"

The taste however seemed more hoppy upfront. There was a definite grassy hoppiness the dominated my palate with sweet malts coming in underneath. The finish was slightly sweet and decently crisp.

There was a straw, dried grain flavor throughout with no real detectable hops and very little malty quality. It smells much the same way it tastes.

The head that was present was the consistency of a pillow, fluffy, full and white in color. The retention was very good and lasted till approx. ½ glass before falling to a light film and a semi-thick ring on the edges. There was lace present, spotty and seemed to be kind of watery. The aromas that came from the glass were light on the nose – light hops (floral), some citrus notes, and malt waves (both sweet and semi-caramel) all intertwined in the nose. The taste was semi-sweet on the tongue, tones of sweet malts, citrus, grains, floral hops and finished with a bread taste. The aftertaste was a mix of light hops and bread. Not overly lasting and slowly disappears after a few moments. Light-medium bodied. This was a fairly crisp, and clean, alittle on the sweeter side then crisp, but a drinkable beer. I was surprised on how refreshing it was. I would have liked the aromas and flavors to be slightly more pronounced but over-all not to bad.

At first taste it seemed pretty good, but after that it tasted much like water, almost worse than Bud and Miller. With the lack of carbonation, mouthfeel is mediocre too. With all that said, I don't think this a very good beer at all.

The mouthfeel is a bit harsh, with the carbonation attacking the roof of my mouth through the rather thin body of the beer.

At any rate, it is not a bad euro pilsner/lager but it is not worth paying $3-4/bottle for in a restaurant, or $8/sixpack. The other beer I had that night was a Moretti, before the salad arrived. It did not taste fresh.  Too bad because when it's fresh, Moretti Pilsner actually has hop flavor and aroma that the Peroni lacks.","EagleTalon","May 12, 2002"

The biggest aspect is its sweetness. Unusually sweet for a lager, but it's great for drinking with a meal.","aracauna","Mar 26, 2002"
3.53,27.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I noticed some citrusy, almost lemon-like, hints with my first taste but I was either imagining things or my taste buds quickly lost that flavor.  This is a highly fermented golden beer.  It was crisp and clear but not outstanding.  My impression is an American pilsner that's much more refined, maybe less rice and adjuncts.","canoehornpoint","Mar 10, 2002"
