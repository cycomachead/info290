Now for the taste, it is rich with with malts and a mild sweetness.  This brew has a nice balance it it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel is is nice and clean.

It is just dull, having said that if you drink it with an Italian meal it does have a better flavour following the meal but not nearly enough to make it interesting. So my advice is either drink this as your accompaniment to an Italian meal or treat it like a Miller, chill it to near zero and drink it quick so you don’t notice the lack of flavour. I also tend to feel that this last point makes this a worrying beer! What I mean by that is best explained by this… imagine if a bunch of rowdy teens get their hands on this. At 4.6% they would be pissed pretty quickly and would just keep on drinking as there is so little flavour it would taste like water even to them.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 18, 2014"

I got started with my usual heavy-handed pour, resulting in a pseudo-cascade, and producing just under three fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with good retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. For the second time today, I feel like I have passed urine that was darker than the beer in my glass. Nose had a grassy, Saaz hops-like aroma. No adjuncts, anyway. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Taste was mildly grassy with a biscuit malt backbone. Not bad, especially for the price point. Finish was semi-dry, rather unobtrusive and fairly pleasant in total.","woodychandler","Jul 18, 2014"

Aftertaste is a little dry. Low carbonation. All in all, it's a beer that you could definitely sit down and watch a game with. Although, nothing to write home about. It's cheap and easy.","NerdLife","Jun 23, 2014"

A light golden amber brew with maybe a half-inch of large white bubbles, a shade darker than many other Euro pales and featuring less doughy sweetness as well. Smells like grain husks and faint grassy hops, less doughy and more malty than its sweeter yet crisper and fruitier countryman Peroni. This one is dry as well but features a more rounded tannic maltiness somewhat like weakly steeped tea, vague lemon rind, some DMS but less than expected, dry stale popcorn, and a metallic tingle in the dry grassy finish. Thin and super fizzy but maybe just a hair thicker than something like Heineken. I did note that the spicy sauce on my pizza brought out some added dry grape and pale malt character. Good example of a food pairing that raises up the beer half of the partnership.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 23, 2014"

Mouthfeel is light and clean, moderate CO2. The only beer I will drink with certain Italian dishes.

Moretti is not trying to be an English Ale or an American West Coast IPA. Moretti is light in color, mouth feel, and flavor with a bit of a German lager and hoppy goodness on swallow. Fairly low IPA, too. But don't compare it to the best of other styles. Moretti is a good lager that goes especially well with Italian food. Don't believe me? Try it with a plate of lasagna and salad or a thin crust pizza - no other beer is a better food pairing.","hoppyserpent","Aug 02, 2013"

I had low expectations coming into this review, but Birra Moretti is actually a fine lager - a damn fine one, in my humble opinion, and a surprisingly solid choice for my 450th review. Normally these Euro lagers are a one-and-done for me, but this is one I could actually see myself purchasing again, and I'd certainly pick it over Peroni or 90% of the other imported lagers that crowd the shelves around here. A justifiable option at its LCBO price point - if you're a lager fan looking for something simple to quaff on a hot day, give this one a shot.","thehyperduck","Jul 14, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, along with an unfortunate extra bit of dust and dirt. Hm. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet, fluid feel. Overall, this is a pretty weak bit of beer, something I'd hope the burgeoning Italian scene is quick to rebuke.","TMoney2591","May 03, 2013"

3.35,15.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,"one of the more available Italian beers, this one is pretty much the pale euro standard, nothing special. it pours a really faded straw looking color with a rapidly rising white head, aided by the pilsner glass im using here. the color is really pale, too light, even for the style, it lets me know not to expect too much taste here. the nose also gives that indication, with just a crystal light malt grassy sort of nose, a little skunky, without any more than basic bittering hops in the finish. the flavor is identical to the nose. I mean, this is plenty drinkable, in fact its really easy down, but there just isn't much taste. not a lot of off flavors, as the skunk has subsided, but its a pretty watered down beer. still, there is something unique about moretti, I don't know if its the yeast or the grains or what, but I can always pick this beer out blind with other similar ones because it has a sort of burnt bread element that stands out. not much else going on. the feel isn't bad, just really light and lacking on alcohol. as such it would be a good all day drinker. the carbonation is also really bright, which makes it good with some heavier foods like pasta and chicken marsala. overall its better than peroni, but a far cry from europe's best.","StonedTrippin","Feb 25, 2013"

The head is thin and pure white with a subtle aroma of malt. The flavor is lightly sweet and malty with a faint finish of bitter. Very nice overall. I had a second. The Moretti reminded me of Heineken, and as I reviewed the label in more detail, there it was, “brewed by Heineken in xxx, Italy”. It’s different enough from Heineken, but there are similarities.

Aroma strong cereal grains, cooked vegetable mild biscuit malt breadiness. Flavor assertive grassy hop flavor compared to most pale lagers, touch of bitterness but some cooked vegetables and cereal grains arises with biscuit malt sweetness. No skunkiness to be had here just some spicy herbal hops in the finish with a touch of sulfur. Mouthfeel is a bit high on the carbonation really tickles the back of the palate all the way up to the nasopharyngeal junction. Drinkability not bad especially when served cold, suitable for a mainstream macro/Euro lager.","WVbeergeek","Mar 23, 2004"

What little bit of a head was left for me quickly vanished into the atmosphere. The aroma offered me a little more in the way of hops and malt than I expected, but it was still somewhat metallic, and the aroma overall was average at best. This Bier drinks rather well though. Light in flavor and light on the palate, I can see this one pairing very well with any number of Italian dishes, and being able to stand up to and cut through just about anything. Not bad.","goindownsouth","Mar 21, 2004"

Pours out to a darkish yellow in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of grains, but it also has a floral smell as well that is really good. This beer, tastewise, reminds me of beers from the Czech Republich, i.e. Budvar, Pilsner Urquell, Rebel,, etc., but might be even more balanced. A very surprising beer and one I will pick up again.","proc","Sep 01, 2003"

The head is a little quick to dissipate to a light, white haze over the surface that I would hesitate to still call the head. Delicate lacing of the glass, and a soft, "clean" smell (if that makes any sence at all; that's the only way I know how to describe it.) The taste is quite good indeed. Likewise, the mouthfeel is also pleasant. This beer isn't at all aggresive, and has a nice finish with a pleasant aftertaste I have trouble describing. As I mentioned before, this is indeed one of my favourite brews and I could drink these light weight Italians all night long. They also go well with Italian cuisine. A nice veal parmesan accompanied by a cool pint of Moretti is quite tasty!","SilentSabre","Aug 31, 2003"

Sweet hay-like aromas, enough sweetness to suggest a decent malt backbone. Simple and straightforward malt flavor of sucrose and husky grain with a bitter nut-skin hop balance. Swallow is a little unsettling, too much carbonation and some vague phenolics that lean on the metallic side. To my mind, too sharp at the close due to the finishing effects.","ADR","Jul 03, 2003"

Its a nice novelty for the first few sips but once that wears off you realize that what you have in your hand is a boring beer.  The taste is nothing really worth commenting on or berating; it's a little bitter with a slight creaminess to it.
