Aroam on opening of pure skunk, with light sweet malt and hints of grassy hops underneath. After sitting in the glass a more typical Euro pale / adjunct light sweet malt and grain aroma. Flavor of subdued sweet malt, starting with faint biscuit malt and developing a bit more sweet malt, finishing light with a hint of hop bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Very lightly flavored, but did not seem watered down, simply lightly malted. The flavors that are present are quite nice, but really does not stand out in any way. A mild, simple pale ale. Good and unobtrusive with a meal. Not my style, but pleasant enough. Green bottle, booo.","LiquidAmber","May 16, 2014"

There is some citric hop flavor at the finish- which is also dry. Overall, its the better of the two Greek beers that i tried but not something I would ever order again.

Aroma smells of cheap beer and some skunk. Flavor is so mild that it's difficult to discern what's there. There's probably some variety of grain, a little alcohol, and maybe some hops. The tongue experiences the carbonation more than anything. One of the lightest beers I've ever tasted, and that's saying something living in a country that's filled to the brim with light beers. This is a rare case where simply trying a single bottle feels like a complete waste of time, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider this might be the case when I bought it.

Poured very clear, mildy yellow, very bubbly. Lots of fizz on top that settled quickly into no head. Lots of carbonation. No lacing to speak of. I took a big whiff and had a hard time getting a real good sense of the smell. Not a bad smell...just very mild. Some sweet aroma, no hops to speak of. The taste was, well, nonexistent. I was really trying to get a good handle on the taste, but it had no taste. I only got a hint of malty sweetness. No aftertaste, no bitterness. Light, fizzy mouthfeel. I suppose this could be considered drinkable because of the very mild flavor and light mouthfeel. I could probably drink a dozen of these with all my facilities fully in check. I suppose I'd drink this again, but not at Disney World prices, which is what I paid because I didn't know any better. *note* - my wife asked why I didn't check BA on my phone before ordering the beer.","mtbbaboon","Oct 30, 2010"

Noticeable amount of malt, and a clean and crisp aftertaste. Mouthfeel was bubbly and smooth. Drinkability gets decent marks in my opinion, as I have had much worse. I think this is a decent choice to pair with a cuisine, better than some Mexican or Asian lagers I have tried to pair with dinner. Definitely preferred this ice cold when it came to the table.
