There was a lingering grain sweetness throughout in the beer that stays nice till the end, no bitterness found in this beer. It tasted of a little rice and pale malt, some grains and a light hop flavour. Very refreshing and clean throughout, I enjoyed this beer.  This beer is pleasant. and perfect for the light beer drinker.  Definitely a top class session beer, perfect for a night out with friends to a restaurant, say perhaps a Korean restaurant!

To be honest, it wasn't much better. It smelled sweet, but it didn't really smell like anything. It had a starchy character with very little flavour. The only note I could discern was that of figs, which made it difficult to enjoy after half of a glass. It was far too sweet for a beer that is supposed to be refreshing and easy to drink in quantity. I've had sweeter beers, but with no other discernible flavour, this beer was cloyingly sweet. And that fig flavour just built up as I drank. At the time, the only alternative was Budweiser, so I continued to drink the Hite, figuring it was probably the lesser of the two evils, but not by much.
