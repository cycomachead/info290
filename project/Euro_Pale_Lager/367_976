The nose is sweetened grain. it has a richness on the nose that is deep. A slight hop herbal grass to sweeten it. It drinks well. Hearty grain, dry and robust with plenty of depth and the hops are accents. They add some sweet herbal grass to the palate for definition and depth. The beer has a medium mouthfeel and is not shy. I would call it forcefull in it's malt stature. The malt is the drink. It's pleasing and leaves with a slight bit of dryness and maybe an earthiness that you could call bitter. This was made by a thai brewer who got his training in Germany and it's evdent in this beer. Tall golden liquid grain with a an enthusiastic and crisp presence.","utopiajane","Jul 17, 2014"

3.23,6.6,3.25,3.25,3.25,3,3.25,"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a medium straw amber with a thin white head that dissipates to a thin ring around the glass with little lacing. Served in a cold glass at a restaurant and allowed to warm up bit before tasting. Mild aroma of sweet malt and a hint of grassy hops; typical Euro pale / adjunct lager. Flavor follows with mild grainy malt with a hint of biscuit and a light grassy hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied. Quite as expected for a light foreign lager, perhaps with slightly more mildly astringent hop bitterness in the finish than the body can support, but overall a nice neutral accompaniment to my Thai meal, even if not something I would buy as a stand alone ale.","LiquidAmber","May 14, 2014"

There's a Caro syrup smell all too reminiscent of an Icehouse Lager, with some clean pale malts and a hint of lemon. Tasting it, I get sweet malt, bland soggy grains, and as it warms up, an extremely bitter metallic taste on the back end. It's no wonder they served this in a frozen pint glass.

Light sugary malt sweetness with a hint of earthy spice. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel.

Pours a light straw color, a bit darker than most adjunct lagers (this is all-malt), with a lot of white foam. Aroma of malty bread, some grassy/herbal noble-type hops and a whiff of skunk. Overall this beer is very malty, grainy, and bitter, with just a little residual sweetness. Sourdough malt predominates but there is a little hop spice and a fairly dextrinous body. There is a hint of apple but the finish is dry and bitter. A classic pale Euro lager flavor and much less sweet than most mainstream examples of the style. Fewer flaws as well, although there is a little metal and skunk on the palate. Great with spicy curries and stir fried chilli and basil chicken, and has more character than its countryman Chang.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 26, 2013"

Heard the original brewers trained under the Guinness Brothers and modeled this beer on Harp, only difference they sourced the ingredients locally in Thailand. Not certain that is true but the beer stands out and I buy it whenever I see it all over the world. In Vietnam, where I live, I gt it delivered 5 cases at a time. It's carried by a single guy on the back of scooter.","Shoffy","Feb 01, 2013"

It makes sense for such a purpose as well- a fairly crisp lager with a rounded flavor from all malt, and a snappy finish- you can actually taste the hops! Really not that bad, especially for a Euro style lager. That being said, I won't get carried away either- it still IS a Eurolager- and not all styles should be treated equally. Some are catch-all categories for - average- beer. This one pours golden with a moderate white head that settles to a thin swirl. Smells grainy and full bodied, with sweetness on the finish. Tastes full bodied and grainy and fairly thick, but with a nice crisp finish, while overall evincing some creaminess. It is what it is, but better than most in the style.","Georgiabeer","Jul 20, 2012"

Medium to light golden in appearance, this lager is darker than most American style lagers. Pour is as you would expect with a good 1-2 finger head. lacing is minimal but apparent. Taste is of slight peach and honey. mouth feel is light-medium, possibly due to the amount of barley used in this brew. A slight sodium-dry finish is felt at the back. All in all this has become one of my favorite lagers, which is a short list. This matches perfectly with Thai food and coconut curry.

Tasted vaguely of unhopped malt with no corn, which was a refreshing difference from American cheapo beers. It was a bit sweet, but once again, not in a corny way. It's definitely a very watery beer. But also VERY refreshing. This is something I could see myself craving on a hot day. More so than Busch or even Sol. This is TRES SMOOTH. Well designed for the tropics of Thailand.

Aroma comes off as German in origin with a grassy herbal hop character sweet lightly toasted 2 row malts and maybe a touch adjuncts in probably rice I'm guessing, along with this I'm getting a spice sweet ginger tone that's just barely noticable but present. Anyway much freakin' better than the "typical" asian macro, the taste is clean flavored crisp lager one gives the balance of light sweetness and herbal hop flavor with low bitterness but mixes well and complements the food so well. Mouthfeel is clean crisp light body with crisp even carbonation very nice.

A few whisps of irish lace, specifically around the rim where the beer reached its peak. The first smell was killer. I actually exlaimed "Yikes! They expect me to drink this?" The second smell wasn't as bad though. Perhaps my nostrils quickly adjusted? Who knows. Sulfur, which is what I believed that first whiff was. Grains, grass and overcooked vegetables. Their is a unique taste to this that I can't quite put my finger on. What is it? I looked through the reviews and none of them seem to ring that bell on what that taste is. Sort of a stale, bitter/sour taste. This soon subsided to a diacetyl, lemon grass taste with a malt backbone. Aftertaste has a hint of that unique taste, but a little less stale. That unique taste, it isn't good I'm sorry to say. It's not terrible, which is about the only good thing I can say about it. The mouthfeel reminds me of sea water. Something I would not choose to drink again. I've had worse beers. However, their is very little I could say that is positive about this beer.

Enter Singha. This is a flavorless, textureless, odorless beer. It's essentially seltzer that also gets you tanked; which can be a very good thing. After eating some really spicy noodles it isn't like you'd be able to really taste much of anything anyway, so it would be a waste to get a Delirium to eat with your spicy pad thai.

This is what American malt liquor should taste like! 6% alcohol by volume helps you feel good fast. Tingly mouthfeel aided by hops and alcohol. Not bad for a big-brewery style beer.

I'm trying as many of the recommended beers on the day they appear and, unfortunately, January 7th was Singha. It looks and smells like a cheap lager, virtually no head and virtually no taste.

It finishes rather unpleasantly. Singha rolls off the tongue quickly, but its aftertaste comes back with a vengenance.

The head that was formed was white in color that lasted only a moment then fell to almost nothing, except a ring on the edges. It did manage to leave some lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of malts, light hops, pepper spice, and some light fruit (plums). The malt and pepper seemed to stand out. The flavors started off with a pepper spice bite then the hops came over my tongue, then as it settled over my tongue I noticed a sweet malt and spicy pepper dominate the flavors as it started to slide down my throat, and finished off with a fruity flavor in the back. The aftertaste was mostly a combination of malty pine with hints of fruit (as it warmed). The body was light to medium. I did notice that when first served cold it had a kind of plastic feel in my mouth that was noticeable but diminished as it warmed. But I also noticed that it became slightly bitter as it became too warm. Over all I would say that it was not a bad beer to drink. I rather liked the spiciness appeal it had to it.

Very smooth, with a slightly astringent sweetness. Not bad, but pretty pedestrian. Team it up with some potent Thai spice, however, and the beer kicks into gear as an ideal salve to sooth a raw tongue. Mutes the fire a bit, and then gets out of the way.","Brent","Dec 07, 2003"

The flavor starts with a sweet grainy malt, then reveals some light hop flavor as it warms in the mouth, and finishes with another touch of hop flavor and a fair amount of bitterness that's bouyed by a sweetish maltiness that sticks in the mouth. The alcohol, which is only listed as 6.0%, is somewhat apparent. Apart from the fact that this is not a complex beer, and coupled with the skunkiness of the aroma (remember a fresh bottle may be clear of that), and the apparent alcohol - this is a very nice, and interesting beer.
