Nose had a certain je ne sais quois - it did not smell like the usual adjunct suspects, but at the same time, it had an unpleasant underlying mustiness. Label check: Bottled 25 March 11 Best by 25 March 12, so I was in the window and it had probably been pasteurized, given its clear bottle, so what was the problem? Mouthfeel was on the thin side and it had a slightly minty flavor on the tongue along with a mild lager sweetness. This was quickly shaping up to be a whole buncha nothin'!

Big notes of canned corn, .powered sugar, and grains. The flavor is really sweet but not in a obnoxious way. It reminds me of powdered sugar and sweet corn. Slight graininess with just a hint of musty hops. Crazy as it is, there is absolutely no hint of skunk. This bottle has probably been sitting on the shelve for a while in a clear bottle but no funk. Man, you put a Heineken on the shelf in front of a tinted window for 5 minutes and you start getting a little funk. I wonder if they use some sort of hop oil that doesn't skunk, like Miller does.

Fairly average smell too, weak malt, and it seemed a bit sweet to me as well. It tastes like many other of the more easily available Euro Pale Lagers out there, but amazingly, it had no skunk, quite surprising for a beer in a clear bottle. Specifically, it's a bit sweet, and is very smooth. The mouthfeel is alright, pretty light and a bit watery, the carbonation is good however. This beer is quite drinkable, at least if you want something boring and fairly bland. If you want to have a really good Russian beer, I'd recommend the Baltika #6 Porter.","67cuda","Oct 30, 2005"

It's light and clean on the finish; an easy drinker. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a typical golden lager, nothing special.
