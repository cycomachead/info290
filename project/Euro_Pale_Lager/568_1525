Nothing bad so far. The taste is sweet, but this brew has a smooth finish. You pick up on some grains in the taste of this brew. To me this brew is like an American Lager. Mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is no bad aftertaste.. Browar Okocim S.A. did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. This brew was better than what I was expecting.

3.55,3.5,4,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting lager - earthy overall is a good way I would describe this beer, but definitely something that works in large servings. A 500mL bottle is a good serving size for this beer. Nothing so strong in flavor that you tire of it, but at a weakness in flavor that you need a whole bottle to really get to know it. Then again, I suspect a beer like this has been crafted solely to drink in large quantities with food. I did not have this with food, but I can see that it would go really well with a wide range of meat & potato dishes, probably some heartier vegetable dishes as well. So nicely drinkable, but overall nothing amazing. Nice looking color though. Strangely, like the bottle says, it's an OK beer.","damndirtyape","Dec 08, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of odd fruitiness and an aftertaste laden with the dust of many unkempt attic rooms. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

Pours a crystal clear golden color with a decent sized white head that dissipates quickly to a cap. After airing out a bit the skunk is still in the room, but maybe my nose is used to the smell a bit because I can find some bready pils and a hint of flowers. The flavor is a bit better than the aroma advertised. Nice sweet bready malt presence with a hint of graininess. There's a firm spicy hop bit that provides a great balance to the malty sweetness. Carbonic acid is a bit high and does detract a bit. Medium body with a sweet bubbly mouthfeel and a moderate level of carbonation. Not a bad brew after it airs out a bit.","johnnnniee","May 03, 2013"

Comparatively, historically, sure, but for the style - negits. Nose was pure, unadulterated lager. A slight, malt-driven sweetness led the way, but there were also Noble hops as the back-up. Mouthfeel was thin-to medium and I got a slight metallic tang on the tongue along with the initial wash of malty sweetness. Oh well.

Taste is again crisp, grassy but really more of a bright and slightly sweet beer. I really wish the spiciness of the nose remained in the taste but instead it becomes a bit washed out and muted in the sweeter, maltier aspects of this beer, I mean its there but I almost wish it were overstated.

Sweeter, less hoppy, Also, while ithis doesn't taste "old" it's missing that fresh taste that I'm used to from more local brews and careful date checking. Mouthfeel is carbonated, medium bodied for a pale lager. Overall its truly O.K. beer. I prefer a pils, which this is not and was hoping for a score for my fridge here but it was a miss.

There's a pleasant hop profile here that is a bit out of the ordinary, but I enjoyed it. You never experience a grain/corn quality to the taste, and it's not skunky at all (unlike many light Euro beers). The finish is smooth, clean, and has a pleasant aftertaste. To be honest this is a fantastic session beer that I'd love to find more of. Certainly the best Euro pale lager I've had to date, and a great alternative to the macro Euros.","BBM","Apr 02, 2007"

The taste was crisp, and clean, classic lager, grainy malted taste, slight hint at the european hops. Very smooth and a classic session beer. Overall it was ok(lol).

Although the lacing disappeared as the beer was consumed. The aroma is pretty strong for a beer that may initially come off as being possibly weak in stature. Nose is full of strong polish hops with just a tiny hint of sweetness and alcohol. Smells like a strong pilsner, actually. The taste starts out with the same hops in the aroma. I can imagine that some folks might find this flavor to be a little stringent. The hops get stronger as the flavors spread through the palate, then in comes some sweetness and a little bit of alcohol. Finishes pretty dry with a slight biscuity aftertaste. Overall, a very smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation presence. Nice. Now, this beer may seem not too drinkable at first, and I wasn't able to test out my theory. However.

More pilsner malt comes forth in the taste than the aroma. I have to admit, its much better than expected, and certainly better than just okay.

Unusual herbal, minty, medicinal hops give this beer a twist from the ordinary fizzy yellow lager.

Malt picks up a little mid-palate, accompanied by a moderate warming taste of alcohol, and is finished with a somewhat unusual and astringent hop bitterness. Very well-carbonated and light in the mouth. Best cold, but definitely one of the better pilsners presently produced by the Fatherland. Na Zdrowie!","mzwolinski","Nov 30, 2002"
4.03,17.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Boston area I can get it for less than $2 a 500 ml bottle, a six pack of the stuff in NYC is about $12. Needless to say I like buying it in Beantown. Perky white lace and a good golden clarity, clean aroma with a whiff of hops and sweet malt. Superb crispness with a dry malt character that brings a bready flavour to the palate, clean in the mouth with a quick snappy bite of hops that linger into the after taste. One of my favourite Euro lagers.","Jason","May 25, 2002"
