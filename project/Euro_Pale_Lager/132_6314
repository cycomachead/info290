3.84,6.7,4,3.75,3.75,4,4," The taste is veery nice with creamy malt and light hop with floral sweet quality and mild yeast adding a creamy taste with mild hop bitterness to balance the malt sweetness which is toasty and light with a low alcohol flavor if any in the taste mostly herbal hops in the finish. Overall excellent lager in the general sense a bit generic however it is slightly more hop flavored than your average 'Harp' or whatever is sold as Irish Lager. Very drinkable yet still has a goodly amount of flavor for a 4.6% lager and it fits the style well.","Slatetank","Feb 23, 2015"

Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, grass, and slight fruity flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty, but the smell on this one is slightly better in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 06, 2014"

Aroma a bit grassy, but couldn't pick up too much else due to the improper pour. Taste of cereal grains, biscuity. Nothing complex or layered to my palate.

Aromas of toasted grains and a slightly sour, floral highlight. Flavors are light, but sharp, with the toasty grains/cereal giving a good, solid backbone that support the sour tang and bitter hops at the end of the palate. The carbonation ends up giving a sharp, almost astringent feel along with the flavor profiles. The aftertaste is bitter and slightly sour, leading to a resiny, slick, and lingering finish.

The taste of the beer is sweet, not in a gross way but sweet like a wheat ale or something like that. The mouthfeel is thin on this one but it's supposed to be so I'm not being too critical on this.

God knows Rogue doesn't use any freshness info on their bottles, this was bought in season approaching St. Paddy's Day. Really a beer I've drank on tap and bottle in the past but have never written down any thoughts on it. APpearance is simple fizzy yellow beer at first site, but then you notice a slight haze to the straw golden body. Actual hop haze going on with a creamy texture fluffy white head that sticks around for awhile. Lacing is the same forms intricate chunky layers that add to the eye candy. Aroma has a mild rolling layer of citrus/herbal/grassy mild skunky hop notes going on. A nice dose of cereal grains backing up the malt profile. Flavor is a nice mix of malts and hops some would consider this boring, I think it proves what great brewers they have at Rogue this is a simple style flavor wise but extremely tough to brew. There's no hiding any sulfur or off flavors like diacetyl in this one. This is a well brewed clean crisp drinking beer, with herbal grassy hops from their own supply and no Pac Man yeast to create the typical Rogue house flavor. A touch of green apple tartness in the finish, but really a nice grassy/bready biscuit malt layer going on. Nothing off putting completely easy drinking experience, medium to light bodied lager carbonation is lively definitely doesn't fall flat, probably one of the better lagers widely available from a craft brewer.

Smell was ll grain with a touch of euro hops, but mostly your classic light lager smell. The flavor was actually more then decent which suprised me. A nice crisp clean feel gave way to more then a decent swelling a grain and hops with hints at cereals and fresh cut grass. A long subtle and dried out finish only served to add on to this one and really make a great overall impression on me. It went down like water and I was suprised at just how drinkable this one was.

Medium-bodied, has good bite while still smoothing out into a balanced presentation and clean finish. The mineral water, iron notes persist, more breadiness and less corn and malt sweetness. Conversely, the peach, apricot, apple fruit elevates some. The carbonation puts an attractive charge into things, not close to watery. Orange and lemon citrus takes up some ground.

Taste was okay, kind of like a gourmet Budwiser if that's possible. It's probably one of the better Euro Pale Lagers, as I think most of the beers produced by Rogue are great.

A light yellow-golden hue, almost butnot quite clear, with a white head that shrunk leaving a wispy centre and slow steady carbonation, several small-bubble centres spread across the top of the beer - that's encouraging! Smell of wet grass - of Ireland of course - with a mild citrus nose. I really like the taste of this beer: clean and crisp but with enough mild bitterness (28 IBU's) and understated malt to give it flavour. There is also a citrus or green apples backdrop that makes it refreshing and, although the body is on the light side, it has enough complexity to distinguish it from your run-of-the-mill lager. The second pour rustled up a thicker white head than the first and with a bit of lacing. I noticed that while the beer eventually settled down, it still had a carbonation pulse, slow but steady, a string or two of bubbles continued to make their way slowly to the top of the glass. A very easy drinking brew overall and a great sessional at 4.8 per cent ABV, just the ticket for today. Happy St. Patrick's Day everyone!","ThatWineGuy","Mar 17, 2009"

The malts are light in body and well-developed in the beer, meaning a large amount was used in the brew. There is a hop presence too, adding a bit of citrus to the mouthfeel.

Hopping is very low, but a touch of herbal flavor is noted throughout.

Spiced with English hops for an earthy and lightly grainy note. Aromas transition to flavors really well, throw in a solid bready, yeasty flavor with a new honey-like sweetness.

4.53,25.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"From the recent 2006 production, Kells pours a beautiful 14K gold color with a rich-robust frothy head. The nose is of clean natural malt, un-roasted and fresh with a magnificent floral character, quite upfront when agitated in the glass with no ulterior or radical aromas emanating from within. This brew is quite focused and intense to the point of total balance. The sterling hops used in this product, the only variety of hops, perfectly accompanies the whole, with a very subtle yet focused and specific nose as the result of using this single variety of hops. You can really consider the brewmasters task in finding the quintessential variety to work with to reach this end. The mouthfeel is unbelievably soft and subtle, like liquid velvet; perhaps low mineral content in the water. Taste is ever-so-slightly bitter, very creamy and understated, with just enough residual sweet malt to finish. This brew would be a perfect accompaniment to a meal of fish, chicken, cream sauces or a vegetarian dish. The drinkability is off the scale, as this easy-going yet all so satisfying brew can be drunk endlessly. This is not a blow your doors off beer, the finesse and excellence are revealed in the fine tuned subtlety of this creation.

The hops seem to have a slight edge in the flavor, but not much. Finish is fairly dry, refreshing.","johnrobe","Feb 27, 2003"
3.5,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The archetypal pour for the lager style a crystalline gold, the head portly in size, creamy in its consistency, a brilliant white, and as it erodes leaves behind a thick clinging sheet of lace to conceal the glass. The aroma of barley, freshly toasted, sweet, clean and a real treat for the senses. As for the start, you guessed it malt, sweet and the top middling in its mouth feel. Modestly acidic, the hops apropos to the style, dry and long lasting aftertaste, quite drinkable and a real thirst quencher irregardless the time of year.","Gusler","Jan 14, 2003"
4.08,13.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: A firm but raw lager, flavourful and rich. Coming from and ale brewery this is a damn good beer, I’d pick this over most pale lager of this sort.","Jason","Nov 12, 2002"
4,11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"According to the bottle, brewed by Rogue for the Kells Irish Pub.  Not at all an Irish red, which is usually the incarnation most Irish lagers show up in - this is a good, bull bodied blond lager.  Sweet and fresh in the nose, with a mild caramel blanced nicely by somewhat tart hopping.  Finish is very clean with a touch of alcohol clearing out the caramel - good session brew.","Brent","Oct 27, 2002"
3.68,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Usually turned off by this style, I thought I'd give this beer a try solely based on the fact that it's a Rogue... I wasn't disappointed. It poured a pleasant, light golden hue and was complemented with a decent bubbly head. There was a hint of hops in the nose, and the taste featured a nice balance of Saaz-like hops and malt. Pretty smooth and creamy in the mouth and very easy to consume, this would make a quality session beer.","Jon","Sep 28, 2002"
