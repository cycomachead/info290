Probably a step up from LaBatt and Molson Canadian (though I've not tried either of those), but not notably so.","Beric","Jun 27, 2013"
3.52,12.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a tall boy into a true pint, the beer is a bright, yellow-gold coloring with a ton of carbonation bubbling through the body and a thin, frothy, bright white head. Nose of toasted grains, floral hops, and a touch of honey sweetness. Flavors of toasted bread, honey and caramel subtle sweetness, and a pepper spiced and floral hops character at the end of the palate. Very balanced and very clean. The aftertaste is roasty and bitter, with some buttery highlights. Clean, smooth finish, which is slightly effervescent due to the carbonation. Decent, and very drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Jun 18, 2013"

3.25,3.8,3,3,3,3.5,4,"Had on tap at an Irish bar in Toronto (Flynn's or something, can't remember the bar name). Overall this was a disappointing drink, not unlike any number of macro lagers as I will attempt to qualify: The beer is clear as water, lpale yellow hue, thin white head. The smell is muted and neutral, mainly malt. Very mild flavor, hops are present only in a meager bitterness, malt is minimal, nothing offensive but nothing compelling. I don't want to be overly critical so I'll note that this has good carbonation and is not hard to drink. I wouldn't have actually ordered it if not for the paltry nature of the other selections.","TurdFurgison","Dec 05, 2008"

4.4,40.6,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Well, this is truely a gem of a beer from Toronto! It reminds me alot of Brick's Red Baron, anyway onto the review! Beautiful golden yellow color, with a 1-2 inch head, that sinks down to a .5 inch head, and leaves rings of laceing all down the glass. Smell is great, smells really fresh, malts, and nice hop aroma. Wicked. Taste, well I really like these Blonde Lagers, like really like them. So to me this is perfect. Goes down smooth, carbonated, with a nice crisp hop finish, with little after taste. Great. Mouthfeel is full, carbonated, and satisfying. Drinkability is through the roof, when cold these can be consumed in excessive quantities, and even when warm still very drinkable. Overall my secong favorite blonde lager, next to Red Baron. If you liked that beer, you will definatly like this beer! this is HIGHLY reccommended!","steeler","Jul 27, 2008"

2.78,-11.2,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with a big pure white foamy head with medium retention and no lacing. Aroma if quite refreshing with a light sweet malt profile. Taste is also quite one-dimensional with some medium sweet malt and very subtle floral notes. This beer was as easily drinkable as it is easily forgettable.","Phyl21ca","Apr 20, 2008"
3.05,-2.6,3,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,"This is the type of beer that's a welcome switch from traditional bland macros, but the bite of the taste leaves something to be desired and I couldn't see myself downing a lot of these in a row. Pretty much a by-the-numbers European lager.","atomicbolt","Mar 04, 2008"
3.41,8.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I tried this beer on October 28, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The bottle poured a very nice translucent gold into the glass witrh a very loose frothy head thad disappeared quickly. The aroma is mildly hoppish with citrus tones.

3.18,1.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Smells and tastes similar to a macro but with a bit more hops and sweetness from the malt.

3.55,13.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Last of a six-pack brought over by a friend a couple of months ago. Although not a lot stands out in this beer, notable items for the style (at least around here) are a) lack of any adjunct flavours, and b) a really solid body and smooth mouthfeel. Other than that, a good, straightforward light-tasting lager that's widely available in Toronto, and therefore often a good option next to the macro selections.","crwills","Feb 04, 2006"
3.2,2.2,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is hoppier than expected from the nose, which is a pleasant surprise. Malt is subdued and well-balanced with a light roasted character.

2.43,-22.4,3,2.5,2,2.5,3,"Clear, light gold colour topped by a short, white head that lasts about halfway through the pint and produced no lace. Smells of light malt and citrus hops.

3,-4.2,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured a honey color with a white head that didn't stick around too long. Smell is barely of yeast and a bit of hops. Very clean, considering.

I could also hammer tacks underneath my fingernails, but that would be more exciting.","jlervine","0"
