3.67,43.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"25cl brown bottle purchased in Spain and brought back by my father. Pours a crystal-clear straw yellow body with not a whole lot of head to speak of. Smells faintly sweet, fruity, bready, with hints of cooked vegetable. Bread with hints of apple, pear, caramel, with a noticeable herbal hop presence. Hints of butter and cooked vegetable toward the finish. Easy-drinker. Light bodied with moderate to full (but not overly done) carbonation. Not as clean as it could be for the style, but the flavors, while a bit subdued, are noticeable and harmonious. I actually like it.","MrHurmateeowish","Oct 06, 2010"

2.16,-15.6,3,2,2,2,2.5,"Few aromas on the nose, a very important carbonation that gives the body enough sparkling. As far as taste, we feel the grain but without much conviction, just like a beast european-style lager and so it remains watery.

3.1,21.1,3,3,3,3,3.5,"I've had a hard day teaching electrical fault finding to 15 students and this is the beer I've choosen to chill with. It is refrfeshing and pleasant enough and you can just about feel the 5.4% ABV within it. No huge flavours or tastes though, just a run of the mill Euro pop sort of beer. I've drank it many times on Spanish Islands (Ibiza and Formentera) and have never had any problems with it, ideal for quenching a thirst on a hot day, but not a 'must have at all costs' sort of thing. Better than average, but only just.","BlackHaddock","Nov 14, 2009"

2.71,5.9,3,2,3,2.5,3,"I had this on-tap in Barcelona and was more pleased with the result than I thought I would be. It pours a hazy, sort of yellowish type of color with a fizzy head and give off almost no smell at all. I was able to detect the maltiness afterwards, but it never left any adverse taste in my mouth. I would try this again, but only if I could find it on-tap.","germanbeer1","Apr 26, 2008"
2.95,15.2,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a solid, dense, bright white head that fades quickly leaving a few specs of lace. The pale yellow beer holds a few streams of carbonation. Aroma of a nice Pils. It's a mix of light malt sweetness and herbal hops. The pale malt sweetness is a bit overpowering and the mild hop bite doesn't stand a chance. There is a faint stale grain flavor that tarnishes the flavor, and the beer has a kind of corn sugar tasting finish. The mouthfeel is simply average. It is too sweet, and there are some faint off flavors that bring this beer down. It's a not-so-good Pilsner, which I guess is what makes it a Euro Pale Lager.","HappyHourHero","Apr 17, 2008"
2.85,11.3,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"I tried this beer for the sake of trying it going in without any high expectations. Had it iced cold in a pint glass. Poured a bubbly plale yellow color with a fast fizzing head. Smelled of mild hops and a little sweetness. Taste was thin and barely hopped with a touch of citrus. An OK beer to sip on a hot day but don't go nuts.","Portertime","Beers"

2.48,-3.1,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Pours a white frothy head with a good lacing. Most of the head diminishes rather quickly, but about 3 mm head remains. Clear yellow, sparkling body. Fairly weak aroma, just like many other mass produced pale lagers. The initial flavor is a little bit sweet, but it soon turns into a more bitter flavor. It doesn't taste of that much, apart from this slight bitter taste. Light to medium body with a dry texture.","kRaa","Oct 31, 2007"
2.36,-7.8,3,2,3,1,2,"Overall - I must admit that the initial taste wasnt too bad, however it was followed by a horrible acidity, characteristic of many mass produced lagers. A one dimensional beer with many flaws but at least the taste is better than some of the other "macrolagers". It would take a pub with a really poor selection to force me onto this lager.","DaveUK","Oct 13, 2007"

3.16,23.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Sampled a few bottles of this brew in northern Italy. It's a yellow-golden liquid with a thin head. Nicely, the head presents a thin and soapy sheen of lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is uninteresting. A bit of grain, and some malt in the nose, but not much else. It clearly smells a step above typical macro swill, but the aroma is faint and uninteresting. The tast is a bit better. Sweet, with a little malt and bread up front. The finish has a little corn, and a bit of a cereal adjunct flavor as well. Light mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable. This one is not half bad.","Suds","Aug 31, 2007"

3.28,28.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"San Miguel Especial Â Euro Pale Lager, 5.4%. Ubiquitous in southern Spain, this review is based on a sampling on tap from the el Rancho restaurant at the Marina del Sol resort outside Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol. A can I saw later listed corn as an ingredient. Comes out clear solid gold, perhaps a shade or two darker than standard, under a one finger white head that looks thin but lasts remarkably long and leaves excellent sheets of lace most of the way down the glass. The nose is full of sweet barley malt, tainted ever so slightly by the corn and with a touch of hops spice. The mouth is light and very prickly. The flavor is pretty standard, with malt up front more bready than corny. A pretty decent hop bite follows, leaving a good mixed finish and an enticing aftertaste. I expected horrible, and got pretty respectable.","Globetrotter","0"
