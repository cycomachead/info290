This beer actually looks more like a cider...but certainly has the aroma of a beer. Sweet malts dominate the aroma, with a hint of wet dirt...the combination of which actually works well. Its taste was sweet light malts up front, with a hint of wet dirt that disappears almost instantly, and a mildly bitter finish which lingered for a few seconds. I would describe Tatra as a smooth beer, easy drinking and light bodied, though with a bit of a thin mouthfeel to it. In summary, a decent beer most notable for that unique 'wet dirt' aroma and taste (not a bad thing in this case), but not memorable enough that I would buy it again. It was interesting enough that I will try some other Polish beers though. Tatra is reasonably priced at $1.90 per 500 ml can.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Mar 10, 2014"

While there, I found that the only beer available was lager and lager, and occasionally, dark lager. I liked the beer prices in Poland and liked how I could pick up a few brews from the supermarket (being from Canada, we can only buy liquor in liquor stores). This one was something I picked up as an alternative to the Zywiec I normally drank, and I was glad I did. It poured a decent light yellow and it smelled really quite sweet, but not off-putting. I drank it from the pint glass I had in my concrete, Communist flat and I enjoyed its sweet nectar as it flowed nicely. I had another just to make sure, but this is one I would probably pick up from my local liquor store just for the nostalgia. It won't change anyone's life, but it will make you happy you tried something different.","zachloveshisbeer","Jan 01, 2013"

And settled it did, it was down to a wispy film and minimal lacing after a third consumed and then only slight carbonation. Smell was distinctly corn-inspired with a wet grassy aroma. Taste was much more malt than hops, very macro-lager but not offensive. Mouthfeel was a bit dull and the finish abrupt. I can't say there was nearly enough of a bitter presence, something was missing that might have made this a finer beer experience. Still, it was quite acceptable overall and would likely go down even better if one were kicking back in an outdoor patio in central Krakow or overlooking the mountain vistas in Zakopane and could follow it with a Zywiec Porter.

2.77,-9.8,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,"The aroma is very true to type with grainy malt and grassy almost herbal hops. The appearance is pale gold with an average head. The taste is also true to type and matches the aroma almost exactly. The aftertaste is clean. The palate is thin but OK for the style. Overall it's a pretty average beer but not "Beer With Character."","nick76","Oct 14, 2008"

3.6,17.3,3,3,4,3,4,"Crisp and clean tasting, light malt, some dry corn, a little tartness, and a mild hop bite in the finish. Bubbly carbonation but made for a thirst quenching brew. Overall a decent Pilsener that got the job done, not outstanding but nothing to really complain about.","lehows","Aug 22, 2005"

2.58,-16,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"a big head vanished into thin air as soon as the glass hit my tableno lacing, no foamy film. nuthin. really weak malt and no hop character to speak of. i suppose it's possible i got a watery pour, but this was pretty disappointing. it fell short of a few of of the BJCP guidelines for a czech pils (not that this should always guide one's opinion)","bruachan","Nov 25, 2004"
4.13,34.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1" white head above the clear light golden brew. Head is frothy and lasts well, with delicate lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet, with a pervasive spiciness. Taste is smooth malt pale sweetness, with a crisp, spicy hops character. Mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying for the style, which sometimes seems watery, but not this one, and drinkability is superb. If you see one, try it out.","ppoitras","Beers"
3.78,23.1,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Aside from a rather thinnish body, this is a pretty nice pilsner. I'd place it more in the bohemian/czech style, with the soft roundness of flavor, but again, it could use body and a bit more malt presence. The bitterness is great, but the malt contributes very little flavor, especially in the finish. I actually enjoyed the flaws, the esters and phenols that contributed some extra fruitiness and clove-y notes. The high(-ish) alcohol may have something to do with that. I like it for what it is, rather than looking at it technically. A flawed, but good pilsner. I'd recommend it.","UnionMade","0"
