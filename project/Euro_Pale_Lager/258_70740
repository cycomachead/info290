2.93,10.6,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"On tap at an Italian chain restaurant. Comes to the table a clear straw yellow color with a decent off white head that leaves spotty lacing. Smells of grainy malt a light floral hops. The flavor is as lackluster as the aroma. Light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Barely better than a Bud, but technically defect free, unless you consider a lack of flavor a flaw.","johnnnniee","Jul 08, 2012"

2.11,-20.4,3,2,2,2.5,2,"Not much nose, strong taste watery. It's actually very close to water but with a bitter-sweet side unpleasant. The bitterness in the finish is, it, dirty and artificial, which does not give value to the ordinary lager. Persistent non-existent. Not much to put under the tongue, even if we take into account that this is just a classic lager.","ThaCreep","0"
