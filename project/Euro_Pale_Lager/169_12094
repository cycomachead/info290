It poured golden, was cloudy, with a soapy head, and lots of carbonation. It tasted like any other massed pale ale, with a watery taste, little edge, low alcohol content, and not filling.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Mar 01, 2014"

I find it acceptable in the same circumstances as other pale lagers, however it is not something I prefer by any means. While leagues ahead of domestic counterparts, I feel that Stella Artois is a Budweiser or Corona of Europe. If you're expecting complexity, this is not a good beer for you- it is simple, thin, crisp, and sparkly.","emd","May 22, 2013"

The taste, however, is where this brew fails miserably. Approaching the average aspects of its presentation otherwise (appearance, nose), one would expect something smooth with little to write home about. Frankly, I expected this beer to be drinkable. The flavor is so off it makes me wonder what they used to brew it, it couldn't have been barley for I can't find a hint of those flavors. The hops are no where to be seen, tasted, or smelled.
