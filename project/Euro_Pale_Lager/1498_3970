I like the fact that it has a frothy head that lingers and leaves intermittent ridges of lacing. It far less skunky than the average Euro, so you can actually smell and taste the hops. It's light on the palate, nicely carbonated, and very consistent, regardless of how it's served. C'est une biere delicieuse.","Bunman3","Mar 11, 2015"

With all that in mind I needed a drink that would suit a session so the guests could drink it all day; be refreshing in the heat and suit a lot of different tastes while not being too over powering. I tried a lot of different beers that were available to me in the area and this one came out on top for me. It suited the eclectic taste of the French guests, the crisp pilsner like tastes of the Dutch and the darker hoppy taste of the British and Irish. This was not completely perfect but it was more than good enough to keep everyone happy. That about says it all, this beer is an awesome all-rounder and I have very fond memories of it every bottle now takes me on a magical memory journey and as we live in the UK Iâ€™m pleased to say this beer travels well.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 25, 2014"

OCCASION: Willow Lake orientation day...APPEARANCE: cascading bubbles round out a clear golden body; thick white head--exhibits excellent white cloudy lacing... AROMA: fragrant Saaz with soft lemongrass and some wheat yeasts--fresh and energizing (and unexpected)... PALATE: soft, almost creamy champagne-like (unavoidable comparison?) and smooth; light, clean, dry aftertaste... TASTE: a bit maltier than anticipated; refreshing with some fruitiness and honey accents... OVERALLL: a surprisingly strong profile for a beer--a French beer, at that--I had long forgotten since our trip abroad in '03..this beer poured fresh, presented well, cleansed the palate as a pilsner is apt to do, and offered just enough flavor to elicit a satisfied night....","dacrza1","Jun 30, 2014"

3.34,4.7,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,"For his first sampling of a French beer, Bucky selected Kronenbourg 1664 ("1664"). The beer came in a 500 ml can with a best before date of May 2014 printed on the bottom, and was 5.0% alcohol by volume. 1664 poured an absolutely clear golden colour with some large, slow rising carbonation bubbles visible. Pouring produced about 1" of bubbly, white head that faded to a thin collar of foam and patchy film within 2 minutes. The retreating foam left some modest lacing behind. This is certainly a good looking beer. Its aroma was of sweet, light malts with hop undertones. I see on the list of ingredients that the beer is made with hop extract...the first time I've seen this in a beer. The beer's taste was sweet caramel malts up front followed immediately by a secondary burst of sweetness, finishing with a mild hop bitterness which lingered as a noticeable, but unobjectionable aftertaste. 1664 was light bodied, had a typical level of carbonation and a bit of a thin mouthfeel. Essentially, this is very similar to, though slightly sweeter than, most European lagers. An inoffensive but uninspiring brew. 1664 sells for $2.60 per 500 ml can...a bit on the pricey side given its run-of-the-mill profile.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 17, 2014"

Aroma nondescript, a sour breadiness, sparkly white grape, maybe a hint of bubblegum. Beer is overly carbonated, making it difficult to nail down the flavors. I got pale malt, dilute lemonade and red sour berry notes, and a floral tang ... Not sure where the hop extract used in this beer hails from but there was a distinct floral top note that added some interest to an otherwise dull Euro industrial lager. Harsh metallic flavors and a bit of skunk, albeit less of the latter than comparable beers. I'd drink this before Heineken but alas that is damning via faint praise.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 01, 2013"

The aroma is mostly malt. The flavor is spot on Moosehead, with layered malts up front and a smooth finish. Text book Canadian Lager. Why is this? Well, the French did settle eastern Canada, so is what I think of as a Canadian style beer really a French style beer?","iSip","Sep 05, 2012"

The body is light to medium. The taste is grassy, slightly malty, and clean at the finish. The green bottle makes it weaker than it otherwise could be.","puboflyons","Jun 25, 2012"

It pours a clear very pale straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises rice husk, light funky wheat, and hard water. The taste holds notes of funky wheat, rice, hard water, chalk, and what seems like fake lemon creeping in from some dank room in the back o' the place, ax in hand. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I'm still not a fan of this beer: The supposedly arrogantly quality hops don't come through very well, and things just taste super watery and super adjunct-y (if that makes sense).","TMoney2591","Jan 20, 2012"

Taste is of sweet grains, grassy/hay notes, and an herbal hop bitterness on the finish. The bitterness is pretty mild and fades from the palate after each sip. I am also getting a slightly metallic taste. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel.

There's still that light sweet grain, but there's some honey and a little bit of spice, too. Just a touch of clove, maybe. The mouth feel is fuller than similar beers. Really good lacing, too.

Caramel and loads honey meet up with a fresh lemon-thyme quality, carnations, and even a bit of parsley. The off-aromas fade over time to make this rather nice to smell. Firm and full-flavored, with a bready malt quality and a nice smack of citrus hops. Very good except for an intrusive metallic twinge and a bit of soapy astringency. A bit heavy on the palate; carbonation is airy, but the body is sodden and thick.

A nice crisp clean feel gave way to more then a decent swelling a grain and hops with hints at cereals and fresh cut grass.

4.07,27.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This then would be the blue label 5% abv version, in that slick green bottle which I think is a nice touch. It's a clear golden in colour, a fizzled out head that's not even worth mentioning, really. Crisp grain and honey on the nose, backed by floral grassy hops. Flavour also possesses that crisp grain/bready character, rounded out nicely with light herbal hops. Smooth and crisp, it has a thirst-quenching mouthfeel, very easily made into a session ale, and one of my new favorite lagers. I'm pretty impressed, as I'd sampled this first a year ago and it never left much of an impression on me at the time. It is what it is, and that would be a clean drinkable lager with some character.","IronDjinn","Jan 05, 2004"
3,-6,3,3,3,3,3,"This is a review of the UK brewed, canned version of this stuff. It loses points on appearance as I drank it straight from the can. The aromas are all adjuncts, and grains, with some slight floral hops and light bready malts in the mix. The taste is exactly like the aromas hint....grainy! The mouthfeel is very light and watery, and the drinkability is not the best. This is a great euro-lager in bottles in the US, but in cans in the UK, it is no better than bud!","francisweizen","Dec 19, 2003"

Some bitter hops to the aftertaste but nothing to get really excited about. Very thin and almost too close to watery for my taste. I'm not too crazy about this beer.

The aroma is a little grassy but some malts are detectable as well. There is a faint sweetness as well. This one drinks a whole lot easier than expected. I expected it to be somewhat skunky since that's my experience with French beers - but it was very good. Drinkability was good and the mouthfeel was very pleasing.

There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly light and grassy, with a bit of hops. The taste starts malty, and just a little bit grassy, and ends with a crisp hop bite. Not bad for a lager. The mouthfeel is a little light and oily. The drinkability is fairly good though. A nice solid pale lager.","SheepNutz","Sep 25, 2003"

Served in a 16 oz. can, this brew poured a golden pilsner-like color with a very large head. Aroma was pretty skunky - either this went bad on the trip over or it just smells bad all the time. However, no skunk in the taste, basically just a low quality rice beer flavor with a little sweetness from the middle through the finish. Not bad, but not something to stuff your suitcase full of on the way back to the states - thats for sure. One of the best features about this beer - for both my sake and for the brewer's sake - is the ABV","nixhecks","Jul 26, 2003"

2.54,-20.4,4,2.5,2,3,3,"Clear bright gold appearance, big-bubbled and fizzy head that powers down in about 40 seconds but leaves nice and delicate lace. Sulfur aroma, right up there with a St. Pauli Girl, also a sense of grassiness. Simple malt profile, but with an off note of white vinegar. What puts me off is an unsettling finish, a combination of too much carbonation and a leafy cilantro herbiness. With a world of beer out there, I have no intention of drinking this again. Looks nice, though.","ADR","Jun 13, 2003"
4.07,27.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a very clear golden color. The big fluffy white head fell quick and left a nice lace on the glass. I really liked the smell of this beer Â– It has a pungent lemon/grassy hop aroma to it. The beer is highly carbonated and has a light body. There is an oiliness left in the back of the throat. Somewhat reminiscent of maybe BallantineÂ’s XXX Ale. Finishes well, easy to drink. Not bad.","pezoids","Jun 09, 2003"
3.48,9.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"One of my friends fathers buys this stuff by the case so I decided I had to try it. First off, interestingly shaped bottle, but it could do without being green. Never a good sign. It poured straw yellow with a fair sized head that was retained for a long time. Probably around two thirds of the glass. The smell was a tad bit swillybut there was some sweetness and complexity that I did not expect. The taste was a little too sweet for my liking, I think I could feed hummingbirds. The consistency was a little thin as well. Overall I cannot complain. The bottle decieves you, but it tastes more like some Belgian pales than most swill you would find in a green bottle.","GreatPondBrewer","May 27, 2003"

Aroma is light, with a corn smell and lacking any hops. Mouthfeel is very wet and soft, with a thin body, making it very easy to drink. Carbonation is mild. Taste is light, fruity at times, with a corn beginning, a pale/munich malt middle, a champagne-like yeastiness, and a very mild bittering hop finish with a dry mouthfeel. Decent, and easy to drink, but not very distinct.","Mitchster","Apr 27, 2003"

4.03,26.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This lager from Strasbourg, France has some German influence, though with its own dry French twist. Lively pale gold in color with a fluffy snow-white head light. The edgy raw maltiness balances nicely with a semi-wild and raw resinous hoppiness. Fair floral hop nose. Great beer for a hot summer day! Think BeckÂ’s but less metallic taste, less sulfur in the nose and a tad more noticeable alcohol whiff. The French can brew good beer!","BeerResearcher","Mar 22, 2003"
3.85,20.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The green glass bottle with the large & fancy neck label pours a clear golden/amber with a short-lived, big-bubbled head that drops readily to a thin collar. It leaves a decent amount of lace upfront, but retains less-and-less as you progress through the glass. The aroma is highly skunky - but I'll ignore that as a fresh bottle should be more neutral. But there's a touch of dimethyl sulfate as well (DMS; cooked corn) that can't be ignored. It's minor; but detracting. It does, however, express some grainy maltiness that's nice - and a touch of floral/herbal hoppiness shows up in the background. The body is medium with a fine carbonation that leaves it crisp in the mouth. The flavor is mainly of a grainy malt, although there are some light floral hops involved. A firm bitterness balances; and it finishes dry with a light residual malt and some nice hops.","NeroFiddled","Mar 15, 2003"
