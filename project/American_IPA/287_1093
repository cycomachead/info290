4.44,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was one of the beers that several years ago got me hooked on microbrews. Reviewing for first time on the occasion of my first time pouring it from a 16 oz. can. Then and now, I find it an almost perfect brew. It's hearty in its hop, consistent in body from initial mouthful to finish, great flavor in its mix of floral and pine, and very smooth. It's very worthy of its standard-setting rep. Delicious.","BuccoFan","Wednesday at 05:44 PM"

It's probably not going to win over the real hopoholics, but still a very nice smooth beer.  I feel like it may be closer to an APA vs. an IPA, but we're splitting hairs there.  The 7% is well-hidden, which can sneak up on you as these can go down quickly.","southsidejoe8089","Tuesday at 09:32 PM"

If anything it is a bit on the dry side, which I appreciate considering all the saccharine IPAs out there. Two-hearted as an abundance of fresh citrus and floral hop character with only a moderate bitterness. A great stalwart IPA.","maedhros09","Feb 21, 2015"

Aroma is floral hops, caramel malt, citrus hop, slight tropical fruit. Taste is hop forward with grapefruit peel, floral, and earthy pine bitterness. Some biscuit malt sweetness.

I was completely smitten and obsessed.  Since then a lot of hoppiness happiness has come into existence, but this is still a great beer, at least if you get it fairly fresh (...I've had bottles that are approx 3 month old, and they have been shadows of the real thing.)  Quite often, anymore, the melon notes really stand out to me and that is less than ideal, and definitely not the kind of bitterness I love.  Still, I find the flavor and mouthful profile to be fairly unique: I can pick it out, blind, when compared with almost any other IPA I've tasted.","Taybeh","Dec 29, 2014"

Nice and smooth, easy to drink, no sense of it being a 7 percenter. If it wasn't so pricey (relative to Otter Creek's Overgrown) this could easily be my go-to beer (which is currently Overgrown, hence the reference). In my opinion, the best thing about this excellent beer is that I can get in half a dozen places within 5 miles of my home. In a world where availability and price counted as much as everything else, this would rank higher then Heady Topper.","MarkGamber","Oct 18, 2014"

Big citrus and pine flavors, little fruity in the background, and a slight malt sweetness.  Medium body, crisp carbonation and a drying finish brings on some nice lingering bitterness.  This is a fantastic IPA.  Great value and one that I love to have around.  Side note, it reminds me of Lunch in a lot of ways.","HopBomb515","Sep 21, 2014"

Could not wait for it to be gone. Each sip popped an intolerably sweet flavor in my mouth. It created nice internal warmth, but burned like a watered down shot of bourbon going down. Some have said the alcohol taste is missing, but it was the most prevalent taste/feel I could recognize. I am no expert, so I am not sure how much to trust my rating.","Whim68","Aug 12, 2014"

Two Hearted recently was launched here in NYC and I have heard and read about this beer for so long my anticipation was very high. All I can say is this tasted like a slightly above average Pale Ale. Not very hoppy, VERY SWEET (not a fan of that). Maybe since this beer came out the playing field has evolved greatly?","crispinol","Aug 11, 2014"

OCCASION: Happy 38th birthday, myself--with the fam, Jer and Matt...APPEARANCE: orange amber body; filmy and hazy; thick, white three-finger head; lacing extends upward and thickly spreads across the glass--a great start... AROMA: fruity and hoppy; apple and citrus first; some bubblegum yeasts too; lastly, some metallic suggestions... PALATE: fantastic, medium-bodied and arresting--effervescent and alive; an IPA to sip and simmer with--little suggestion of alcohol, but definitely weightier than a pint glass... TASTE: balanced caramel malts underpin a hop festival of Noble and citrus--tangy tangerine and teeth-rattling pine resin, a combo that shakes and soothes in unison--this is the IPA the beer folk warn us about...OVERALL: as IPAs go, a mecca of sorts--the hype is to be believed--and although there are many that rival Two Hearted, it is a beer I will seek out again, even if it's only found in a case at a PSU distributor, as this was; the name itself evokes that "slow" short story that nonetheless reveals so much of man's plight and hope, and this is a worthwhile stab at perfection....","dacrza1","Aug 11, 2014"

Finish is actually a little sweet while still retaining hop taste. Fairly light bodied for the strength, but also a tad watery.","allengarvin","Jul 30, 2014"

Two hearts, because at first you hit with a strong hoppy flavor, and just when you think you know the exact aftertaste you're going to be hit with, it throws you a great aftertaste that you did not expect.

Balanced and approachable, in the sense that it is not as absurdly bitter or heavy as this style tends to want to be. Very well-made; there is no denying that Bell's has concocted an awesome beer here that is well worth a try.","thehyperduck","Jul 17, 2014"

It's not that this beer isn't delicious, because it is. It's one of the freshest, no-frills IPAs that I've ever tasted, but when you consider it's popularity and sheer difficulty to acquire (it's oft-times sold out before I make it to the bottle shop), it's just not THAT good. If I stumble upon this again, I'd, without hesitation, pick up a pack of it, but it doesn't hold the "WOW factor" that'll put me in a craze to seek out this over some more readily-available IPAs.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 17, 2014"

4.31,0.9,5,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,"T: Light tangerine and orange citrus, citrus florals, honeycomb, bready malts, salt water taffy. Slight piney tingly feeling reserved for final few seconds. Really almost no bitterness at all. The tart/sour phenomena is derived directly from the sweet fruits hop flavors, which perhaps compliment the soft graininess too well. This beer is maybe too 'fine', too 'well-adjusted', too 'balanced' for my liking that it comes across as blase. I'd like to call this an excellent blueprint for a foundation IPA.","orcrist_cleaver","Jul 16, 2014"

I am burping pine and actually enjoying the overhoppiness- its growing on me! Would go well with spicy food and gorgonzola cheese.","patre_tim","Jun 27, 2014"

Surprisingly, there was not as much hop aroma as I had expected from reading other reviews. Taste is nicely balanced bitterness with malty sweetness - probably could be described as "sessionable". Mouth feel is just right for the style. Overall a very fine IPA.","FFreak","Jun 24, 2014"

That being said, Bell's Two Hearted Ale is one I'll never not have in my beer fridge (not for a lack of trying to drink them all). For me, its the perfect IPA, highly floral with light fruity notes and a strong hoppy attitude. The bitter bite isn't beastly like you may see with so many other IPAs (particularly those of lower quality) but rather justly emboldened. This is, to me, the pinnacle of craft IPAs with the correct addition of fruity and floral flavors (and smells), right between a boring hoppy beer or some bastardized fruit cocktail.","REDsage","Jun 23, 2014"

Outstanding nose of citrus and dank hops - mostly tropical with grapefruit in the background. Light medium body which is modestly smooth in texture coupled with an above average carbonation level. The flavor profile is well balanced, but skewed towards citric bitterness, and complex. It begins with hop flavors, grapefruit over tropical, flows into a burst of dank hop flavor that yields itself to grapefruit rind bitterness and ends with a light biscuit sweetness. The finish has a bit of effervescence, is somewhat crisp yet also smooth. A moderate grapefruit rind bitterness lingers.","tillmac62","Jun 09, 2014"

Overall, I like the more tropical fruit flavored IPAs (using Citra, Nelson Sauvin, Galaxy, now even Simcoe, etc), but this is very good nonetheless. If any negative, perhaps this is too one dimensional, but I believe this is a single hop IPA.","JednoPivoProsim","May 22, 2014"

When I stopped in at Casey's Beer & Soda (Pine Bush NY) the staff informed me about this bargain ($8 for a four pack) and how I possibly was missing the best beer out there if you like hops. That is a big rep to live up to... but Bells pulls it off. The moment you pop the top of the can you smell the piney goodness-- a hint of lilac and some citrus. Pours a solid amber with very active carbonation. Excellent head and lacing retention. The nose is pine nuts and coriander. A quick bite of malty barley and the sting of pine mark the mid-palate transition. Lingering malt and spice. Finishes crisp, dry, and some lemon bite. A bit of skunk lager notes but the copper ale note persists in the aftertaste. Full bodied with good crisp mouthfeel. The alcohol is subdued. This is very sessionable from a taste standpoint. Very mellow IPA flavor. Tastes like a "baby war elephant" or session IPA but that 7% is there-- proceed with care and respect the beer. Really good. Excellent for that matter. Welcome to the Top Ten list Two Hearted Ale. 4.5 out of 5.","digitalflood","May 15, 2014"

This is a BIG beer, but the balance and structure make it a great beer just to have with a burger or pizza...anything really. I like to have my beer with a side of N2 O2...that's right just air. Anyway, this brew is great and definitely worth a purchase, but watch it...some stores charge up to $11+ for a six pack.

Could easily be sessionable, but it is rich enough to leave you feeling satisfied after just one. Great to share with your friends. I could see this beer being a nice segue beer for a friend exploring the craft brew scene. It may be a bit hoppy for them, but if you want to introduce someone to what an IPA should be, I view this one as a solid standard in any hop heads repertoire.","moysauce","Apr 21, 2014"

Aroma is soft citrus/floral notes, but also somehow briny and evocative to me of the seashore or (as more appropriate for Michigan) a day out on the lakes. The mouthfeel is rather full-bodied for an IPA. Carbonation is not noticeable. Very little bitterness/dryness--just a faint note from the hops. What is amazing here is the beautiful balance between the malts and hops, and the easy drinkability that somehow highly rewards every sip. And again, I find this beer highly evocative--really reminds me of laid-back days in the great, wild outdoors. One of my favorite IPAs.","AmyfaceNYC","Apr 17, 2014"

However, this one I purchased as a single 12 oz and it, obviously, had been sitting on the shelf a while. I believe this is a bottle conditioned beer as it had the hop residue and hazy appearance. I normally love this in a beer but this is an old IPA. No glory here. Overall it wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't living up to its potential and certainly drank/smelled more like a pale ale than an IPA. I was disappointed. If this is what it really tastes like than I would not willingly seek this out again. If I get a fresh one sometime I'll be sure to update my review to reflect my findings.","HopHog87","Apr 13, 2014"

Having just finished a souther tier Choklat(also $3), it took a few sips to clear that rich and flavorful beer out of my palette and when it did, boy was I excited. Hops, not as much as in Hopslam(my only other experience with Bell's)which was to be expected, hit the nose and the tongue in perfect balance. An incredibly drinkable and savorable IPA. I grabbed a six pack the next day and look forward to my next one. One other thing, the draft menu at the Arena had this listed as 5.3% ABV, it's actually 7%.","tmbgnicu","Apr 09, 2014"

However, the golden amber hue of this beer was quite impressive. Aroma of pine and light lemon zest. Hit me with a strong piney/grassy opening note. Very clean and refreshing with a pronounced bitter finish. The light carbonation lent to a bit of a watery mouthfeel, though pretty par for the IPA course. Overall, the only thing I felt that was lacking in this well-balanced, refreshing brew was a bit more of the citrus hop flavor. This would have bumped it up even higher that my great rating. Interested to try this on tap, extremely fresh one day. Excellent IPA.","Mikus","Apr 08, 2014"

Nose is orange juice, grapefruit, slight bitterness with some pine notes- mostly citrus. Little to no alcohol detected. Taste is citrus (on the mellow side, not extremely bitter) with some sugary malt backing and floral notes. Hops gradually coat the tongue, but not with as bitter a finish as other American IPAs. Medium carbonation, somewhat creamy texture. Medium-bodied with a nice balance. Overall this is a tasty IPA with understandably wide appeal.","xungmound98","Apr 07, 2014"

5,17.1,5,5,5,5,5,"This is my go to beer. One of my top 3 beers. Pours a radiant gold color that has a slight haze. Aroma I'd complex and enticing, a blend of sweetness, maltiness, fruitiness, and hoppiness, none of them overwhelming yet somehow each being strong and distinct. Taste does not disappoint, it is amazingly smooth throughout, making it hard to not down a whole glass quickly. Thick feel on the pallet. Hint of citrus tickles the tongue while the malt opens and promotes Itself. Good down smooth, leaving a mild hint of hops. Always makes you want more.","Gozillasnack","Mar 28, 2014"

4.64,8.7,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"poured into a wine glass. typical beige i.p.a head that doesnt stick around to much. pours a slightly hazy light amberish brown. this beer smells of citrus so strong. definatly an orange note but not as strong as hopslam. the taste however is grapefruit bitterness with a nice cereal or bread type backbone present after each sip. medium bodies mouthfeel typical to the style. overall you can see smell and taste where the idea for hopslam came from. great beer will definatly buy again!...cheers!","osant37","Feb 24, 2014"

It is really tough to come up with any negatives for this one, and tough to stop drinking it as well!

Unlike most IPA's that send you wave upon crashing wave of hop flavor and bitterness, this one drinks so easy that its 7% ABV will sneak up on you if you're not careful. A great choice both as an introductory IPA and an everyday brew.","DannyS","Jan 29, 2014"

4.55,6.6,4,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"It’s been too long since I’ve had a damn fine IPA. So, let’s have a damn fine IPA. Two Hearted Ale pours a hazy dull copper with half a finger or less of foamy white head that's quick to dissipate. Loads of citrus and pine hops on the nose. Herbal and earthy in the hop profile as well. Simple, clean and... whatever the smell equivalent is for "tasty." A very hop forward brew, no doubt, but the balancing power of its smooth malt backbone cannot be overstated. The finish has hints of citrus, lingering malt and then a swooping bitterness comes in to wipe the palate clear. Exquisite. Goes down way too smooth for its 7% ABV.","xabyss","Dec 31, 2013"

Slightly bitter and crisp finish. Light and tingly carbonation. Very balanced, drinkable brew. You can knock a few of these back with no problem.

Flavors of hoppy tropical fruit and citrus leading to earthy piney florals a quick sense of bready malt into a pronouncedly bitter finish that coats and lingers,very enjoyable and drinkable wish could get more than one.

3.69,-13.6,3.25,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"O- Overall, this is a solid offering in the IPA style. It's fairly priced and it's finally available in my area in upstate New York. Before two weeks ago, I have never seen this beer before. I know this beer has been rated more times than any other IPA on this site, but honestly I don't see why. The American IPA is the top dog on the craft beer scene. Every brewery makes an IPA. Some make several. There are many many IPA's to choose from out there. Thousands. What makes this beer stand out from the others? I think it tastes pretty above average, but like I said, it's one dimensional. There's not a lot of depth. It is good. I could place it in my top ten IPA's, but it definitely wont fall in my top five. To me this doesnt live up to the hype.","mitch3114","Oct 23, 2013"

When Bell's was still avoiding distribution in Illinois, we would drive to Indiana to hunt this down. Now it's in my grocery store, usually on sale (Dominick's needs to seriously rethink discounting this one). Fairly light in color, it's more of a yellow than an amber or an orange. Well carbed, you can stir it up to maintain a nice, foamy white head throughout your session. Lots of orange up front and hops in the back. It's hoppy enough for a hob head like me but won't offend.","EmpiricalBill","Sep 26, 2013"

While I would've perhaps preferred a bit more carbonation, I can't deny that this beer's reputation is well-deserved. An excellent brew, and one that I'd return to again and again if I could.","Ljudsignal","Sep 20, 2013"

Smells of fresh apricot and lemongrass. Taste begins with a big grapefruit rind flavor, followed by a light crackery malt middle. After that is some great citrus flavors, tangerine and grapefruit being the primary. The finish is super dry and piney. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall an outstanding IPA, super dry with massive citrus flavors make this one of my all time favorite IPAs.","tronester","Aug 20, 2013"

Smell is muted bready malts balanced very nicely with sweet floral and fruity notes, as well as some yeast scents. Taste is incredibly well balanced; it starts out with smooth subdued malt, buttery flavors and herbal/citrus/bitter hops all blend together in a delicious orgy of flavor. 7% isn't noticeable at all, I'd be tempted to session this one all day. Overall I'm a bit underwhelmed, but such is the case with probably almost any super-hyped beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Aug 01, 2013"

Intense citrus hops dominate in this one, unbelievably strong grapefruit flavor. Smells of citrus hops as well. On tap or in the bottle, it's really good. Cheers!","CoachC","Jul 17, 2013"

Taste is a nice tingly pine hop bite followed by some juicy grapefruit. Pretty noticeable malt presence. Very well balanced. Medium bodied with a tingly amount of carnonation. Oily mouthfeel. Not an in your face hop bomb but a good marriage of hops and malts. I think its been said before but this reminds me a bit of Racer 5. Overall, solid IPA for sure.","PicoPapa","Jun 12, 2013"

Perfect if you don't like overly bitter IPA's and would like a more citrusy example. It's from the Midwest but seems like it should be from the Pacific NW.

4.24,-0.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its blend through the flavoring. Every mouthful showcased a beautiful collaboration of solid sweetness of fruit, brightly citric and deeply spicy herbal hoppiness, and a clean, crisp malty backbone. You would get sugars here, sours there, earths way over there, and freshness everywhere. You were given consistency of quality, but with refreshing “newness” with each gulp. The nose was pleasantly fresh as well, and its best quality was its spicy hoppiness. The mouth was soft, helping ease the drinkability in spite of the more bittered and sour grassy hits of malts every now and again. This is a quintessential “third coast” IPA, giving bitterness from the west, even malty sweetness and freshness from the east, and offering a beer that would pair with just about any occasion.","TheBrewo","May 25, 2013"

4.02,-5.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a translucent gold color with roughly two fingers of foamy, pure-white head. Medeocre retention, but phenomenal lacing. The aroma is of spicy, earthen hops, pine, orange, and grapefruit. There's some wet earth and a bit of grass, as well as some subtle floral notes. Perhaps a hint of caramel malt to round things out. It tastes of lemon, grapefruit, and orange citrus up front, with spicy, almost gritty hops following suit. Some earth, grass, and even a touch of coriander appear, and a tiny amount of sweet caramel finishes it off. The mouthfeel is light (but not watery), vibrant, and bitter. It finishes clean and doesn't linger any longer than desired. Overall, this is a great, well-rounded IPA that is easy to drink and full of flavor. It does a great job of showcasing aromatic, flavoring, and bittering hops all in one, and is one I'm happy to frequent.","eclipse54","May 20, 2013"

I really don't need to finish with a huge closing statement about this beer. As someone who's just started homebrewing and a huge fan of hops when they're pervasive in a beer but not grating, and also with beers that strive to find so much balance and use such fresh ingredients - which many brewers fail to do with IPAs - this really is one of the hop masterpieces of this country. I hate to add so much to the hype, but find fresh batches of this and drink it on tap whenever you have the chance. If always this consistent, this is probably the best IPA brewed year-round in the country. And with that, I leave myself in mountains of hops and joy. My favorite beer I had on my trip to Chicago.

I'm not generally a fan of the IPA style, with it's overt hoppiness, but this one was done in an exceedingly balanced way, that made it a joy to drink.","noahallington","Apr 25, 2013"

Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, slight pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes; with well balanced malt. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Moderate floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and light honey on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of hop flavors; with a great malt balance that still showcases the hops; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent IPA! Great balance and good complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2013"

4.95,15.9,4.5,5,5,4.75,5,"A cool little story: A few years ago a few buddies of mine were backpacking Isle Royale (Island in Lake Superior, Northern Michigan) and we met 2 guys from Germany who came to canoe the island. The only store on the island, which included a mini restaraunt, just happened to stock only bells beer, and a huge selection of it. We met them in a campground near the lodge and they had just bought a case of Oberon and 2 six packs of Two-Hearted. Their english wasn't very good, but they basically said that American beer is shit compared to Germany (and grudgingly Belgium), except that Two-Hearted and Oberon (probably due to Germans fondness for wheat beer) are both some of there favorite beers, ever. I thought that was pretty cool, Germans having mad respect for some local MIchigan Craft Brew.","Roman5150","Mar 31, 2013"

English styles give you a dose of malt and settle for less than what a hop head really needs. It seems to me some of these real good Midwestern/Great Lakes area breweries knock it out of the park when talking a sit down and drink, everyday IPA. This one is a prime example of what this specific region does better than anyone and it's a hallmark creation of what Bell's does best. Anyone looking for that go to IpA when say the next BIG seasonal hasnt quite hit the shelves then this is the one. Plus there is a freaking fish about to be slayed by some Midwesternman after a hard days work. No he's not shown, but you can imagine. This is one fish everyone needs to catch. It's good stuff.","BradtheGreat7","Mar 26, 2013"

4.09,-4.2,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"The beer pours a golden orange, with a finger width head made of small tightly packed bubbles. The beer leaves a lacing of tightly packed bubbles that form a sticky curtain on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body is a cloudy haze, and a steady stream of bubbles can be seen racing up the glass. On the nose, the beer smells pungently citrusy with nice spicy notes of pine. The malt base of the beer is light and bready with a touch of spice, but nearly nonexistent on the nose. Orange peel citrus is the big player in the nose, and is nicely inviting. On the tongue the beer tastes bitter with a touch of sweet acidity. In flavor, the beer tastes of bitter medicinal hops with touches of citrus orange peel. The finish is strong with caramel bready malts with touches of spice. The aftertaste lingers with bitter hops and light orange citrus. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a light velvety carbonation. The mouth is left clean with a bitter dryness lingering on the tongue. Overall this is a solid IPA with some nice orange citrus hops. It is not the best I’ve had, but it is solid and tasty. If it’s in your area, you should try this beer.","Maxwell","Mar 25, 2013"

This is a beer that is good all year long. If its hot, cold, or somewhere in between I could always go for one of these. It is medium in bodied but still light enough to have a couple or more.

To me, it seems a bit more similar to east coast IPAs like Dogfish Head's 60 and 90 minute varieties, and is a nice change from the over-the-top hop-bombs that are so common with this style. Smooth mouthfeel and subtle flavors make this an excellent IPA.","Dave_in_GR","Feb 28, 2013"

Aroma is dominant hops, like when I open a package to add to my homebrews. Taste is a nice blend and balance of hops & citrus without either being over dominant. Smooth & silky mouthfeel makes it so easy to drink. Excellent beer!","gotweid","Feb 05, 2013"

This is what an American IPA should be, given the stylistic description and my personal opinion. I should keep a case of this around just to keep my taste buds used to it. Great for those days when work sucked and you need a beer to punch you in the face, yet keeps you coming back for more.","scot_chale","Feb 04, 2013"

The aroma is sugar cookie with a lot of grapefruit and some orange as well. There are also some light floral notes. The initial taste is sweet with some sugar cookie and a bunch of grapefruit and a bit of orange as well as a bit of caramel. The finish has a mild bitterness as well as quite a bit of sweetness. Medium-light bodied. Relatively low carbonation. A bit more sweetness than I would like, but a pretty solid IPA, especially for one that is regularly available.","jethrodium","Jan 02, 2013"

Clean good flavors with intense drinkability. Nice big malty back bone that holds the beer and all it's flavors together into one great sip that leaves you looking for more. Had this out in chicago over the weekend and it was my first time out there, this along with some others i've had while i was out there made it clear that between english ipa's and west coast ipa's there is a legitimate midwest style ipa that is simple and delicious in it's own way. Super drinkable with simple but well blended flavors. Good reputation for a reason.","jtierney89","Nov 26, 2012"

Fairly bitter citrus-tinged hops are ever-present as is the biscuity malt bill. Finishes dry with citrus rind bitterness. Medium-bodied, well-carbonated, and smooth. Very drinkable, however the nose tends to promise much more depth to the flavor than is actually delivered. Certainly a very solid American IPA, but nothing groundbreaking.

Smells a very out doors like evergreens and citrus, grapefruit, resinous, fir and balsam notes, just appropriate for said-named beer. Bitter hits early, and modulates and sustains for some time. Grapefruit rind bitter and balanced malt sweet, with strong afterglow and terrific echo, staying with the palate. This one, a terrific sipper, goes camping with me.

I was expecting a bit more from Bell’s on this especially with such great reviews and it leaves me wondering if I'm missing something here.

4.85,13.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is, quite simply, one of the best American IPAs on the market. It's made by Bell's Brewery in Michigan. It's popular in Michigan, Ohio, and other midwestern states. It's a tad pricey ($10.99 is a good deal for a six-pack) but it's definitely worth it. It packs a punch at 7%, but the high ABV isn't overwhelming in the taste. One of my favorite beers. You can't get it in Texas as of right now. Come on, Bell's! Send some Two-Hearted our way! Some Oberon, too!","vandywisky","May 26, 2012"

It pours an almost perfect orange like the flesh of a fresh orange with a little murkiness to give it a good mysteriousness. The head is off-white, big, and persistent, leaving huge cobwebs of oily lacing all over the glass. The nose is a burst of caramel sweet malt and crushed mango, lemons, and a little bit of a green pine cone as well. The taste follows perfectly, full of sweet fruity mangoes that makes you almost feel like you should have the juice running down your chin. The bittering is big, but not crushing and hangs around a long time as you drink this beer. Great feel with excellent carbonation. This is a great beer, just how an IPA should taste and the availability makes it a great go-to beer.","estlinska","May 22, 2012"

Smell is mango, pineapple, tangerine, grass, and grapefruit. Taste is all of that extremely well balanced, leaving you with subtle grapefruit finish. Body is light, plenty of carbonation, on the dry side, and very drinkable. I need to thank my friend Pat for hauling from Florida for. A true treat!

Smell was mild yet it had a medicinal overtone to it that was also present in the taste and finish. It's light and smooth on the palate. Almost reminded me of Hamm's Golden Draft without the macro carbonation. The medicinal aftertaste doesn't linger long in the finish and is replaced by a pleasant, malty flavor. Overall, it's a pleasant beer. But I was hoping for more from the reviews I've read. I may purchase it again.","grogged","May 14, 2012"
4.47,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a bright golden orange with a thumbs width white head. Limkted lacing. A nice, bright, citrus, floral and breaddy aroma. Flavor is great and so balanced.Juicy orange, floral, and perhaps my favorite bready malt underbelly for an IPA. A creamy, crisp mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Overall, fantastic beer and right there alongside with Odell's when it comes to IPA's for me. Got to admit, give me the option of this or Odell's and I don't know which one I'd choose, very possibly this one. Fantastic beer....want more!","denver10","May 14, 2012"

4.38,2.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall (4.5): This is just so well-balanced, without relying on sweetness to balance out the hops. As a result, it drinks like a session beer in spite of the 7.0% ABV, and is easy-going. A real knock-out in this style might be hoppier, might be more pungent, might be lacier, etc., but this is just so tasteful and balanced. Excellent beer, it’s like an exercise in what your standard IPA should be, nailing every aspect without screaming for attention at any point.","fmccormi","Apr 16, 2012"

4.45,4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I really like this beer and it's one of may favorite American IPA's, they don't get much more solid then this and the mixture of citrus and floral hops is just about perfect and gives this a beer a distinct aroma and taste that is unique to this beer. This beer has great drinkability, when I was younger I was known to drink a six pack in a session but after one too many rough mornings I have come to the conclusion that two or three of these is the perfect amount. What I liked most about this beer were the flavor and aroma, they are kick ass they set this beer apart from all the other IPA's on the market. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I thought long and hard and I can't really think of a single thing wrong with this beer, I would like to see it in cans, but the fact it comes in a mini keg is pretty kick ass. I will continue to regularly buy this beer and since I live in Michigan this beer is almost always an option at any descent bar or restaurant, and it pairs well with almost any type of food, I like it the most with some hot wings. If you consider yourself an IPA aficionado and have not tried this beer, you need to seek it out ASAP, enough said. I love this beer and I think I always will, to me this is the quintessential Michigan IPA, pretty much a classic. Bell's is one of the most consistent brewerys and this beer is very solid, like most of their lineup, one of the best American IPA's from one of the best American brewerys.","StoutHunter","Mar 27, 2012"

Taste is amazing. Flawless really. Hints of sweet citrus flavors such as grapefruit and candied orange. The hops don't slap your tongue silly (I usually like that) but who cares when this beer tastes so good. Really refreshing and an easy drinker even at 7%. This beer also left some gorgeous lacing. This is my first from Bell's and I know I'm going to try more from them, not to mention purchase this beer again. Like a lot of reviewers before me have stated, the Bros really missed the mark on this excellent IPA.","KLAYNE87","Feb 21, 2012"

Pours a beautifully clear golden color, plenty of bubbles, with a creamy white one finger head on the top. The aroma consists of sweet pale malts, grapefruit, honey, just a hint of pine. Flavor follows as smooth as can be. Some up front bitter slowly drifts into a sweet honey grapefruit flavor and finishes with a clean crisp bite. Lively carbonation, light on the palate, and goes down way too easy. Not a world beating hop bomb IPA, but one of the most drinkable beers on earth.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

There's a touch of sweet malt in the taste, but it's more than overpowered by the sharp citric hop flavor. From beginning to end this one is just full of that classic American hop taste. Moderate carbonation and a slightly less than medium body give a very smooth mouthfeel that ends with a moderate bitterness and a nice dryness on the palate. The beer just screams classic American IPA, and does so very well.","charliedvrs","Feb 07, 2012"

Having said that, its a good beer, more along the lines of a pale ale then an IPA in my opinion. A good choice for any entry level IPA drinkers or somebody wanting a hoppy taste that wont bog them down.","TwelveOunces","Feb 03, 2012"

Pours into my tulip glass with a huge, fluffy head. Smells nicely of citrus hops. Great taste: tangy, slightly bitter, very citrusy. Creamy feal for a single IPA. Overall an excellent beer,and not nearly as expensive or hard to get as its big brother, Hopslam.","DrStiffington","Feb 03, 2012"

Tropical hop aromas. Mango. Hints of sweet melons. Flavor is hop forward but not so much as to be tipping the scales one way or the other. A decent balance for the style overall. Medium-bodied. Sweet malt accentuates citrus-centric hops. Cascade and Centennials play their hand for sure. Caramel and toffee flavors as well as a bit of nuttiness blend in well. Great all-around beer that reminds one of a lawn-mower style beer. Low IBUs and decently hidden alcohol could make this dangerous.","seedsofchaos","Jan 27, 2012"

Looks great, the color of golden-honey with nice clarity and a wonderful head of foam topping it. My mother’s aroma description still holds—floral, citrus pine with some grapefruit zest and spicy hops rounding it out. Tastes piney and bold with some resin. A bit of chew gives it heft, and there’s a pleasant hop bitterness but a sweetness from the excellent malt bill balances it out. Fantastic finish. And, incidentally, wonderful art on the bottle.

I'm also detecting peach and mango. It leaves a faint hop bitterness on the tongue. The mouthfeel is just exceptional on this one. It is very mild and smooth, and has a sparkling effervescence to it.

When it comes down to it, however, this is neither my favorite IPA or a bad one, at that.

There doesn't seem to be a complex mixture of hops, but it has a good amount of hops (though not that hoppy). It has a really citrusy flavor from the hops and is very easy to drink. I could easily drink these all night, and it has a pretty good ABV for how smooth it is. I definitely recommend this beer if you can get your hands on it, but it is not worth stressing about trying if you are a huge hop head that appreciates big hop flavor. It is a pretty good IPA, but still not the best that I have tried in my short time as a beer nerd.","BeerNoobNC","Nov 27, 2011"

Awesomely balanced and big flavor profile. This one would be a hop bomb if not for the perfect amount of sweet malt and vice versa. Silky smooth grapefruit starts off the hop profile and leads into the tasty caramel and sweet bread malt. Perfect amount of sweetness for an IPA, sweet without being too noticeably sweet. Strong pine flavors give a quick, crisp hop finish to the beer. Very simple flavors, but they go great together and the mouthfeel is perfect as well.","uustal","Nov 23, 2011"

The taste was of rich malt with a heady mix of peach and floral hops. The feel was medium and wet. Having read all the devotionals to this beer on here over the years I was eager to have one. Finding myself at a bar in Dublin OH that had this, I was ready to give it a try. The aroma and taste were really much more than I had expected. A beautiful use of hops to enhance and not merely bitter the beer. Quite an enjoyable beer.","claytri","Nov 04, 2011"
4.07,-4.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, a good IPA but very sweet. I love balance in an IPA but this is just a bit too sweet. It's a combination of the very fruity hops and the inherent sweetness of the beer. The aroma is incredible, I just wish it were a little less sweet.","adman08","Nov 03, 2011"
4.25,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall- In the end, this IPA sacrifices being aggressively hoppy to get the malt to smooth out the mouth feel and make this beer a really easy drinker. This is a fantastic IPA and one that should be readily available in any hop-head's fridge.","Pintofbrown","Oct 31, 2011"
3.71,-13.1,3.5,5,3,3.5,3.75,"Appearance is light copper with two healthy fingers of head. There is some retention of the head throughout and it leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite pleasant - fresh citrus and hops are very noticeable. The flavor is lemony with a hop presence, but the body is too subtle for an IPA. This beer is enjoyable because it is complex, but it lacks the body I like in an IPA. It is certainly worth a try, but its reputation is quite inflated if you ask me.","57md","Oct 31, 2011"
4.76,11.5,5,4,5,5,5,"I cannot express my respect for the taste of this beer. A perfect example of an American IPA. Piney, malty, creamy and smooth. Some citrus, but not alot. This baby is perfect for a summer bbq or sitting in front of the tv watching football. Full bodied and just wonderful. As the beer warms in the glass the malts start to come through more and it just stays creamy... Delicious.","osusullins","Oct 30, 2011"

3.41,-20.1,4.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Has a nice orange color to it which is what I would expect. The hops are present in the bittering department but they seem to be lacking in the aroma. I'm tasting a little sweetness that doesn't really seem to belong there. Overall, I'd say it's a decent beer but not something that I would seek out. If it were offered to me or available for $1 a bottle, I'd drink it again.","bwmichaud","Oct 20, 2011"
4.35,1.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O- Probably my favorite IPA. It is very easy to get caried away with this beer. I also prefer it on draft, which I have had multiple times.","Gtg642","Oct 19, 2011"
4.6,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The fruitiness and sweetness are incredibly prominent, and I really have a hard time believing this is an IPA-- but that IPA bitterness is very much there at the end, and provides an interesting and welcome contrast to the first flavors. The flavor system present in this beer is incredibly complex, and while it can easily be downed in a few gulps, it really must be savored to be truly appreciated.","hombrepalo","Oct 18, 2011"
4.47,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Two-Hearted Ale is of a slightly hazy amber hue with a nice foamy head. The aroma suggests multiple hop varieties with citrus notes dominating. More so than many other IPAs I've tried, this one has a very clear and distinct grapefruit and pineapple dominance. The flavor was very big with Tart fruits and flower petal, along some malt present with the hop bitterness. I want to emphasize that the bitterness is really turned up on this one, especially in the finish. The mouth feel is 'sticky.' This is a somewhat complex ale... if the complexity was turned up one more notch with a hint of something else I may have given this beer a perfect score.","Neorebel","Oct 17, 2011"
3.47,-18.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"pleasant citrus grapefruit aroma. Appearance is golden with a nice head. Taste is citrus grassy hops with a pleasant copper taste.

3.21,-24.8,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a nice orangish yellow with a decent off whit head. The smell is less than what I was expecting with an ok hop presence immediately followed by a strong malt presence. The beer tastes very much like it smells. The mouthfeel is light to medium light with good carbonation. Overall q balanced beer just not the ipa I was expecting.","rowingbrewer","Oct 17, 2011"
4,-6.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Two Hearted pours an orange/amber color. Two fingers of white foam recede leaving minimal lacing and a thin coaster which lingers atop the beer. The nose is citrus and floral hops. Taste is orange rind and pale malt. Mild bitterness and and bread give way to a sweet citrusy finish. The beer is medium bodied with creamy texture. A nice take on the style by Bells.","Sideswipe","Oct 15, 2011"
4.15,-2.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall - I'll give some bonus points here for drinkability, as it hides the alcohol very well. It's a solid IPA for sure. It's not as bitter as some, which is a bit of a change of pace. There's still a lot of flavor going on, and (IMO) the malt is balanced. My West Coast friends would disagree.","HotHands","Oct 15, 2011"

4.35,1.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I love this beer. There is so much subtlety and I think that's where it shines. It doesnt have the huge nose or flavors of a sculpin or a west coast ipa but it doesn't have to. A great everyday go-to beer, can't wait till they ramp up production so its easier to find.","bballmj2k","Oct 13, 2011"

4.32,1.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: For some reason, I didn't really care for Bell's Two Hearted Ale the first couple of times I tried it. My palate must have changed because I really enjoy it now. In fact, it's very comparable to Founders Centennial IPA (though Two Hearted would have to get the edge).

5,17.1,5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a clear deep gold that leaves a two finger head. The aroma is candied oranges and pineapple. Smells floral, sweet, bitter, and delicious. The taste is perfect. Starts of slightly bitter but a nice caramel sweetness comes in to balance it out. Not too sweet, yet not too bitter. Perfect balance. I get mostly citrus wrapped in caramel candy. Drinkability is extremely high. This is the best single IPA I have ever had, granted I live in Florida and do not have access to most California and other west coast IPAs. The perfect beer in every way. Great for noobs, great for hop heads, and great for those who are looking to get into IPAs. A+","hmf05","Oct 06, 2011"

Medium bodied with a bit of a sticky finish. Honestly I don't know if this one could have ever lived up to the hype for me; however, it came pretty close and that still says a lot.

Smell is of fresh floral and piney hops and citrus aromas. Taste is of very nice floral/herbal hops, citrus juice/zest, and a malt flavor on the finish. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA that is very easy to drink.

Somehow these coexist together without really integrating; it's an interesting effect. Taste is more pine and flower forward, with the citrus almost absent, both of which mingle with some biscuity malt. Mild bitter finish.

4.42,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice murky orange-amber pour, with a foamy head that leaves pillow lace. Beautiful mixture of citrus and floral notes in the nose. Well done... wonderfully hopped from beginning to end, without overtaking any of the other portions of the brew. Nice orange peel and grapefruit essence in the citrus dept. Very quaffable, as the citrus and malt combine for a perfectly round and smooth mouthfeel. Pine resin lingers in the finish, peppering the back of the mouth with a decent IBU. Again, the drinkability is very much the biggest "pro" of this brew. IPA’s are my fave (as are doubles and impy’s), and this one doesn’t disappoint. ABV doesn’t particularly show... possibly in the peppery aftereffects of the finish, there shines a note or two of alcohol, but well-integrated.","ChrisSimpson1968","Aug 21, 2011"

Lives up to the hype--but a touch less drying bitterness would make it just about a 9 on a 10-point scale (or 4.5 of 5) for me; it just sucks the moisture from the inside of my mouth about as completely as "Mr. Thirsty" does at the dentist's office.","AdvocateFan","Jul 22, 2011"

But in my opinion, its strength lies in its ability to maintain a "low profile" while boasting a 7% ABV and drinking incredibly smoothly with plenty of hop refreshness without being overly bitter or thick bodied. This would make a great (but dangerous) summer day kick-back-and-enjoy-the-day pale ale. A very solid "A" brew here.","DrewV","Jul 14, 2011"

The taste follows the aroma and doesn't really step forward in any specific aspect. It starts off with the bitterness from the hops and it pretty much never leaves. There is some light grapefruit which lingers around and just a touch more would be great. I like the way this one finishes with just a bit of mild bitter/dryness but still nice and crisp. Very drinkable but to me this just doesn't bring home the style.

After the pour the beer had a 3/4 inch cream head and as I drink it leaves sticky lacing. The smell of this beer is absolutely spectacular, I caught whiffs of orange before I was able to get the cap all the way off my bottle. The dominant smell is the citrus hops, but I think I am catching some floral hops as well. The taste starts with a slight sweetness, in the middle of my tongue I get a bit of pine flavor, finally as I swallow the beer I get a strong grapefruit bitterness. This grapefruit lingers into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel for this beer is just where it should be.

It still tasted like Bell's Two-Hearted, but the aggressive hop character was replaced by a mellow complexity and more well-rounded flavor. The sharp citrus-like notes were gone. In their place were more subtle, herbal, tea-like notes that complemented a faint, fruity flavor in the background.

One of my 3-4 goto beers until the price increase and it still find itself in my fridge more often than it probably should with Columbus IPA around. Fresh on tap. Pours a golden orange body with a beautiful cream colored head. Smell is evertything you could hope for in an IPA. Just punches you in the face with piney/citursy hops. Taste is much the same, a little bit of fruit, a little bit of citrus and a lot of pine, leaving a wonderful bitterness on the palate.","Puddintane","May 06, 2011"

The aroma is not particularly grand, but is pleasant nonetheless. Scents include malt, floral notes, light pine. The flavor is tasty, and though the beer is primarily hop forward, it definitely has a strong malt backbone. This is a good example of what I would consider a "balanced" IPA. Though I prefer beers of this ilk to be lighter on the palate and more hop forward with a pronounced citrus component, there is no denying that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a tasty brew. Additionally, I think this beer, like many IPAs, is a notch better on draft versus the bottle.","Huhzubendah","May 05, 2011"

The only criticism I can come up with is that there's the slightest touch of either metallic or phenolic taste, barely enough to notice. While sometimes this can be a welcome addition to the mix of flavors, in this case I didn't feel that it added anything. Still, this was a very minor issue for me, and for a standard IPA this is one of the best I've had. I imagine this beer is even better fresh, I don't know how old it is, but I know that it's at least from January. All things considered, it has held up rather well.","stageseven","May 03, 2011"

Easily the best Bell’s I’ve had to date, and probably one of the best IPAs in the field. Lots of flavor and aroma, and a great look and feel to support it.

Mild cereal malt fills out the rest of the aroma, filling in the cracks left by the hops. Moderate carbonation, good mouthfeel, nice hop bitterness in the finish. Taste is hop forward, but there's a nice subtle malt sweetness that helps balance things out. The body of the beer is lightly syrupy, though the heavy carbonation helps keep it from being overpowering or cloying.

3.14,-26.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Poured this american IPA out of a 12 oz bottle and into a pint glass. The AIPA poured a hazy golden color and produced a nice thick 2 finger width head. Head retention on this beer is excellent and the lacing is one of the best I have seen. The aroma is nice and hoppy, a little above average for an AIPA. There were some notes of citrus. The taste of the beer is a little watery- Its a little weak with the amount of malt. Light body, it makes it a very drinkable IPA but I dont really look for that in an IPA. After the thinness subsides, there is a pronounced hop bite, but it does not linger. The finish has hints of citrus and it is slightly dry. Overall there is nothing special about this beer- does not come close to my top ten list of IPAs. But hey..its not like Bells makes a Kolsh right?","GossageBrewery","Apr 07, 2011"
4.41,3.3,5,4,5,3.5,4,"O: A very good IPA. Very enjoyable to have with several types of heavier and creamier flavors such as steaks and rich alfredo sauces and such.

Not much malt coming through all that hop smell. Tastewise... probably the best balance I've seen in an IPA so far. Floral hop is the star feature, but the pine comes through as well & not shampooey at all as I feared it might be. It's bold, sweet and finishes w/ a pleasant dryness. Mouthfeel is almost creamy with a nice thickness to it. I'd highly recommend it to IPA lovers.","Justin23060","Apr 02, 2011"

First taste hit the hops first, but not overpowering, felt balanced a noticed a bit on the sweetness / honey at the end, and made me really want more. Very smooth and easy to drink several in one sitting. Its not as flashy as some of the other hyped IPA's, its just an all around great beer.","Dan3279","Apr 02, 2011"

Although Blind Pig was really good, it was only hops and some sweetness that would make the overall beer taste more "juicy" (IOW, giving the sugar to the hops to make the beer taste more like exotic fruits).

To be widely accepted, I think you have to have a fairly non-offensive taste. This leaves out any wacky nuance that you might find in other beers. I think this is a crowd pleasing staple. I liked the golden orange pour and two fingers of head. The flavor was hops and citrus, but not overpowering. This could almost be described as an aggressive pale ale. All of the quality that you expect is in this beer, and I will be coming back to this one.","beerdown77","Mar 20, 2011"
4.17,-2.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This pours a slightly hazy copper with a nice, two finger white head that leaves good frothy lace around. On the nose there is a huge mixture of oranges, grapefruit, fresh cut grass, and a hint of a caramel backbone. This nose is unrealIn the mouth there are grapefruits and oranges hanging out over a malt background that never gets in the way. It's balanced very much towards the citrus bomb part of the IPA spectrum, but it's still balanced. Later some spice and bitterness that hangs with a fuzzy finish. It's a medium body, thin enough to not stick at the sides of the palate, but the huge hop presence means it's a long finish. This is a truly great IPA, a desert island type beer, and it's available all year round in a large chunk of the country.","EricCioe","Mar 20, 2011"

I think this is a tweener IPA - in between the big west coast hop bombs and balanced east cost IPAs.","nickshep7","Mar 17, 2011"

It is highly drinkable- if I missed anything in this beer, I wanted more biting hops more than the tropical fruit flavors present here.

Nevertheless, it is more drinkable than your standard India Pale Ale due to its more pleasant (less acerbic) finish than you will find in some.","RossCain","Jan 31, 2011"

I'm fairly certain this hop character is on it's way down from ones I've had in the past, but the hops are still quite there. The mouthfeel on this is rather smooth for an IPA and there is hardly any bitterness to be found.

Smell...oooo, fruit city, this is not your ordinary IPA...cherry, pear, pineapple, malt, and more malt. Taste leaves my mouth wanting more. Flavors of roasted wheat, peach, cherry, pineapple, pine, lemon, sweet malt barley, and piney hops. Mouthfeel was like drinking heavy cream.

Overall very light, especially for having so much flavor. Everything seems very balance. Very drinkable. Smooth mouthfeel, nothing overpowering or too potent on the finish.","despainmakesbeer","Dec 06, 2010"

It may have its equals, but there are none better among the ones I've tried. It starts out smooth, then a hoppy bitterness appears, and finally a slightly sour taste emerges, emphasis on "slight."

Medium bodied mouthfeel, I feel like this beer hits all the right notes. High drinkability and really it's a shame I wont be able to make this brew a habit since distribution in NY isnt happening.

4.07,-4.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Two Hearted Ale pours a nice dark tangerine/orange color; not 100% translucent as it has a little bit of haze to it. A nice three finger head of creamy bone colored foam rises up. Retention is very good, but lacing is a bit spotty for an American IPA. Nose is pretty good, a citrus and pine bomb, but I'm not finding any hint of malt balance. The malt definitely shows up in the taste though, equal parts caramel and bready and very good. A wave of bitterness (just a bit much for a beer of this size) washes over my palate next. I really like that this isn't just straight up citrus on the back end, a healthy dose of pine works really well. Body is a little bit light for this beer, but I think carbonation is especially key for a beer like this as it can help elevate (or dull) the hops and Bell's really nailed it for Two Hearted. It's carbed a little bit on the high end, but not anywhere close to becoming obnoxious. The only real chink in Two Hearted's armor is a level of bitterness that I think is *just* overstepping its bounds. It really is a minor quibble in the face of a great beer.","axeman9182","Oct 20, 2010"

That and the 7.1% ABV bring the drinkability down a couple of notches, but it shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone looking to try an IPA at the top of its game.

The taste was a nice balance with the complex hop profile just in front of a firm sweet caramel malt backbone. The beer is on the light side of medium and is quite smooth and refreshing.

The taste is very similar, though the balance is much better. Both camps respect each other for their ferocity and professionalism. Damn, does it make for one tasty battle.

Aromas of pure citrus, limes, orange peel, some cloves with a taste to match. Nice hoppy balance, but not overwhelming like other IPA's I have tasted in the past. Perfect balance between citrusy hops and malts, medium bodied beer with a lighter mouthfeel and extremely easy drinkability.

The initial 1.5 inches of foam decreased somewhat but didn't disappear entirely. The carbonation was very nice. I could see lots of tiny bubbles. The aroma was one of the great features of this beer. It had a strong hops aroma with citrus notes. With respect to taste, the bitterness of the hops hit me right away and stayed until the finish. It's nicely balanced, however, with a little bit of sweetness. It was definitely not overly hoppy for my taste. Bell's Two Hearted Ale was a pleasure to drink.","sonata2008","Jul 28, 2010"

Pours a clear, bright burnt orange with a thick frothy white head that takes a long time to recede, but never truly disappears. The nose is beautiful blend of citrus/pine/resin hops and some caramel malt. On the palate this beer is extremely balanced showcasing the grapefruit hops and bread malts perfectly. The alcohol is also very well integrated. The body is medium with average carbonation and a nice long finish that is both citrus and bitter.

The nose is too, redolent, bright and yet suffuse with beautiful citrus and floral hops. Truly a centennial showcase, the palate replicates the flavor. Opening with a bright citrus and floral hop character, this is really smooth. A touch sweeter than it is on tap, there's a little cotton candy sweetness.

Anyway the flavor is still on my tongue 10 minutes between sips so it strong long lasting pine resin compelling almost gin like. the mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and slick bodied IPA.

Why can't every brewery do something like this? It REALLY matters! Beer pours a golden amber with a large head which settles to a coating only at the last couple of sips. Lacing is thin but lasting. A whiff of this beer is a pretty perfect IPA-lover's dream - citrus (esp. grapefruit orange), pine and flowery. Not the strongest nose but pleasant. Taste is grapefruit, lemon, pine resin but pretty nicely balanced with tastes of orange and sweet malts. The finish moves toward bitter but without assault - just notes that put a nice end on a good performance. Bravo. Mouthfeel is creamy, a little slick and medium-bodied.

Initially, I get that amazing fruit snack taste. Not the typical citrus tastes you get from an IPA...I'm getting the citrus along with berry flavor. I'm picking up boysenberries and raspberries too. Very interesting and delicious. I can't get over this flavor. A little melon lingers in the aftertaste. The hop flavorings and bitterness are not much different than HopSlam (HopSlam is just this on Steroids with honey). This mouthfeel is nothing less than perfect.

The tons of citrus and pine are the stars here, but it's perfectly balanced with nice sweet maltiness.

It smells like hops and malts, very sweet, but a definite hoppy odor. It tastes hoppy but very sweet as well, just a touch bitter. I think this would be the perfect thirst quencher after doing something like mowing the lawn on a hot day. Can drink this all day.","RodneyX","May 13, 2010"

3.3,-22.7,4,4,3,3,3,"Not at all what I was expecting. I was hoping the citrus and/or floral character from hops traditionally tossed in an American IPA would show in this brew. The bittering character was, in my opinion, too dry and lacked a friendlier complement.

3.75,-12.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"This is a good IPA. I guess the best way to descibe this one is balance. The hops don't overpower and blend smoothly with the malts. It has a nice simple citrus/hoppy aroma, but nothing earth shattering. This is definately the IPA to session with if you are careful of the ABV. The balance makes this one very easy to drink and doesn't kill your tastebuds after a couple. While not the greatest overall IPA, it is a very nice example of the style.","Liverpool08","Apr 25, 2010"

The smell of this bear makes me eager to drink it. It's a combination of peach, apricot, and orange. The taste is a pretty well balanced. There is just enough malt sweetness to carry the hops that are pronounced but not too too bitter. This is a nice light (in color and mouthfeel) beer that will be great going into Spring. This is a very drinkable beverage that is suitable to both beginners to the style and expert connoisseurs.","andrewinski1","Apr 07, 2010"

I put this up there with Torpedo from SN and Sweetwater's IPA as some of my favorite IPA's readily available in my area. I've had both of them less than ten days old and can't wait to try a fresher batch of Two Hearted.

Two Hearted is one of the best smelling beers in all the land. The first swig of this brew and you will be about knocked over by the hop punch. Citrus and piney hop notes continue to evolve and make this one of the best IPA's available. Two Hearted has a level mouthfeel that easily hides the 7% ABV.

4.1,-4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Poured from my home tap, this one has a golden orange color with a billowy, off-white head. The color is deceptively light compared to the flavors packed inside. Very fragrant, with the aroma having a complex hop character that is both citrusy and earthy. The flavor amplifies these characteristics, with notes of grapefruit, pine, and grass. This is not just another hop-bomb, though, as there is also at least a bit of balance from an underlying caramel malt sweetness (but the malt aspect is certainly subtle compared to the hops). The mouthfeel is both crisp and resinous somehow, with a refreshing, hoppy bite that morphs into a sticky, lingering bitterness. Overall, it's wonderfully bitter, yet quite drinkable, especially considering the 7% alcohol. I've had Dogfish 60-minute and Foothills Hoppyum on my tap before this one, and Two-Hearted is as good if not better in some aspects. It is certainly a go-to beer for the style.","devilben02","Jan 31, 2010"

Scents of floral hops, citrus rinds and sweet candy. This smells really inviting. The body is smooth and slightly oily on the tongue. Crisp carbonation backs it up well. Nice sharp bitter hops right away, but nothing that is too harsh or scalding. Finishes sweet like honey biscuits. Wow. I've had this in bottle form, but much prefer it on tap.

The flavour drags you in with a ridiculously large grapefruit and citrus flavour congruous to the bittering subtleties of the hops.

Smells of very sweet citrusy hops. Two Hearted's scent and flavor match perfectly as sweet citrus hops dominate the flavor with a touch of grass in the aftertaste. Although the beer smells and tastes sweet it is not cloying. This ale has a very slick mouthfeel with good carbonation. An excellent beer that is sweet and hoppy which is easy to drink.

Aroma is dominated by citrus (lemon and orange notes) as well as pine, with a slight caramel aroma underneath it. Taste features a prominent hop bitterness to begin, but is balanced a slight caramel sweetness and a short finish.

Hoppy smell is present, and the citrus is very nice. As the beer warms the citrus becomes more and more prevalent, nudging the score up a slight bit. The taste is something to behold. I gave this the full 5 and i don't question that rating one bit. Grapefruit is noticeable right off the bat, and while many times you hear the term "hop bomb" used to describe the strong taste that we come to associate with a good IPA, this is more of a "hop delivery". Every sip brings more wonderful hops taste without ever being overly strong or too bitter. A perfect taste every time, that feels just right. Great feeling, not too carbonated, and the aftertaste is almost as delicious as the taste. If i could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be a serious contender.

3.97,-7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a kind of pale color, still nice looking, crystal clear, until the last little bit of sediment falls in, then falls back out quickly. The head is massive, almost too big, but fits perfectly in my glass, almost an inch, maybe more, white and sticky, leaves lacing as it starts to collapse, lasts for a while. I can forgive the light color for the other nice aspects. The smell is very nice, just all centennial as far as I can smell. Flowers, resins, pollen, and a nice kick of lemon and tangerine. The malt provides a slight bready sweetness, but not sticky and bready like some. Great smell, though I might like a little more toasty malt. The taste is good, but it seems flatter on the hop front that the smell would suggest. I primarily get a light-bodies sweetness, with a strong bitterness with some slight floral, almost piney, leafiness. The fruit comes through a bit in the end, mangoes, oranges, a tiny bit of grapefruit, then it finishes with a very light, kind of sugary, though still containing some bitterness, malt body. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin. Not much breadiness, mostly some slightly sugar syrup kind of flavors. I would like a bit more. The carbonation is right on, a slight bite as it goes down. The ABV is a little higher than I'd like, though it's less apparent in the taste than I expected. Still, very enjoyable, one of the better IPAs out there, but there seems to be a bit of room for improvement.","taylorhamrick","Dec 01, 2009"

An inviting aroma of fresh hops, particularly a bitter orange peel and grapefruit flavor. Those aromas carry through on the flavor with the addition of a nice malt body to counterbalance. There's a sugar cookie sweetness derived from the malt that's very pleasant and does wonders to soften the hops. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly with a highly refreshing finish that's dry but not abrasively. A great IPA for hopheads and novices alike. There's an unmistakable fresh hoppy quality that makes this a nearly flawless representation of an American IPA and yet I found it had a great malt balance, more so than many others of equal repute. A must try, for sure.","apbarwood","Oct 30, 2009"

4.85,13.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Fantastic example of the style and one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Nice big three finger head, just enough to build a modest, yet picturesque crown atop the pint glass. Nice alabaster foam to a golden orange body. Nose is very aromatic and inviting offering vanilla cake batter and fresh pineapple. The lace is thin in some spots and chunky in others, overall it is prominent and appreciated as it clings in irregular sheets to every surface it contacts. The taste is all ripe pineapple on top of vanilla ice cream, freshly ground tangerine peel and bitter, pithy, pink grapefruit. Hop presence is big, only slightly bitter and very mellow in general while still at the forefront of the beer. Citrus is well balanced with the pine and spruce notes leaving many flavor combinations up to individual interpretation. The mouthfeel is spectacular. Medium-heavy, rolls nicely on the tongue with small bubbles, a crisp carbonation and it manages to be lively on the palate while being smooth as silk concurrently. The most sessionable IPA I can remember drinking, so hoppy, smooth and flavorful-I really wish it was available in Texas.","natelocc787","Oct 08, 2009"

Pine is the first thing you get upon tasting, strong enough to separate the men from the boys. Gradually the citrus aftertaste hits, so that what at first seems hoppy & biting loses some of its edge, in a good way. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, tart but smooth.

Very nice hazy golden body with a big, fluffy white head that laces incredibly. Smells hugely of citrus. Grapefruit galore and pine, with a tiny bit of pot thrown in for good measure. Slightly sweet, biscuity malt, which detracts from it a bit. Initial malty-sweet taste, though with a general citric hoppiness. Grapefruit and orange juice with some pine resin. Bitter, but not overly so. This seemed too malty up-front, but the dry finish keeps it pleasant and refreshing, in the end. Medium-full body with plenty of carbonation. A nice ale, but not the magnificent creation it's cracked up to be. Ironically, the Hemingway story wasn't great either; guess I'm a bit picky as a Hem fan though.

The gorgeous smell was probably the Two Hearted's highest high: peachy and apricot-y floral hops that are downright memorable. Tastewise, less bitter than many in the style, slightly fruity, with enough flavor on both the hop and malt ends to go around. My otherwise bitter- and IPA-hating friends enjoyed this a lot, actually, but don't take that to mean that it's not definitely an IPA - it's just that well balanced. It was a bit heavier-bodied and creamy than I'd expected I suppose but that was, again, definitely working in the beer's favor, and I can say the drinkability should at this point be a foregone positive.

As soon as you smell it, you know you are in for a delicous hop-flavored treat. The taste is grapefruit predominant but not overpowering by any means. This isn't a beer that wrecks your palate, and I mean that in a good way. Not every IPA style beer needs to be a total hop bomb. This has such a clean and refreshing flavor and mouthfeel, it is probably the most drinkable IPA I've had. I could spend many an hour on a summer day with a few of these, and will.","SwiftyMcBeer","May 04, 2009"

Mild hops in the nose as well. Sweet and hoppy attack which is an interesting combination and I would dare say is nicely balanced. Tartness to the flavor due to the hops character. The finish is clean but with a sour aftertaste as the mouth dries. The components of this beer are very interesting and it comes across as complex and interesting.

While I was disappointed I wasn't able to try the much ballyhooed Hop Slam, I thought this was an extremely drinkable, nicely balanced IPA, more akin to the NW style than the in yo face hopability of SoCal IPAs.

Also a nice floral hop presence with pine and slight hints of bubblegum. Mouth-feel is rather thin, but has some hop oiliness that coats the palate. Tastes are grapefruit, pine, and also has some floral notes from the hops. Hop bitterness is present, but well balanced by the fruity sweetness.

The flavor has an excellent malt backbone that lies beneath a bouquet of hop notes that tend toward the bitter citric end of the spectrum. The smell is a bit more floral than the flavor.

The nose offers up sweet pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus in spades, wheat, rye and soda bread notes, brawny apricot, peach, pineapple fruit scents, warm spring day explosion of fresh flowers, digs in without bruising. Medium-bodied, lively and energetic from the first sip to last, the carbonation dances a tango across the tongue. The pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus slightly more bitter here, just as much as an overpowering presence. Pretty peach, apricot, pear fruit, swells until pine sap, rye and granola in addition to a malt smoothness brings things closer to earth and elongates the experience into more than a series of punctuation marks.

They lack the symphonic multi-layered hop flavors that the aroma suggested. A nice dry finish. Light on the palate. Mouthefeel has some problems though.

It's a big-hopper, for sure, but it has a better balance and doesn't assault your taste buds like Hercules or Ruination. Citrus and pineapple are refreshingly pleasant, and the malt is right where it needs to be. To echo another review, it's so enjoyable that the glass is empty before you're ready, and you definitely want another.

Those tangerine, fruity notes being giving off by the hops hit you up front with a mild malt sweetness present in the middle to the end. It wasn't very bitter for an IPA but the aroma hops were very evident. This beer contains a light to medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer hides its 7.0% abv very well and is dangerously drinkable. This beer is unlike any other IPA I have personally have had before because it seems to focus on aroma hops and really backs off on the bittering.

Hop smell is a delicious dry hopped woodsy, piney smell. Pours to orange-yellow with a foamy two finger head that laces as it recedes. Taste is a very different hop taste than I have ever tasted before. Initial, but not for long, taste is malty, then the hops kick in. Again almost pine like hop that builds and builds in flavor, but not really bitter. It lingers in the finish but it still lets a slight bit of malts through. Silky mouthfeel but still a slight carbonation zest. This is a very different ale. Unique. The AC is not evident at all. I like it and will definitely be purchasing more of this brew. Drinkability suffers a tad for the AC but hey, if you wanna play you gotta pay. Oops it's gone! I now see on the bottle it's a Yooper style beer, that's why it's so good!

Sweet malts also insert themselves into the aroma equation. A resinous, medium full body with a lot of malt/hop tug of war on the palate, finishing dry, with an orange zest that hangs on for a bit.

Poured in to my new Cisco Brewery tulip glass a radiant gold, with about two fingers worth of white heading. Lots of small sediment can be seen floating around this beer if you look closely enough. Aroma is very floral, with hints of honeysuckle, a bit of garlic, and some citrus fruit thrown in the the mix. The floral part of it comes full swing in the flavor, with lots of lemon grass, earthy hops, bright citrus and oily resins. Body is about medium for an American IPA, just about right. The 7.00% ABV does not make itself known at all in the flavor. I am glad I finally got to try this one from Bells. It has a really spot on hop profile that you do not see in many IPAs on the East Coast. If I see this one at Extreme Beer Fest, I will be rushing over to grab some straight away.

Aroma is strongly of piney hops, resembles the white pine Christmas tree I have yet to take down, with some breadiness and even a little bit of smoke. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a little slippery and syrupy with well-balanced medium carbonation. Taste is like the nose, with piney hops, a lot of bready maltiness, nuts, and wood, finishes dry with good hop bitterness. Overall I this is a great brew and exactly what I expected for the style. Good balance in the taste, with hops that are not overly bitter. Drinkability is very good due to the good balance, and improves as it warms a bit and the flavors develop.

Awesome, awesome aroma...it just beckons to you! Flavor of hops upfront, followed by sweet malt with some wheat notes at the finish. Also got some lemon zest.

IPAs should have a nice big hoppy nose in my opinion, and this one doesn't go away from it, but what is different about this beer is the type of hops that come out; it's a fruity mixture with the malts, which I like quite a bit. The taste of two hearted isn't exactly what one would expect from an IPA, but that doesn't mean it's not great. The bitterness comes through at the end but the flavour is kind of like the nose, meaning that the hops and the malts play off of each other in a way that neither of them are in control of the beer; however, it's still quite obvious the beer is an IPA though. It also has a nice sweetness that comes through, which is kind of unexpected, but ace nonetheless! The mouthfeel is what an IPA should be! Very fucking drinkable!","swizzlenuts","Nov 28, 2008"

Brilliant piney hops shooting through with grapefruit citrus tones at their side. Very floral, probably the most floral single IPA I've ever had. A very crisp and well-balanced nose. The hops seem to be as well used in bell ipas if not better than any I've tasted. They just strike the perfect note here for me; piney, farmhouselike, and faintly smoky at the end. Citrus is still present, grapefruit in this case. A mild nuttyness. This is one distinct ipa and really something special. Mouthfeel is a very crisp and deliberate light-medium body.

There's almost a juciness to the mouthfeel from the flavorful hops and semi-sweet "graham cracker-like" malts.

Nice, if it is a hop explosion that you seek. Hop flavour is actually much more modest than I was anticipating up front, then becoming a bit more assertive in the middle, with a nice, even if a little muted, malt character showing itself a few seconds after you swallow. Somewhat balanced, I suppose. A good beer that I am very glad I finally got the opportunity to try.","SilentSabre","Aug 22, 2008"

The drinkability is high on this one. I could easily drink three of these but the abv is too high for it to be a session beer for me. This beer is very well balanced and has a clean taste to it.

It was oily with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was much better than my first sampling. It was delicious and clean and makes me want to drink more and more of it.

There's a candy malt touch but it's very light. This is a bright bitterness with fine carbonation, easy drinking if you're fond of hops. I get a slight popcorn sense under the bitterness. The feel is fairly medium body for a brew that is so sharp. This didn't strike me as being quite so good as it is on tap.

5,17.1,5,5,5,5,5,"This is my go to beer when I don't know what I want. Every time I pop a new one it reminds me of what beer can be. Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a hazy, raw honey orange with a billowing 2 finger head that left sticky lacing down the chalice. The aroma is a explosion of citrus. Grapefruit is predominant with bits of orange and lemon. Also sweet grassy notes come through on the finish. The taste is what hops done correctly taste like. Grapefruit and lemon balance with just a bit of spicy/grassy notes. All the hops are balanced extremely well with a malty sweetness that comes out on the finish. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a wonderful coating of hoppy bitterness all around your mouth. This beer isn't a hop monster, its well balanced and goes down smoothly. The only knock is it comes in a little high on the alcohol content to be a session beer. Thanks Bell's Brewery for making one of the Worlds best beers.","hwwty4","Jun 05, 2008"

Gathering from that opening statement, yup, this is going to be a very positive light shone on the beer that is Two Hearted. Spicy Orange Marmalade. 'Nuff said. Really. That was and still is the first thing that hits me when I drink this exquisite IPA. The honeyed citrus stampedes out of the glass on an aromatic mission to assault your olafactory glands. Luck for me I am a beer masochist. Then you drink it and the barrage of zest simply continues. But all of this hop juice is held in check by an assertive, smooth and full-bodied malt backbone. The finish is crisp, fragrant and your brain's que to hurry up and raise the glass to your mouth again. So drinkable, and even better when you can get it in the 5 ltr. party kegs. Whaaa? Yup, this purty little thang is now available in a jolly little aluminum barrel of joy. Well, not specifically RIGHT now, as Bells puts Two Hearted keg production on temporary hiatus while they crank out the Oberon mini-kegs, but come Fall they will be back.

The smell is probably the best I've ever experienced in an IPA. A great blend of those bitter hops with a strong citrus accent to it. Taste is incredible too. Very well balanced, obviously it leans more to the hop side but the hops arent overly dominant. They are there and present, but there is a malty sweetness to it as well. Taste very "fresh" and clean, just a great IPA. Carbonation is moderate and I'd say a medium mouthfeel to it. There is a slightly bitter, oily hop residue left behind.

This pours a light body that is slightly orange, slightly gold with a nice head that has a good deal of substance and fantastic lacing. The smell is of hops, mainly citrusy but also with floral and a bit of pine. Fantastic. This is repeated in the taste. Light bodied enough to be very drinkable, and the drinkability is only enhanced exponentially by the delicious taste. Good enough to serve as a thirst quencher. I can't think of a scenario that this beer wouldn't compliment whether it be a sunny day outside or a lazy day on the couch watching ball games. IMO, it doesn't get much better than this.

4.17,-2.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a light orange/straw color with a good sized fluffy head. Smell is amazingly floral with a titch of maltiness. Taste is most exceptional, big floral hops with some citrus oil (think orange peel). Malts don't make their presence till its time to swallow and its only a flash. Even though it is unbalanced it pulls it off really well. I wish there was a little more body to it but then again the lightness keeps it sessionable. Very good beer.","timbro81","Mar 10, 2008"
4.42,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Fantastic. My favorite american IPA. All around a great beer. Has a heavy piney, floral taste that is smooth and not too bitter for the amount of hops. A beer you can sip on all night (the ABV sneaks up on you). One of my overall favorite beers. Very well-balanced for an IPA with this much hop character.","jbm5","Mar 09, 2008"

Probably made with cascade hops and a strong hop flavor. Perfect for hop heads like me. I love the packaging too,I think bell's should make this their flagship beer and change their other ones to follow the lead.If you like this beer a close second is Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA","StrangeBrew1","Mar 06, 2008"
5,17.1,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall: Thanks to Markgugs for generously hooking me up. The last time I had this beer, it was the first IPA that I enjoyed. I can see how it would have started me down the hop road. I love hops now. I rated this beer lower than I know it deserves because of my inexperience. Now I simply love it. My last review will not be deleted though since it was a valid review when I had a different taste.","OStrungT","Mar 05, 2008"

4.15,-2.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - overall, two hearted ale on tap has some aspects better than the bottle and some worse. Thought the taste was mildly better as the hops seemed to pop a bit more. However, I didn't get the smell or the look of the beer that I got in the bottle. Couldn't get the hops smell to be as strong even after letting it warm up to room temperature. Overall, though this was a very good beer and one of the hits from Bell's which to me always seems like a hit or miss brewery. I would definitely get this again if it were on tap and would always pick up some bottles as a beer to just relax and drink.","jeonseh","Mar 02, 2008"

Still, extremely drinkable and pleasant.","JDV","Feb 24, 2008"

It'll make a hop addict yearn for the close, but a wheat beer aficionado will be confused by the bitter aftertaste.

Very sharp bitter hop bite jumps out first, but surprisingly not much malt balance comes through. All bitter grapefruit citrus flavor, but almost seems metallic without a sweeter foundation. This beer comes off a little astringent. Medium-bodied, good carbonation. Definitely good to get your hop craving out of this beer, but a little too harsh to go for more than one or two. I know this beer gets outstanding reviews, but I can't put it at the top of my IPA lists. But all in all, not a bad IPA.","IgnatiusReilly","Feb 11, 2008"

4.38,2.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a delicious and interesting IPA. It poured very nicely with a generous but not overdone head and a mild copper color. The taste was an explosion of citrus hops and grapefruit. It didn't have a strong malt backbone to provide balance, but the choice to keep out some of the more piney flavors makes this beer a very drinkable, warming, and refreshing IPA. I'd definitely drink it again.","cbleary","Feb 10, 2008"

Color is a bright amber with a chunky white head. Lacing like crazy here. Smell is of fresh, crisp hops. Very complex. A vast array of fruits meet the nose, though mostly citrus. One of the most fragrant beers I've had (though HopSlam takes the grand prize there). Taste is loaded with bitter hops, though remains well balanced considering how hoppy it is. Medium body with satisfactory carbonation. Definitely one I will return to again and again, especially because it seems to show itself in unexpected places.","atrus138","Jan 29, 2008"

I think I was looking at Two Hearted Ale as a DIPA when I should have been looking at it as it truly is; a beautifully clean and satisfying IPA with an excellent balance of bitterness and floralness.

The head collapses fairly quickly, but this beer leaves some of the best lacing on the sides of the pint glass that I've seen. The nose makes itself known while pouring the beer into the pint glass. Heavy scents of pine, ripe grapefruit, and orange rind. The floral nose is well done and matches perfectly with the taste. The flavor profile is the winner for me here. Starts out with bitter hops but the delicate pale malt comes into play to round out the bitterness. Fresh citrus fruit flavor, pine, and the sweet malt just work so well. Medium body and medium carbination leaves a slight dry sensation after the drink. The mouthfeel is actually a little creamy as well. I could drink this pretty much anytime of the year. Great offering from Bell's.","TheodorHerzl","Dec 23, 2007"

Smells of grapefruit and hops. Taste is grapefruity, gets a little more grassy as it warms, but supported by a nice malt backbone. The sensations of freshly baked bread and oranges, and a sort of nice woody flavor are also apparent. This has none of the off-flavors that I've come across in some heavily-hopped pale ales.

Delicious citrusy aromas, where grapefruit seems to dominate the aroma hops. The hoppiness does not overpower some sweet maltiness that pulls through, even in the aroma. Same hop presence in the taste, but with a nice orange zest, balanced by the same sweet caramel, slightly bready maltiness that reminds me a little of the german malt profile common in oktoberfests. Hop oils leave a little bit of tanin feeling on your tounge. Yummy beer, very well carbonated. I have this 1.32 gallon keg between two of us for tonight...so pretty drinkable. I finish one and really want another. This is the IPA that I will use to judge every other IPA; so so close to perfect.","NCBeernut","Dec 15, 2007"

Seems some what tempered by sweet malt elements. The sweetness also hints at grapefruit and green apples. Mouthfeel is fairly full for such a hop centered brew. Finishes a bit tart.

Pours a beautiful slightly hazy golden with a very healthy head that sticks around and leaves some very nice lacing. The smellis wonderful. Deep and bright aromas of citrusy hops, some slight grassiness, and a slight hint of malt in the back to balance. Perfect ipa aromas in my book. The taste is also wonderful. The same wonderful citrus flavors and bitterness, a slight sense of graininess, and the hops turn earthy and spicy as the flavor goes on. Not the most bitter beer I've had, or the one with the longest finish, or the most perfectly balanced, but the overall package is nice- quite hoppy while retaining a certain subtlety. Very nice.

I have a very big soft spot for lakes and pines, and this beer hits home right off the bat. Pop the top off the bottle, and you're immediately hit with this intense, fruity/floral hoppy blast. This beer smells amazing. It pours a bright and opaque golden orange, with a thin bubbly head. Upon the first sip, your mouth is met with an intense but pleasant hop burn. I've had some IPAs that hurt to drink, but this one is definitely much more friendly. As the hops disappear, they are replaced by a sweet grapefruit flavor, just about the most perfect fruity flavor in a beer that's not put there on purpose. The finish is thick and rich, with a sweet and spicy malt finish. You do this over and over and before you know it, your beer is gone and you are sad, because this one of the best-tasting beers that I (and apparently a lot of other people!) have ever had.

The aroma consists of floral, perfumy, and piney hops, white grapefruit, pineapple?, mango?, and a touch of biscuity malts. About the same in taste, with floral, citric, and piney hops leading the way, bringing with them a hefty bitterness that is only lightly balanced by the malts.

Powerful scents of floral and citrus, strong hops, the nose is much better this time then out of the bottle. Tastes of strong citrus and powerful dry and bitter hops immediately followed by delicious malts. The carbonation is very low which allows more flavors to present themselves. Dry finish is perfect, no bitterness at all. An impeccable brew with an improved twist from the cask. MMM","franksnbeans","Aug 11, 2007"

Fresh grapefruit and pine and spiciness. A solid tasting beer, sweet pale malt under a great hop punch. It tastes perfectly balanced, full bodied, hoppy, has everything going for it. The mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of carbonation to keep it slightly dry and refreshing. Great flavor, not so much hops that you can't taste anything else. Very nice example of the style.","BigBry","Aug 05, 2007"

Very gentle nose. Starts a little sweeter than your standard IPA which I like. It transitions slowly to a medium hop bitterness in the end. Very nice balance and more drinkable than most other IPAs. In fact, I think this IPA has better drinkability than Dogfishhead 60min. That says a lot being that Dogfish IPA is one of my absolute favorite beers period.","rborthwick","Aug 03, 2007"

It's got a nice "kick" from the 7% ABV, but not where it overpowers the flavor. Great "drinkablility", that's to say it tastes great.

But its not an in-your-face tongue massacre, its loads of fresh, oily hop flower power. Like candied grapefruit, but never heavy and cloying, the filling mouthfeel is surprisingly easy to handle .

Taste is very similar to smell, but that isn't a bad thing. Very enjoyable to the taste buds. Some floral notes seem to arise as well on the tounge.

The hops seem more inviting rather than aggressive although they are there throughout. Taste is exceptional. Grapefruit citrus hops with a sweet floral aroma. Great hop bite that is lightly malted as well but the hops surely dominate. Mouthfeel is tingly from the hops, yet smooth as they come. Nice crisp finish that stays on the tongue forever it seems. Drinkability is through the roof as well. As I said above the hops are there and definitely dominate but they are balanced in such a way that makes this the most refreshing and drinkable IPA out there. This is one of my favorite styles and Two Hearted seems to set the bar pretty high. It doesn't look much better than your average, though you can't judge a book by its cover. Highly recommended.

Smell is perfect: many layers, but mostly floral hops of the cascade and fuggles variety, but also a certain sweetness that's hard to put your finger on. The taste is big and chewy, with the same hop character as in the smell. Terrifically balanced though, many times beers have a one-dimentional hop taste and this seems to totally buck that trend. As the glass empties the taste seems a little less spectacular but just as dense, a feat of a great beer.","Toddv29424","Apr 26, 2007"

Lots of bready/biscuity malt that is almost cookie like at times, other typical baking flavours come through, a little vanilla, caramel, and even a bit of banana surprisingly. Grainy in the finish with lots of hop bitterness. Well-balanced which I appreciate so much in an IPA. Not as dry as a lot of IPA's I've had but I don't mind that, although the carbonation could be toned down a little.

4.39,2.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Served on tap into a standard shaker pint glass. Appearance isn't thrilling... rather unremarkable golden color with some white head that disappeared quickly & left no lace. Smell is good ... full of citrusy/piney hop notes and a bit of the malt sweetness. Flavor likewise shows some of the malt notes (cereal/biscuit) & plenty of the floral/spicy/citrusy hops. Finish is dry and very hoppy. Very much balanced toward the hop-head's taste preferences (very unbalanced toward hop aroma, flavor and bitterness). Mouthfeel is smooth, body pretty much "medium" weight. One of my favorites in the style (along with Stone IPA, DFH 60 Minute). A decent choice for a session ale if you are a hop-head & also a good choice to recommend to people who appreciate hoppy beers or are willing to at least try to push their envelope further.","jsbrendle","Apr 13, 2007"

The taste starts with a strong malt flavor, and it dominates the palate till the very end, when that expected bitterness caomes in at the end. A thin watery feel, very surprising, folowed by the strong presence of carbonation at the back of the throat. An incredible aroma, is let down by a mediocre taste and less than appealing feel, was very disappointed, but I will probably give this beer another try.","cameraman","Apr 11, 2007"

A slight bread-like malt backbone can be noticed in the roof of the mouth right before a dry, hoppy finish that leaves you no choice but to take another sip.

When the glass is tilted, the lacing is patchy and slick. The nose is bitter and filled with citrus notes, and perhaps slight hints of white raisins. The taste is just on the bitter side of balanced, and reminds me of a rich white bread with marmalade. There's also a bit of pepper. Very nice. The mouth is quite thin, with perfect carbonation. Paired exceptionally with some sharp cheddar. I usually don't overly enjoy IPAs, and this bottle of the six pack, the very last, tasted much better than the others.

The taste is just perfect- fruity, perfume hops, without any astringent bitterness. Just amazing. Malts are then as a great backbone, but this beer is about the hops as it should be. The approachableness of the hops is what really sets this apart from the crowd. Any average non hop head can have a sip of this and say- this is a really tasty beer. That is an accomplishment that can't be understated- for the masses and for the hop head.

A nice two-finger head which lasted a while and left a beautiful lace down the glass. The aroma is very citrusy. Orange and lemon hoppiness. Tastes delicious too. The perfect blend of malt and hops. Very fresh. Orange hoppy flavor to finish it off. On a second gulp I get hints of lemon and starfruit. Some pine as well in the following aroma. A tasty and complex IPA for sure. Mouthfeel is solid.

A fantastic IPA made with all Centennial hops makes for a hop heads delight. Big grapefruity hops with just a touch of honey like sweetness to balance makes for a delicious IPA. Alcohol is well hidden. Visually this is one great beer as the clarity of the beer, the long lasting head and huge amounts of sticky lacing make it visually appealing. Two Hearted lives up to its billing as one of the best IPA's and one that has found a permanent home in my DBF. Drinkability factor is through the roof as I could drink these all day.

Not too bitter but not sweet at all. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry at the end. This is a very drinkable beer. The kind of AIPA that you can have many of.

This particular example was still sitting around even after the glass was empty. Aroma is definitely hoppy, and a bit sweet. Flavor is hops plus citrus and very pleasant.

Poured into a nonic, Two Hearted Ale is undoubtedly hazy, golden amber with a dense and rocky small white head and sticky lacing. Sparse carbonation. Profoundly zesty citric hop aromas, with grapefruit and pine notes abiding. A substantial caramel malt scent is also detectable. Sharp grapefruit bitterness leads the hop profile here, with young spruce cone and apricot flavors arriving late in the sip. Some mineral notes ride along with a rather understated caramel malt bill that is all but obliterated by the brash (but not overwhelming) hops. Bready aftertaste. Peppery mouthfeel, juicy too. Pretty dry finish -- actually, pretty dry overall. Very nice mouthfeel on this just about medium-bodied ale. This is a ridiculously flavorful IPA which makes it incredibly drinkable. Easily one of the best of its style in the world.","orfeu","Oct 07, 2006"

Tastes pungent, good bitter hops, a bit floral a little sweetness, some crispness and a very dry finish, not as clean as some others. This is a definitely a dry English style IPA.

Very strong hop aroma is one of the first things noticeable. The flavor is full of hops as can be expected, and I found citrusy overtones in the hop flavor, a nice blend of bitterness to round out the flavor. The beer has a medium body, so you could definitely drink a few of these without feeling "full". If you like a high hopped ale, this is very drinkable. I had two, and found by the end of the second one, I was starting to reach my limit on that particular hop flavor.

Definately worth a try, i was impressed by its aroma, and it may suit your fancy more than mine. Really makes me want their double IPA though, can see how it may more fully realize my ideal, only needing more ETOH and hops to round out the malt.","demcorhip","Jul 25, 2006"
4.17,-2.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"12 oz. bottle. Poured a slightly cloudy, orange gold color. Moderate head. Aroma was primarily grapefruit, with an undertone of honey. Taste was almost all hops, with a mixed citrus (oranges and grapefruit flavor). Malt was in a supporting role, and didn't add a whole lot to the flavor, IMO. Medium body, with moderate to high carbonation, drying in the mouth leaving you wanting more. An excellent beer, and as I sit here and look at my glass, I wish I had bought more than 2.","","Jul 24, 2006"

Aroma of floral hops is quiet enticing with a great semi-sweet malt base. Taste of crisp and citrus hops are well mixed with a nice solid sweet malt based. Carbonation is lively and body is about average. Overall a really good example and enjoyable take on the style thought a bit overrated in my opinion.","Phyl21ca","Jul 24, 2006"
2.46,-42.4,4,3,2,3,2,"Henceforth I'm going to call this beer Fishbine. Not because it tastes like fish but because even the fish on the label ain't biii-ne into the hype of the Two Hearted Ale by Bell's. Bell's makes great beer but they also make craft beers and in doing so there are always extremes. Much more brusk than the aftertaste of Oberon, this beer has a citrus bite that rivals the pungent meat of the rind. It literally is rind beer. I know that it is lauded as a summertime delicacy but it is more like drinking the broth of a lemorange peel that sat out in the sun too long and then was chilled. No goodness here.","thelagerheads","Jul 22, 2006"

Malt aromas are present but quickly fade due to the hop aromas. Something seems off in the flavor. I think it is too unbalanced. Yes, it is supposed to heavy on the hop side but its kind of harsh. I think it just needs a bigger malt presence. The hop amounts are fine, as is their flavor, its just a weak malt presence. It is still a good and quality made beer just unbalanced IMHO. If the malts were a bit more dominate, it would make an excellent brew.","sabrills70","Jul 14, 2006"

Nose is ...oh man ... hops are superbly aggressive here. Citrus, piney, and ever so slightly sweet. Can they bottle this aroma and sell it in a spray like Febreze? One of the best smelling beers I've enjoyed in a long while. Palate is a hop paradise ... pine and citrus combine with an incredible sweetness and texture that almost brings a tear to the eye. This may well be the best balanced AIPA I've ever had ... could the hop/malt ratio be better? Doubt it. Mouthfeel is soft, thick, and luxurious. Medium bodied. Lingering sweetness and absolutely amazing hop tastes linger in the mouth long after each sip. Where do I begin with one ... you simply must have Bell's Two Hearted. I don't know why it's called Two Hearted and I don't know why there is a fish on the label, but I do know it's the best AIPA I've ever had the pleasure of consuming ... and one of the overall best beers made in the USA. More than recommended.","beerphilosopher","Jul 13, 2006"

It is not one of the strongest IPA's when it comes to hops, and that's a good thing. There is a nice balance between the malts and the bittering and finishing hops.

I am not an avid IPA drinker but this one is tops in my book. A full body of flavors and characters revisiting the smells.

The bittersweet hoppiness fades into a smooth creaminess then into an almost buttery aftertaste that lingers the whole sitting. I'm going out on a limb and saying this might be the top two or three most drinkable IPAs I've ever had.

By which I mean, hints of lemon and deep, dark pine. Taste is a centennial assault; big and orangey, lemony, again with a huge pine backup. The hop flavor tastes thick though the body is clean and crisp. Just a tinge of sweetness in the aftertaste, matched by a stiff bitterness that contributes to the "clean" feeling. Carbonation is actually a little low if anything - I could use a bit more fizz on the tongue to complement the stiff hop punch, but it's oh so drinkable as is.

We are starting to see this on tap at more and more places in Minneapolis, and not just dank beer bars anymore, so I have been drinking more and more of it, and boy, it just keeps getting better. The way Guiness defines stout, and Sierra Nevada defines pale ale, I feel that two hearted ale defines IPA. It pours the same amber color of most PA's, with a slight head that has great retention and provides lacing to the last sip. The aroma is where you find out it is IPA, not a PA, with a complex, hoppy smell. The taste follows up on the smell, an array of hops from piney to fruity to citrusy, that all blend together, with the dry-apple flavor following shortly.

The hops hit up front, but are followed by a toasted malt quality and a slight amount of sweetness. Finish is bitter and refreshing. Mouthfeel is medum and a bit dry. Drinkablity is very good.

Taste is lemony, orange followed by a dash of bitter pine. The bitter is almost meek, as if trying to be inoffensive. This one manages to be very citrusy, without incorporating any grapefruit. It almost seems naked without the grapefruit. After those initial tastes, the back tastes like seltzer water. The malt doesn't really show other than to provide a bit of sweetness. In spite of that minor gripe, this is still a very enjoyable brew. Mouthfeel is near perfect, lush and creamy. If this were a local brew, I fear that it would be overshadowed by many of the premiere IPA's. Of the top of my head I can think of a couple that taste almost just like it. In any case, I did enjoy this and were it available here, I'd buy a sixer every now and then.","TheBungyo","Mar 26, 2006"

The head dances around a bit during drinking and this beer makes love to the side of the glass and doesn't want to let go. Like the bottle, huge pine and citrus in the nose. An absolute overflow of fresh hop flavor in the mouth with just the right amount of playfulness in the mouth, not enough to overwhelm the flavors.

Medium thick, good coating ability, nice light carbonation present. I would drink this all day long. Thanks Archer Liquors...","bennetj17","Mar 23, 2006"

Aromas of hops, alcohol, and ripe fruits. Citrus and grapefruit flavors along with the hops dominated the taste with a strong bitterness that lingers the whole time. Much more like hop juice than an IPA. Thin and dry in my mouth with a citrus-dervied finish. My biggest problem with this beer was it's lack of complexity. It truly bordered on pure hops and that's not a great thing.","jaluria","Mar 21, 2006"
4.79,12.2,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"David and I both really enjoyed this one. Had on tap a few times at the Fox and Hound in Beavercreek. Not quite crystal clear, pale gold in color. I think what makes this one stand out is you get two different hop impressions. Initially, the aroma brings it with strong flowery hops, with a second layer of grassy notes too, let's call it the meadow. This carries into the taste, which backs those impressions up with enough malt, and just a touch of sweetness. The finish is more of a citrusy hop taste. A strong medium body, enough carbonation, you have a very drinkable brew.","PatandDavid","Mar 19, 2006"
3.97,-7,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a light copper to gold color with a creamy head that dissipates quickly. Smells of light caramel mixed with the scent of mouth watering sweet floral hop goodness. Taste is at first citrusy with grassy-ness with strong bitterness that lingers on the tongue with a very slight alcohol warmth. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel. My memory of this beer was more balanced but in reviewing it today the hop bitterness was very prominent. A solid IPA from Bell's that I am sure I will drink many more of.","hoppymeal","Mar 19, 2006"

This is the most I've noticed floral in a beer that i can remember. Taste is initially bitter up front and then becomes somewhat earthy. I want to say hay or that first cutting of wet springtime grass. Very interesting beer. I don't know that i've tasted an IPA like this before. There is enough of the hop note that it fits the category but there is definately something unique about this beer. As the beer warms a bitter aftertaste becomes more noticable. Is that now a piney note coming through in the finish. What an interesting beer. I have a couple more of these and i'm looking forward to exploring this one a little bit more.","beermanbrian","Mar 16, 2006"

The smell of whole hop cones are very apprent in the nose, fruity and herbal, with a hint of pine. Toasted amber malt and a slight ester begin the flavor, and a citrus/pine alpha-oil hop aftertaste balances the taste without drying it out. Light carbonation and medium body allow an uncommonly smooth mouthfeel for a I.P.A.; bitter without becoming harsh.

Taste is extraordinary, with the fruitiness in the foreground, but mellowed by a distinct hop essence. What an absolutely magnificient combination. Drinkability is absolutely perfect.

Taste is absolutely incredible, excellent balance between hops and malt, yet far more complex, it's like nothing I've tasted before. At first taste, this IPA tarts off with a quick hoppy bite that is rich in citrus and floral notes, before giving way to a softer, caramelly sweet maltiness that leaves you wanting more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slick on the tongue, coats the mouth with a nice light oily feeling.

Nice frothy head that turns quickly into a white ring leaving lacing down the glass. Aroma is rough hewn and woody. Flavor is hoppy,less malty, with hints of citrus and apple.

Beautiful orange tone to this one, and a huge, solid, rocky head that maintains it's shape for a while and then fades to a still substantial foam that lasts til the final sip. Mmmm. In terms of smell and taste, this is a perfectly balanced beer, yet robust in both the malt and hop areas. I generally don't draw comparisons between beers, but I like this just about as much as the Alesmith Yulesmith, which I couldn't help but be reminded of while drinking this beer. They both have that great almost vanilla ice cream sweet malt character backing up a load of hops. Very resinous and oily hops in the nose, and also on the palate, but moving towards a more citrusy orange peel and spice bouquet. Also, I could be imagining this but I'm detecting either some light spicing, or just little complexities such as clove and nutmeg. Really nice. This is pretty much a medium bodied beer but it has a great slightly thick and sticky mouthfeel, super creamy and smooth. I know this is tough or nearly impossible to find on the east coast, but if you find some on your travels definitely pick it up, it's one of the best IPAs I've had.

Its almost like potpourri, quite an accomplishment. The body is best described as medium with a mouthfeel that's full of a good juicy malt character. The hop character in the beer itself is a pleasant combo of citrus and floral notes, really the perfect marriage. Also adding to the intrigue is the complex sugary balance, which is outstanding.

Smells of piny, floral, citrusy hops with a very slight funkiness to it. I like it. First up there's very soft bready malt then an incredibly full, round, lush(but not at all aggressive) orangy pine hop flavor takes over my mouth. Bready malts and a nice medium creamy mouthfeel support it throughout. An interplay of spicy hops and pale toasted malts linger on in the finish. This is really terrific. Such a round, full, yet subtle flavor. Drinkable to the end. Best IPA i've had yet; what it lacks in aggression is made up with its cunning subtlety. Sadly I only have one more bottle.","numenor1","Sep 06, 2005"

Very green and rich and vibrant and earthy. Feels like I am hiking in oregon again. Great balance with the malts too. Just enough sweetness to not allow the bitters to be overpowering. Just little bits of citrus rinds too. Do they also cask condition this ale? I wish, I surely wish... Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice and dry finish.

As I pour this golden brew into a straight-sided pint glass, I can't help but notice the massive hop aroma; a pine forest full of aroma, accented by a little citrus. the carbonation seems good and the beer displays a good head of foam that settles to thin layer, leaving lacing down the sides of my glass. Love that hop aroma! As a homebrewer, I'm guessing that Bell's added a lot of Centennial hops late or after the boil. After smelling hops, I get to taste 'em and the resiny hop flavor nearly overcomes the presence of some good honey-ish malt and slightly toasted malt flavors. All of this leads to a big bitter finish. Perhaps not the most complex IPA, but when consumed this fresh this beer is a joyous hop explosion!","marcobrau","Aug 08, 2005"

Super sweet and fruity hop aroma, can't wait. Damn, this doesn't disappoint, either. A tasty, sweet, doughy maltiness is present but is beaten severely by the copious hops. Highly herbal and lemony, the bitterness is matched by a good measure of sweetness. As the glass empties, a serious coating of lace is left cemented to the inside. The finish is dry and bitter, but not at all unpleasant. I've not usually been much of a hop head, but this was delicious and amazingly drinkable.

Starts off pouring a hazy-orange nectar, with a full-sized head. Bubbles lace the concoction from bottom to top, actively flowing through the glass. The smell is dominated by citrus aromas, along with a slight floral hint. Citrus again is most prominent in the overall taste, along with a notable malty kick. This is not the world's hoppiest I.P.A., but does have a bit of a bite to it. The best way to describe it is smooth to the extreme. In mouthfeel, it is full, but not overly heavy. Its carbonation remains throughout and the citrus flavors that come along with initial sips hold well throughout. There is a slight bitterness at the end of each quaff, adding to its appeal. Overall, I would say that this is an excellent beer, whose complexity and smoothness make it one to experience regularly.","macpapi","Jul 20, 2005"

Even more noticeable is this beer's candy-like smell with some sort of strange interplay between the malts and the wonderfully smelling floral hops. Smells more like a gumball to me than Gumballhead! Taste is where it comes together in an interesting almost butterscotch candy sweetness (diacetyl alchohol) washed back with those bitter hops! I'm not sure if this is one of the great before or after dinner beers. Despite it's paler appearance this is one rich and filling beer at 6.0% abv.

Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a steady stream of tiny bubbles journeying upward toward a creamy, small but mighty head. Smells like a barrel of fresh hop flowers - seriously. It's maybe the most floral smelling beer I've ever had. The smell was so floral, it actually caused a sensory flashback to my days of homebrewing. Wicked. While still mostly floral, as it sat for a bit, a sweet apricot smell also began to emerge as well. Phew. Taste was as expected but somehow less severe than its aroma forecast: Way spicy up front, coupled with some sweet flavors that sit back and let the hops take charge but still keep them in some sort of balance. Can't put my finger on the sweet flavors but thankfully they're there. Maybe it's a kiss of honeysuckle. Finish is of sour lemon and then a puckering, bitter finish that forces another sip almost immediately after swallowing. If you let the bitterness sit in your mouth, it overtakes it and lasts and lasts and lasts, revealing some piney flavors late in the taste. For the first time in my life, I can't honestly say the hop burps sent a rush of tears into my eyes. Mouth is a creamy medium-bodied and chock full o' tightly knit, miniscule bubbles... a blanket of effervescence.

Taste is hops herbal spicy mixture nice flavors mingle with biscuity malt, almost taste like some pepper present nice light clean tasting little IPA, lightly bitter after taste but no real pine resin at all.

While many IPAs hit with bitter and finish with a citrus and faint malt, this beer is incredibly well blended. As the hop bitter strikes, it is accompanied by grapefruit and smooth enticing barley sweet. I taste lighter fruits in the background. Apricot? Certainly some pear. As a homebrewer, I know the difference between fresh and aged beers. This beer was fresh and delicious. A+. I'll be stopping in every trip home for another.

The malt is in there, but the hop dominates so that the caramel just seems to fade into the back. Damn I do like this beer. One of the better IPA's I've had in a while.

(I'm a hop head) After being a little disappointed with the aroma, the taste made up for my disappointment. A very good hop bitterness, more than most IPA's. The hop bitterness jumps out at you, making this a hop lovers delight. It tastes a little thicker (more mouthfeel) than alot of the other IPA's.

Very hoppy aroma with citric and floral hops coming out in abundance. There was a slight hint of malt to it at times. Taste was very similar very hoppy all the way through this one with citric and earthy flavors coming together for a great taste. A bitter hoppy aftertaste is how this ended.

It had some sweet cirtic bites that went well with the hops. An overall great IPA. I wish I was back in Michigan and could find it on tap.

Following, more hops just come into play leaving a zesty piney flavor that just lingers on the tongue. This beer finishes hoppy and sweet, with some more zest and yet a final lingering bitterness that just makes it perfection.

Don't get me wrong, this beer brings the hops, but a caramel malty presence makes itself known. Citrus fruit abounds in the flavor as well, and this seems to be slightly fuller and creamier than many of its other American counterparts. Very very well balanced, though being the hop addict I am I could ask for a bit more in the bitterness department.

There is definite bitterness as well that is quite delightful, also a bread-like characteristic. Nice carbonation that sparks the flavor.

The hops do a dance in the mouth which goes as: First to play is flavorful, floral to citrusy hop then blends nicely into a tangy bitterness, which melts and coats the mouth.

Smells like what I would imagine something out of the DFH Randall would. The taste is as well all about the hops, but there is enough pale malts to round the corners and keep the taste buds alive. Also slight citrus notes are present. It impresses me that such a hop monster remains quite smooth and imminently drinkable.","ppoitras","May 06, 2004"

3.64,-14.8,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"So in my glass is the famous Two Hearted IPA. It looks good, potent dark sun yellow, lightly hazy, with a great very foamy and rocky white head, highly carbonated in appearance. Acute citrusy C-hops nose, very flowery, sweet, sour, hints at lemon pie, lilac (orval anyone?), grapefruit, grass. Solid toasty/cookie malt attack early like a good pils, quickly complemented by the direct floral and citrusy hops. Great flavor development for an IPA, but you know where they're from, hophead's neck of the wood and always lacking a touch of "multidimensionality". Tremendous velvety texture, less carbonated than anticipated. Clean and long oily bitter finish. Quite good, but top 100 in the world? I think not. Maybe a top 10 IPA though.

The first couple of sips were a little jarring, but once my taste buds got comfortable I started to feel the overall balance and crispness of the brew. Still, a little too heavy on the citrus aspect and after about 2 I was done. This is a great IPA but I did not find this to be my favorite style of IPA overall -- there is something different between the East Coast brewer's IPA's (Sly Fox, Victory) and the West Coast (other area's) which I can't put my finger on but I know I like the East Coast's IPA brews better (more balance, malt, not as much citrus/acidic taste?).","Gasp100","Feb 28, 2004"

There is a light sweetness which contributes to the citrusy hop flavor quite a bit. It is pretty bitter in the finish as well. The hops are not totally dominated by citrus though, there is some herbal notes, some hop spicines, and some notes of pine here as well. In the end a fairly dry beer, but made so because of the generous hopping. There is some malt sweetness here which helps to hold up the hop onslaught. The hops set a tingling sensation to my tongue, that screams pay attention to my hoppiness. This is a great everday beer, though perhaps it is just missing some slight amount of hop flavor & malt backbone to push it over the edge.","Gueuzedude","Feb 05, 2004"

So, too, was the taste; there's a lot going on here: a good blend of soaring hops upon a foundation of subtle malts. And right at the end, a bready yeastiness lingers.

Taste is a real surprise given the aroma, very chewy malty taste that is then devoured by the hop backnote.

Aroma is mouthwatering floral hops and just a little bit of yeast. Taste is intitially agressively grapefruit/citrus hoppy but somehow soft at the same time, giving amazing hop flavor without being overly bitter.

Aroma: Piney with an edge of sweet peach juice malted like an extract form the hops hold dominance on all other competitive components, but citrus orange peel and flower cascades all come to play at this hop gathering. Even after getting the bottle as empty as I could, I smelled inside the bottle to be greated with a robust rush of hops, now that's what I call hop aroma. Flavor: Simply crisp bitterness blended with a malt backbone not as syrupy sweet compared to the likes of a barley wine esque Double IPA but this one holds it's ground as being one of the best IPAs I have ever tasted. Such a good IPA wish I had this one at my disposal, because this is a buy by the case beer all the way. The layers of different hops that harmonize here is uncanny I can literally pick out seperate hop components earthy tones, pine cone like, flowery, citrus zest it's all here this beer is amazing. Mouthfeel: Carbonation solid all the way through body is medium to light I wish there was just a tad more texture my only complaint.

Sweet malts were present, but the main part of the flavor had a spicy, orange peel taste with some hints of honey. Very weird.

The taste was like nothing I've ever experienced, especially for a guy accustomed to the rich, cascade-hopped west coast IPA's. Is there molasses in this brew? It definitely has a distinct and complex recipe of hops and malt working here. It was a very good ale, but I can't understand all the hype and why so many BA's rank this as high as they do.

I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is just another horribly over hopped American ale. I know it's an IPA and hoppiness is a characteristic of the style, but I just don't think there is enough maltiness and body in this brew to support all the hops. All I can taste is a sickening amount of floral and citrus hops. To me it seems very unbalanced and astringent.

The body was dark gold to light amber and somewhat hazy. Nose was full and gave off piney, herbal hop aromas that carried through to the taste. A flowery sense was included in both nose and taste. This is a hophead ale to be sure, but creamy and full bodied to boot. Very little malt sense, but, of course, that is what carries the hops forward. Not overly bitter at any point, the brew finishes with a hint of lip-licking sweetness that balances the overall experience. This would not be the top IPA on my list, and I've probably rated it higher than I'd otherwise rate it because of the cask influence.

I have grapefruit, orange, mango, and lemon trees in my back yard!). The hops certainly are present, but unlike a beer like Rogue IPA, the hops don't push the flavor to the background. Pours a nice, foamy head - with good retention. Cloudy, orange hue. Both refreshing and substantial. It was great to have a highly rated micro brew that lives up to it's reputation.

The bite of the hops is very potent and even after making great efforts to sample other IPAs, this one stands alone and the novelty of the wonderful blend of powerful citrus taste and hops has not worn off after over a year of sampling other hops-laden brews.

The aroma is very sweet bubble gum with a strong lemon-pine hop presence. The sweetness is evident on the pour, and as you carry the glass to your seat. I wanted to take a drink immediately! Who needs notes anyway, right? The first drink is truly heavenly, with a great malt sweetness sparked by a terrific hop bite. What a dichotomy of tastes that somehow blend together perfectly! Very strong citrus notes are prevalent in subsequent quaffs, but the malt is never forgotten. The finish is exceptionally smooth and clean for such a flavorful beer. All that is left is a hint of fruitiness and a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very rich and supple, while not becoming too heavy as the beer is finished. Drinakbility is terrific, but I only had one! So I made it last as long as possible. I'm not sure if the "two hearted" refers to the strong prescence of both the malt and the hops. All I know is that the name had no meaning to me until know. My heart was swept away by this beer. By both the malt and the hops.

It eventually drops but keeps a really nice creamy collar, and a simple swirl of the glass brings it right back up! Additionally, it leaves some nice lace - although it's fleeting. The aroma, however, is even more astonishing than the appearance with a bright, bold combination of soft ripe fruit, tangy grapefruit and resiny pine. Intense! But it goes even one step further as the flavor is even bolder than the aroma with a searing bitterness right-up front, and from start to finish! If it weren't for the rich (almost sugary) and fruity (apricot, tangerine, mild pineapple) malt underneath this beer would be way too much! Surprisingly, and thankfully, the hop flavors are limited to the fruity side of things and the interplay between the crushing bitterness and the sweet malt is really interesting. It's kind of like a "tug of war" in the mouth. The firm maltiness is enlivened by a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation that helps this to happen. It's surprisingly smooth and creamy. This is one hell of a "take no prisoners" IPA that should clearly be sought out and destroyed - one bottle at a time! Most highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","Jan 06, 2003"

Hops, hops and more hops dominate the aroma but somehow they squeezed a little citrus in there too. The taste mirrors the smell. I was not dissapointed, left a nice tangy aftertaste. Pretty drinkable for the abv Way to go Larry!","cretemixer","Dec 18, 2002"
4.05,-5.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Hazy and light amber with a large, stiff, white head. Smelled like a good AIPA should, big citrus. Also, notes of yeast, grains, and some malt. Extremely well balanced beer (for an AIPA) with some toasty malt providing sontrast to the raw hop and alcohol flavors. Fairly light body and carbonation which I liked very much.","yen157","Dec 08, 2002"
4.97,16.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Simply put one of the best beers of any type I've ever had. Had a nice creamy head sitting on top of a brilliant cloudy beer. The taste and smell both yelled out hops! One of those beers a hophead would be more than happy to get ahold of, yet also has enough balance to even things out abit for something who is not a huge fan of hops. Bell's has done is again!","JoeyHotrod","Dec 05, 2002"
4.7,10.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"pours a cloudy yellowish-orange. the aroma of this beer is the first thing you notice...powerful citrusy hops. a nice, slightly off white head. taste is all hops....grapefruit, floral, a bit spicy...without any astrigent bitterness at all. the malt is there to offer a nice balance. this beer is very impressive...extremely balanced, with tons of hop flavor that is not harshly bitter at all. one of, if not the best american ipa i've had the pleasure to have, when it's "on". i've had a few samples in which the sweet fruitiness is muted and the bitterness more pronounced, which would knock it down some for me. when it's on target though, it is hard to beat.","pheurton","Nov 30, 2002"
4.97,16.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This may be my favorite IPA of all-time....Incredible nose...I get the huge citrus aroma with pineaples the predominant fruit...looks a little cloudy but a big rocky white head tops this bad boy....the nose invites you in, and then the taste takes over...no disappointment here....great hops flavor...all citrus...grapefruit the big one...also some pear core on the finish....malt doesn't assert itself but this is very balanced in the mouth...highly drinkable, particulary if you like hopped up beers....Next to some of their stouts this is without question their best beer.","ZAP","Nov 27, 2002"
4.6,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours cloudy copper color, citrus hoppy aroma, nice hop profile, crazy ass foamy clingy head. Juicy grapefruit-citrus flavors, medium bodied IPA with a nice rounded full mouthfeel, this may be the most drinkable IPA I have ever tasted, I just can't stop at one.","maxpower","Nov 20, 2002"

4.47,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice amber orange with a massive white head, Nice hoppy aroma, and a killer taste excellent hopiness, and a hint of Maudite?, I could be crazy, but one of the flavors I associate with Maudite is in there. Great hoppy beer to add to my arsenal.","jtw5877","Nov 16, 2002"
4.55,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Light golden hue w/ slight haze, topped by a creamy, cappachino like, sticky ivory white head. Trails of Belgian lace. Delectable combination of assertively citrusy hops, light caramel and mild tart fruity esters in aroma lend a vibrant, but rounded tangerine overtone. Crisp, sharp, hop bitterness hits the palate initially, then yields to citrus rind hop flavor w/ a distinct grapefruit note. Malt and yeast derived character is overshadowed by the strong hop profile, but notes of dextrinous light caramel and pearish tartness from Bell's yeast strain can be discerned. Well attenuated, dryish body. Finishes a lingering impression of lightly sugared pink grapefruit. Two Hearted is a delicious vehicle for Centennials. Malt is not showcased at all in this brew, yet manages to adequately support the assertive hopping. Superbly drinkable-- not unlike spiked carbonated grapefruit juice... but in a great way. Very unique. Would be an American classic if distributed more widely.","marc77","Nov 12, 2002"
4.25,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Clear orange-yellow with a thin white head.  Aroma was abounding with hops (citrus and floral).  When I first tasted the beer, all I tasted was grapefruit... I could almost detect some malt trying to sneak through and balace things out, but it couldn't quite surface.  As the beer warmed a bit, the malt became more pronounced, and balanced things out quite nicely, making this a very drinkable brew.  It has a medium body, and medium carbonation, with a slightly oily mouthfeel.  Another fine beer from Kalamazoo!","zerk","Nov 07, 2002"
4.79,12.2,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours with a great big head - three fingers.  You can smell the hops just filling the air, also smell of grapefruit.  Gold in color.  First sip reveals a taste that delivers what the aroma promises.  A nicely hopped beer but not overly so.  The hops balances well with the citrus taste.  Tastes of grapefruit rinds. This is one fresh bottle - thanks, Cloverleaf.","mjohn27603","Nov 04, 2002"
4.37,2.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I just love this beer.  Right off the bat, I could smell the hops.  I did not even know what this beer was before I ordered it, but when it was placed in front of me, I could smell the hops- they screamed at me- wonderful smell of citrus.  I knew this was an IPA.  Taste was fabulous as well, of course, hops and more hops.   Orange and slight grapefruit flavors balance this beer out- of course that it if you like the bitterness of an insanly hopped brew.  For hop heads only.","AaronRed","Oct 29, 2002"
4.52,5.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"After sucking down a few malty bocks, I figure a touch of hops would do my buds some good.  Decided on the Two Hearted and its light copper color and lacy whitish head.  The aroma told me I has chosen wisely.  The fresh burst of spicy hop punched me right in the nose and my mouth started watering.  The huge hoppy spicy hoppy flavor is sharp and exactly the right contrast to any malty brew.  The medium body helps take a bit of the edge off and brings out some of the malt to make this an extremely satisfying beer.  The knife-edge sharp bitterness finishes the experience off with a great bite.","beernut7","Oct 18, 2002"
4.1,-4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Thick, rocky off-white head, with some lace.  Copper colored beer, with haze and noticeable suspended particles.  Very noticeable fruit sweetness in the aroma, with a hint of hops.  The taste is all hops, from the start to the finish, very pleasant but without much malt.  The taste was very long lasting, with oily hops feel.  Very nice, buy it if you can get it.","jackndan","Oct 04, 2002"
4.97,16.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This beer was a cloudy orange color with some carbonation present. It formed a sudsy white head that left some nice lace(but could have been better if they had poured it right). The aroma was huge hops with malt and the usual citrus present in many Bell's beer. The flavor was of hops, malt and citrus and the finish was slightly bitter. On tap at the bar(or maybe it's this year's version)seemed a bit more citrusy than from the bottle.","Wildman","Oct 03, 2002"
4.4,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Nose of deeper citrus; more like tangerine and grapefruit. Overripe fruit. Lemongrass. Twigs. Pure and bright honey malt flavors with some exotic Asian spices. Commanding hop presence through to the long finish.","putnam","Oct 02, 2002"
5,17.1,5,5,5,5,5,"The actual review from 2002: This is one incredible IPA. The nose is that of grapefruit with a deliciously bitter hop taste. Pours out to a golden color, all its own. Its almost pastel in color. The head is large and reminds me of whipped cream. The taste excels. Yes the hops are huge, but their is malt here too. Enought to keep the big boys (the hops) from being overwhelming and giving this beer its wonderful character. The hop taste lives on long after the beer has been swallowed. The hops grab you and nearly make you beg for another sip. Once you find your palate likes hops, beers like this will hook you and your journey to all that is hop goodness will be well on its way.","proc","Oct 02, 2002"
4.92,15.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Murky caramel color with a thick white head. Sturdy retention, excellent lace. Nose is more subdued than its fresher brethren's, however the floral hops still loom underneath a seemingly smoky aroma. Less floral, earthy hops on the palate but more yeasty, toasted quality than noted in other bottles from 2002. The bottle conditioning imparts deeper, more complex flavors that hit the palate a bit differently than the younger, more assertive, and hoppier 2003 version. Of course, this stuff tasted the same as the new stuff a year ago. Pleasant, smooth mouthfeel with some subtle carbonation. Great for a year-old bottle conditioned IPA.","Jon","Aug 10, 2002"
4.5,5.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a bright clear golden with a huge rocky head and a nice sticky lace.  Smell is all hops, huge fruity/floral aromas, enough to singe the nose hairs.  Balance is the first word that comes to mind for the flavor.  Although it is not quite as evident when the brew is colder, as it warms it shows a very nice, very smooth malt character.  Just enough not to let the insane hopping drive you insane.  Piney, flowery, and citrusy hops abound and hold a party on the tongue.  Fairly dry and nicely crisp and refreshing, this is one drinkable IPA with its great balance and completely undetected alcohol content.  I was very impressed with this brew as I seem to have been with everything from this excellent brewery so far.  A hopheads dream brew.  Thanks to Deuce for the sample.","Murph","Jul 05, 2002"
4.35,1.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bronzish-copper and cloudy look with a solid head that holds. Spicy and citrusy, hoppy as sin, strong. Lovely. Bloody sin lovely. Must try IMO.","packetknife","May 25, 2002"
4.82,12.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"O!  This is some good stuff!  Two Hearted is a seriously hopped brew.  Herbal and citrusy, with a bit of a yeasty tang.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen this in bottles in the area.  If I do, this will become a standard in my beer fridge.","Viking","May 16, 2002"
4.82,12.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"There's nothing tame about this beer.  It jumps into your glass with a head that rivals most Belgians.  The dregs of the bottle swirl around the light amber liquid like the milky way through space.  You're hit with the most incredible barrage of aromas including apricots, orange rind and yeast undertones.  In you mouth, it's pretty much all about citrusy hops.  Malts?  Who needs 'em?  Finishes lemony with a spicy yeast profile establishing itself as the beer warms.  Great beer, but what's up with that label?  Thanks, proc, for the experience.","pbrian","May 14, 2002"
4.5,5.4,4,4,5,5,4,"Medium head, long lasting. Hazy amber color, upcharge of streams of medium bubbles. Straw aroma with definite marmalade smells. Hoppy, bitey flavor, more like orange rind than grapefruit. Malts slightly cut the hops, preventing a "back swallow" burn and giving a lightly syrupy, medium body. Impressive fullness. Solid beer, definitely as interesting as Kalamazoo's fleet of Stouts. A mouth "wrangler" to some degree, but not catoonish. Its rare that I get particularly excited by an American IPA but the hops on this one are outstanding without being overwhelming, juicy and straddling the line between citric and minty but retaining a fresh sense.","ADR","Apr 23, 2002"
