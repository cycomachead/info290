3.06,-24.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Hazy pale amber topped by a clingy white cap. Nose is herbal, leafy, citrus rind, touch of grain. Faintly tropical note suggests minimal usage of some new school hop probably mixed with a bunch of oldschool hops. Taste is okay - bitter citrus rind, leafy earthiness, ear wax, grapefruit. Pretty bitter and dry, slight astringent mouthfeel. Clean fermentation. Malt backbone feels somewhat substantial, but it's buried beneath a lot of bitterness. Not a great beer by any means, but nothing particularly bad about it. Can't say I'd want to drink it again.","largadeer","Wednesday at 11:29 PM"

The hops are the main showcase of its flavor profile, but some citrusy grapefruit and resiny flavors balance it nicely.  Its brewed with some malt to keep it smooth.  This is enjoyable.  Highly recommended by me.","jasonpeckins32","Mar 31, 2015"

Tatse is  initially wonderful for hop lovers - more earthy and fruity than piney, then oh-so-slightly bitter towards the end, but more vegetative with citrus and floral undetones.

Tastes of mild grapefruit pith, unripe papaya, green apple, hints at pineapple. Moderate bitterness. Flavors and bitterness fade quickly into a biscuity malt which leaves the palate clean and refreshed. Medium body holds together well without faults.

I need to get better at picking the freshest IPAs... this might be a little off due to the fact that there are obviously fresher Hop Nosh to be had. Anyways. Really nice looking brew. Solid finger of foamy, eggshell head, slightly cloudy golden amber hue. Ample carbonation throughout. Up front bitterness on the nose, and a slight hint of pine. Kind of one note aroma. Some generic hop bitterness on the front of the tongue, bit of lemony citrus, a slight yeasty estery note (seemed out of place), just a hint of the 7.3% alcohol coming through as well. Refreshing mouthfeel, with a lingering bitterness. Clean, good I guess. Might try an ultra-fresh bottle to reconsider my review, but hard to justify that this is any different from all of the other IPAs out there.","Mikus","Mar 09, 2015"

A bit of caramel too. The pinnacle of a balanced IPA. Citrus comes through on  the tongue too. Overall very well balanced, dangerously easy drinking, and a great example of and american IPA.

The hops bring a full on blast of mango, peach and a touch of white grape up front. This quickly moves on to more bitter notes of citrus rind. It seems to finish quickly but a light pine like hop bitterness creeps back in on the tongue. The palate feels fairly full and we’ll carbonated. This as well as its 7.3% abv makes for a nice slow sipping beverage.","generallee","Sep 07, 2014"

4.72,17.1,,,,,,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this IPA! It is incredibly smooth and refreshing. On the nose I get bright citrus notes of tangerine and orange peel with a lighter grassy hint to freshen it up. I love how this IPA has elements of a good wheat beer. For Instance, it's appearance is slightly cloudy with a thick foamy head which gives off very citrusy aromas. It has a very smooth and creamy taste with wonderful notes of orange, vanilla, and pine to finish it off with that fresh bite every good IPA has. In my opinion, this beer is very skillfully done and an absolute pleasure to drink.","AyeMito","Aug 22, 2014"

The flavors mesh moderately well which limits this beer's drinkability to some degree. It is a little hop-sweet in my opinion -- the honeydew melon quality is very strong and a little of it goes a long way.","argock","Jul 31, 2014"

Nice appearance, a really nice hop profile on the nose, with some citrus, floral, pine resin all mixed together nicely IMO. This beer is very under-rated and its an outstanding IPA. Very flavorful with a nice full bodied balanced mouthfeel and a citrus/pine hop balance with only moderate bitterness in finish. Definitely a go-to option for American IPA fans and hop heads as this one is easy to find and always available. I highly recommend this brew.","bubseymour","Jun 30, 2014"

This definitely tastes different from your IPA, smells different, and is a complete different experience. Very fruity taste and that is awesome, I've had in bottle and glass, glass is more flavoring and goes down a bit better while bottle is a bit stronger.

4.29,6.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"OK, I'm a big DIPA fan but let's face it - at $14 a four-pack for top-tier craft DIPAs, you may want a reasonably-priced six-pack alternative. And sometimes, you'd like the DIPA sensory indulgence but don't really need 9-10% ABV. Here's where Hop Nosh (formerly "Hop Notch") comes in. At 7.5% it's classified as a regular IPA, but on the strong - robust end of that category. However, the taste, the aroma, the complexity, the hop-forwardness; all say "DIPA." Not as big or as bold as say, a 10% Great Divide Hercules, but at 82 IBUs, there's a lot of "there" there. And what's there is delicious. My local price on Hop Nosh is $9 a six-pack - $1.50 a can compared to $3.50 a bottle for Hercules. Hoppy, yeasty, bready - this is a fabulous IPA and a pretty darned good DIPA alternative at over 50% off. It's now one of my staples.","DeanWormer","May 30, 2014"

First flavor seems to be like hay, but quickly goes to a nice hoppy, crisp, clean finish. The carbonation is just right and leaves a clean, yet flavorful finish. Also, with the hay, a touch of citrus, maybe grapefruit??. Overall, one of the best beers I have had in awhile and will definitely seek this one out a gain. Great brewer.

Its very true to the style and everything I want in a IPA. Balanced between fruity and pine hops, and sweet malts. Very fresh aroma and taste. Not too bitter and goes down smooth. The price is right also. Hands down one of my favorites in the style, and this six pack is making me wonder why I don't have this more often. I will, let me tell you.","Bone53","May 22, 2014"

I enjoyed the fruity aroma and the sweetness but wish the fruit was more apparent in the taste, which was more floral and piney. I know with IPAs the fruity flavors are the first to go so hopefully a fresher bottle would be more fruity.","PaulyB83","Mar 03, 2014"

Piney hoppy bitterness upfront when tasting. There is a hint of citrus at the end, but the grassy hops persist throughout. The bitter aftertaste is not too strong and not too weak. Just right. There is a slight malty character in the middle, but it is not a major part of the beer. Even, though, this is an excellent IPA.

Aromas of citrus and pine with some faint green onions and a solid hit of bready caramel malt to back it up. The flavor is actually quite malt forward with lots of sweet bread and rich caramel and toffee notes. Pine, resin, and a bit of green onion flavor provides a bit of balance. Firm hop bitterness. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy and resinous mouthfeel. My can shows a best before 1/25/14 I'm not sure when that means it was bottled, but I found this a bit malty for an IPA. Decent enough and drinkable, but I'd grab something else before this again.","johnnnniee","Jan 05, 2014"

4.24,5.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a nice clear amber with a half finger white head that receded to a ring of white and left nice lacing down the glass. It's a good looking American IPA, entirely true to style. Scents of citrus, mostly grapefruit and some pineapple, grassy hops, a bit of floral hops a very faint hint of pine and a bit of caramel malt sweetness. It's a good, standard West Coast IPA scent, very on style for an American IPA. Taste begins with piney hops, some floral hops sustained throughout, moving into some grapefruit pith on the middle of the sip. A nice caramel malt sweentess also balances the bitter hops in the background throughout the sip. Aftertaste is bitter with slight floral notes. As the beer warms the hop profile becomes dominated by grapefruit with slight floral notes. The flavor is like the aroma, very true to style, well crafted and hoppy, a good West Coast American IPA flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a bit drying a finish with a slight alcohol burn. Quite nice, true to style, with maybe a bit more alcohol burn than most American IPAs. Overall this is a very good American IPA, it fits the style perfectly and is just a nice good American IPA. Given it's price this will probably become my go-to IPA.","Auraan","Oct 26, 2013"

A nice hop bitterness, with grapefruit up front and on the way down, with a definite lingering pine on the palate. Hop bite all the way through. Carbonation is lower than I expected.

The cap is an inch of white foam with decent retention and OK clinging ability. Smell is what you would expect, hopped up nicely with a big malty background. I can smell the alcohol pretty clearly. Some tropical fruit scent coming off and a bready malt bill. Taste is a very hop forward ale with a sweet side to it. The malts come first and than some alcohol, reminding me of some East coast DIPA'S. After that the hops form a bitter seal on the tounge and cling for a good amount. A grassy aftertaste is left and the alcohol stays. feel is right dead center medium and a bit syrupy. Easy drinking beer but a bit rough around the edges.","BARFLYB","Aug 11, 2013"

There's enough to like here and almost makes it stand above the crowd, but that's only because of how many good competitors are out there. This is worthy nevertheless and worth a try for any hophead that loves a beer that's tasty and well-balance. Easily the best offering Uinta currently on the shelf.","JerzDevl2000","Aug 06, 2013"

The immediate taste is refreshing, hard to describe, but a grassy finish helps compliments the IPA immediate taste, but the aftertaste is still fairly bitter. I am usually extremely against IPA's but this is probably one I could manage with in this category, be it the pine and grass hint, or strong hops? unsure. Probably would not try again but would recommend if you enjoy IPA's. The best IPA for me but IPA is my least favorite style.","json83","Jul 19, 2013"

Smells of light grapefruit, some pine, some grass, oranges, a resinous quality to it, some light bready notes as well as some carmel sweetness. Taste is pretty much like the smell. It starts with grapefruit, oranges, and lemon. Then the malt comes in and balances the beer fairly well. Lots of sweet breadiness. Then the hops of the more bitter variety come back. Lots of resinous pine, as well as some grapefruit and oranges. Nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel to accompany the resinous hops. Medium body. The bitterness lingers after each sip.

Nose is grapefruit, pine and grass. A great big whiff of bread but then the malt disappears for a minute behind some herbal and grassy dank. Malt presence in the nose is ultimately very soft, sweet caramel and cookie. Taste is delightful with ample malts, lots of oily piney hops, a little bit of sour grapefruit. This beer was like silk on the palate. Some said watery and I disagree. The malt was cultivated to perfection underneath the hops bitter and leaned into the dry finish with a sweetness on the back that was supple and full. Bitterness fades fast in the aftertaste as this one leaves smooth and the definition of dry. Hop Notch is top notch.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The hop profile is not particularly complex, and the malt is clean, but deep tasting at the same time with lingering flavors of what I would call peach at the finish. The mouthfeel is utterly smooth and almost creamy. The ABV is pretty high, but you could never tell through taste. At $6.49 a six pack, I think I found my new favorite beer. Thank god it's not a seasonal. Now it comes in cans! I can't wait to try it.","LordChesterfield","Jun 05, 2013"

I've already drank half of the six pack and I'm really enjoying it so far, pours a brilliant copper color with slightly off white billowing head, leaves fine speckled lacing. Aroma big dank earthy citrus and a bit of the fine mary jane like resinous cannabis, light biscuit caramel malt backbone just barely present. Flavor upfront big juicy hops, pine, citrus, earthiness resinous flowing notes with a hint of malt in the backend, finishes semi dry I like the hops in this bottle. I will call it an almost west coast IPA, pretty damn good. Incredibly easy to guzzle, the hops don't linger with razor sharp bitterness yet have complex hop notes all day, I really dig the vibe I'm getting here. Resinous medium bodied hop oils glide well across my palate with sturdy carbonation, classic IPA.","WVbeergeek","May 28, 2013"

Nose was of resinous piney hops and having come from a high school no-hitter this afternoon, it reminded me of pine tar. Wow! Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were notched up to the point of unmistakability. I now wonder where the demarcation line between an AIPA and a DIPA actually lies. It is somewhere around this brew. Great lacing began to form in my glass as I drank. Finish was actually only semi-dry, which is surprising, given the level of IBUs that this must register. If this measures up from a CAN, my cooler may have a new friend.","woodychandler","May 24, 2013"

Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, tangerine, pine resin, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange rind, pine resin, floral, light caramel, bread, grass, and floral earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine resin, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice flavor balance of pine/citrus hops with a light-moderate malt balance; and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, very sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

There's a beautiful caramel-pine and nutty oak aroma. The taste is intense pine hop softened by caramel-toffee sweetness and orange citrus bite. There's some herbal leafy ideas tossed in. I would say it's a bit cloying with a medium-plus body and somewhat syrupy in feel. The carbonation is gentle but does the job to cut through reasonably. Not bad at all, arguably a mighty big IPA.","Durge","Mar 24, 2013"

Mouth-watering hoppy smells of fresh-cut grass and piney woods with a hint of citrus and light malt. Intense flavors of dank, grassy hops that approaches an oniony or garlicy character, but falls just short of that.

Medium on nearly full bodied with fine, moderated carb and a watery finish. Nice beer.

When I really get my nose in there there's strong floral piney hops, a very pronounced malt presence, and a hint of alcohol. A bit malty and weak on the citrus, but still a good smelling beer. Taste is, as expected, strong hops with a solid malt backbone. More citrusy notes come through on the taste with a touch of alcohol. Feel is crisp and medium bodied. Very bitter and easy to drink.

This IPA is a pleasing golden orange/amber color with a thin, lacy head and a fair to substantial amount of effervesence. It's fragrance is the most appealing quality and really knocked out of the park a blend of sweet caramel notes and lemony citrus hops, in tandem with elements of pineapple. It's light bodied for an IPA and tastes of white grapefruit and spruce, and it's unfortunately not as bold (nor does it have a lingering viscosity) as I'd prefer. There's also an acidic quality that that detracts from the overall mouthfeel, but all in all, this is a quality west coast IPA.","ALBuff","Feb 12, 2013"

Pours a light copper hue with a translucent clarity and a fizzy, 1.5 inch off-white head. Head eventually settles into a thin, consistent, soapy skim with strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. The nose on this exudes fresh, aromatic hops - grapefruit, piney notes, tropical fruit and a suggestion of Simcoe (yep - I get a little cat pee). Taste is a bit less fruity than suggested by the nose, but there's still some grapefruit characteristics as well as a light, earthy bitterness towards the back. Finish comes off as slightly watery. All this on a balanced, malty backbone. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation that falls just short of lively, a slightly oily texture and a light alcohol bite at the finish. Overall, a fairly well-balanced IPA with a well-hidden abv. Pretty decent IPA overall, but I anticipated a little bit more based on the nose.","Jwale73","Feb 01, 2013"

3.81,-5.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured from my home tap with a a bright yellow-orange color and a thick, foamy head, this beer has an aroma of light citrus and woodsy hops combined with a likewise light bready malt character. The flavor is more pronounced, with a bitingly bitter combination of dull grapefruit rind and grass, although there is also a mild malty presence to provide some semblance of balance. The mouthfeel is resinous and substantial, enhancing the bold, bitter flavor. Overall, this is a solid, bright IPA that impresses but doesn't stand out.","devilben02","Jun 27, 2012"

Smell is citrusy grapefruit. Love the smell. Taste is smooth. Not as hop forward as I thought it was going to be from the smell. Pretty nicely balanced. The hoppier the better for me usually but this is a nice balanced easy drinking brew from Uinta. First beer ever from Utah and I am very pleased with it. High quality for a lower price.

Aromas of wet, resiny, citrus hops with a subtle toffee backbone. Flavors are hop forward and rich, with a clinging resin and bitter character. Toffee backbone remains light, but strong enough to balance the strong hops profile. Very well blended and smooth, the beer has a slightly bitter, resiny aftertaste. Solid body, with a layered lacing on the glass as you drink. The finish is smooth and clean, with a touch of bitterness to give a slight drying feel. Very solid IPA.","GarthDanielson","Jun 19, 2012"

Maybe it's because it's a couple of months old, but I'm not that hardcore about getting my ipa's straight off the bottling line.

Juicy, oily hop flavor. Grapefruit and orange with some trailing pine in the back and a tropical flair. Something unfortunately comes across as metallic tasting, but I don't recall that in previous experiences. Medium bodied and appropriately bitter.

Good balanced flavor and goes down very easily for a 7.3% ABV. The bottle and label are also cool and they claim it is brewed with wind and solar renewable power.

Not as much citrus on the nose as I expected, although it is there, but accompanied by some vegetal notes, some herbal character, pineapple, and a subtle onion and garlic quality. The taste is more straightforward than the nose, but also has some complexity to it. A good amount of tropical fruit flavors balanced by some soft malt flavors a touch of pine and a mild medium bitterness.

A pleasing citrus rind bitterness and resin character is present on the finish, coating the palate and reducing the sweetness. Moderately peachy as well, especially as I keep drinking it, and as it warms up. While decent, the sweetness does get to be a bit much after a while. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this is quite pleasant on the palate with great flavors, but unfortunately, it's not quite my kind of IPA.

Playfully scented nose of hothouse flowers, pine sap, pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus and an erect spine of herbal hops and pepper, the apricot, peach, pineapple fruit more muted, in the end more sweet than bitter but not lacking in the latter, quietly worms its way into your nostrils like it owns the deed. Medium-bodied, places the bitterness and leafy hoppiness upfront for an initial puckering effect, then allows the general creamy mouth texture to take over, orange pekoe tea, licorice, pine, sourdough bread segue to fuller pineapple, mango, peach, apricot fruit. Pink and white grapefruit, tangerine, mandarin orange, citrus soup in your mouth. Carbonation has a keen prickle to it but neither broad nor especially long lived. Very clean finish, refreshing and tingly. Could drink a lot of these ice cold.","farrago","Jan 02, 2012"

4.35,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hoppy and tasty, this really is a "top notch" IPA. Nice big dose of bitter, almost resinous, grapefruit hops. High in alpha acids and the bitterness lingers throughout the taste. Touch of alcohol in the finish, but doesn't distract from some really nice fruity and hoppy flavors. Orange is definitely in the front briefly, only to be dismantled by the onslaught of resiny grapefruit hops. It makes a small comeback on the backside of the taste, just enough to balance everything out. A decent little bready malt bill works its way into the balance as well. Manages to be just as hoppy as a DIPA, but doesn't ever cross the line in its extremeness, making this a very drinkable brew. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and moderately carbonated, almost creamy with a craveable lingering bitterness. If you need an alpha acid fix but don't want to be completely floored by a higher ABV DIPA, this one is your beer. Very enjoyable, and my first from Uinta. Not the last either.","chodinheaven","Oct 19, 2011"
