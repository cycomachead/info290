Smells like a hops cookie.  Taste is similar - it has a lot of sweetness that balances the earthy hop flavors.  Finish is mildly bitter.  Body is lighter than I expected with ample carbonation.  Overall, it's very drinkable, but being a hop-head it's a little on the sweet side for my tastes.","mr-jj","Mar 24, 2015"

Flavor is caramel sweetness and some grapefruit flesh and peel, bread, and pine hop resin. I expected a more pronounced hop profile based on other reviews. I’ll chalk it up to the fact that this beer was bottled in September and I drank it in February. Medium body, slick but resinous texture, average carbonation, long bitter finish. I’ll try a fresher one and see if it helps.","SierraFlight","Feb 24, 2015"

There are not many times that there are legitimately great looking beers too, but this beer looks great in a glass. Brilliant reddish amber, perfectly translucent, with turbid effervescing bubbles. A crown of pillow like head sites atop. Very appealing and appetizing. Smell is sweet hops, honey and pineapple. Rate is extremely well balanced, hops forward with a sweet and earthy finish.

4.3,3.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/29/2014. Pours slightly hazy orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/floral hops and light-moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pineapple, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and light-moderate malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around outstanding complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and light-moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 12, 2014"

No head as such after beer settles. Nice balanced taste and not too bitter or sweet. In my brain I'm probably comparing this to Sierra Nevada Torpedo and all in all a very nice beer at a nice price and nice easy drinker (maybe too easy).

The reason I say this is because I tend to prefer an intense hop aroma and taste in my IPAs. However, this beer has exposed me to examples of IPA in which the hops is not so powerful and more subtle. I would also like to add that I'm currently drinking this one without food and after a hard day at work; the result is a beautiful buzz that is making me forget all the nonsense I had to put up with today. Thanks Centennial IPA! :)","Gajo74","Nov 03, 2014"

4.5,8.7,,,,,,"Poured into a pint glass, it has a nice one finger head which settles into a lasting cap.  Leaves a lacy ring around the glass after each sip.  Beautiful copper orange with a hint of peach color.  Smells delicious; slightly floral but not offensively so.  Hints of citrus. Love the smell of centennial hops.   Slight sweetness which is balanced out with a nice malt and hint of tartness. One of my top ten IPAs. Excellent goto beer.  Been with us at the cabin several times and I never get tired of it.  Have yet to be disappointed with a Founder's beer.","BeerSnobRobinson","Oct 02, 2014"

Very floral grassy and slight citrus taste.  Medium body with medium carbonation.  Fantastic beer!","drdiesel9483","Sep 17, 2014"

Crisp and sharp with an intense blast of citrusy hops, this is one of the finest IPAs I have tried in my 8-or-so years on this site - easily outclassing many Ontario staples. Great stuff, I'm sure I'll be buying this one in larger quantities in the future. Well worth a look if you can find fresh bottles.","thehyperduck","Jul 15, 2014"

4.39,6,4,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.25,"12 oz bottle into willy glass. This is a really good IPA. The color is clear yellowish amber with an adequate slowly-fading off-white head. The aroma is nicely fruity and floral mixed with some bready malt. Taste is really good - seems quite complex for a single hop. I must really like Centennial. It seem like the ideal hop flavor mixed nicely with caramel notes in this beer. Mouth feel is especially nice ...just the right balance of sweet malt body and carbonation. Overall, a surprisingly good IPA at a decent price point.","FFreak","Jun 30, 2014"

This, in my opinion, is the best beer ever made. The taste is piney, bitter, floral, resin, and oily. Complex yet simple. The smell is piney and floral. Large head on tap pour that last forever. Lots of lacing. HUGE taste. Most of my friends did not like it. They are lager bud light types. If you don't like this beer, it's not the beer it's the style, you won't like any IPA's. They are not for everyone. The beer snobs however will testify that this is one of the benchmarks that is easily obtainable. Excellent beer!","DarrellK66","Jun 10, 2014"

There's a substantial malt component, nice and sweet, though there's also a big balancing bitterness and, of course, a load of hop flavor.

The hops are the star and are FRESH but it allows the malty sweetness to come out and play. Truly a joy to drink. for an added treat, let it warm for 10 minutes and then you'll get more of the malt coming through. My guess is a nice pale ale malt with a medium crystal.

The hops bring solid bitterness and floral orange blossom and citrus to the mix. I also pick up a candy like fruity sweetness pooping in and out. It finishes slowly with a more herbal like hop bitterness.","generallee","May 27, 2014"

It has a very nice aroma that consists of grapefruit and some other types of citrus fruit. The taste is very pleasant on my tongue and you can definitely taste the hops, as well as the citrus notes. It does have a bit of an aftertaste, but it's a pleasant aftertaste. I'd definitely recommend it.","FeistyRodent","May 24, 2014"

4.41,6.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a gorgeous clear amber with a one-finger white head that receded to a quarter finger of head that left some sticky lacing. A very nice, true to style IPA appearance. Scents of orange, sweet, honey-like malt and some subdued grassy and floral hop aromas that dissipate as the beer sits. The orange and malt aromas stay throughout and grow in intensity. A very nice, simple, appealing aroma that entices you to drink. Flavor begins with a modest level of hop bitterness, with notes of pine resin, citrus zest and floral hops, and a nice, sweet, caramel malt backbone. This moves into a more pronounced hop flavor, with more citrus zest and pine resin, but still with a nice malt backbone. The finish is dry and brings in pepper-like flavors, alongside some pine resin and floral and earthy hops with a lighter, though still present, caramel. Aftertaste is toasted grain, pepper, pine resin and floral hops. A very nice flavor profile, balanced yet still packed with hop flavor. The combination of just enough malt and just enough hops makes it a near perfectly balanced, extremely drinkable package. Excellent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, silky, slightly resinous and chewy with a light level of carbonation. Very nice, quite easy to drink and very smooth. Very well done. Overall this is an excellent IPA that combines an excellent balance of flavors with a wonderful mouthfeel. The aroma is the weakest aspect of this beer, yet even that is above average. A truly excellent example of an IPA.","Auraan","Apr 26, 2014"

It strikes the perfect balance between hop bitterness and malty sweetness, and is absurdly drinkable because of this. This is tasting amazing coming from the can.","ryan1788a5","Apr 16, 2014"

Nice light amber color. The aromas were excellent (4.5/5 for me!)... pine, grapefruit, some elusive floral hints, goodness... I smelled this beauty when I cracked the can (so glad there is another in the fridge!). Taste was also spot on. There was the nice floral hit (kind of new to me in IPAs), nice even bitterness, and not malty, or heavy... nice and refreshing (even at 7.2). Really nice balance of flavor all around. The finish was clean and crisp, and it was relatively light on the palate. Overall, what can I say... it is a winner. Hope these cans become more readily available in Western PA. This would be a fridge stocker for me.","Mikus","Apr 05, 2014"

4.42,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Another review on-tap: A fingers' worth of deep-tan/light brown head upon arrival. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a faint citrus grapefruit quality, but not overwhelmingly so I assumed that this was a varietal, using Centennial hops, as opposed to any of the other five (5) C's-Columbus, Chinook, Cascade, and xxx. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild citrus hoppiness on the tongue. Finish was dry, even a bit musty. Danny postulated that it might be sessionable, but I'll reserve judgement until I know its ABV. Still, a good eye-opener at 1100 on a Sunday.","woodychandler","Feb 08, 2014"

As I'm drinking this it's leaving rings on the pint glass. More on the citrus side for the aroma as opposed to pine. Too much of a lingering after taste on this one. As far as IPAs go ones with a clean finish are the best. I'm going to opposite direction of the crowd on this one although they make a killer breakfast stout and porter. On the east coast for this genre of beer there's a lot better out there.","Ryanm1","Jan 12, 2014"

Sips well, very smooth for an unfiltered ale. Not particularly hoppy more malty than most ipas. Definitely has a bit of an alcohol bite but is very well balanced.

Aroma has a hint of sour with a light floral/citrus hop undertone and a caramel malt presence. Tasting revealed a well balance brew with moderate bitterness. I know it's called Centennial but I'm thinking I taste some Cascade maybe as a bittering addition. On the front end the maltiness comes through quickly moving to a grassy hoppiness. There is a citrusy rise and finishes with a dry, lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue. Excellent example of an AIPA and while a bit bigger than their All-Day IPA, Founders has created one of the best Pale Ale series in the market.","Hoperator","Dec 12, 2013"

The mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but otherwise considering the strength it is quite quaffable. The flavor has a trace of orange that blends fairly well with the citrus hops. I think the flavor of this hop is not a personal favorite, but I'll take it over Nelson Sauvin hops any day.","Franziskaner","Nov 09, 2013"

The piney fresh hops cascade throughout my mouth, and then just when I think a malt-based letdown would suddenly cut-off the hop nirvana, it creeps through again, steady and flavorful! I see how well-balanced this accomplished brew is. What stands out about the hops are how fresh they taste. Tropical/ orange. Nothing is too much here. Bitter in the end, but right. Medium carbonation, smooth. Definitely tasty, worthy.","TBoneJones","Oct 22, 2013"

Years ago I couldn't believe how hoppy this seemed. Now with all the hop bombs out there this seems truly mild. This is an IPA for those who like their malt. The mouthfeel may be its best quality: a light carbonation with a slightly oily texture. Goes down well.","Qbdoo","Aug 31, 2013"

From pour to drinking you will smell hops, but you will not feel that the beer is all hops thanks to the malt. The hop character is not super piney, so you can really get into the complexity of the beer. I am glad to see it in our area.","jbone78","Aug 30, 2013"

Slightly cloudy amber/orange with a thinner white head that sticks around and leaves nice lacing. Smell is attenuated fruity/herbal hops with hefty crackery malts behind it. Taste is a glorious mix of spicy, herbal and fruity hops with crackery malt with some sweetness. Very complex, alcohol is a little noticeable but it is a stronger IPA.

4.13,-0.2,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Bright coppery orange in the glass with a one finger off white head of tiny bubbles that throw a lot of lace during the session. This is all IPA in the nose, the hop aromas are almost sticky. The hops here run the full gamut from citrus to floral and herbal and everything in between. In the taste the hops of course are the focus. The citrus flavors dominate with a plenty of bitterness in there as well. There is still a considerable malt base in this beer, enough to balance the hops keeping it from running away and becoming difficult to drink. Speaking of which this is a very nice drinking IPA. The finish is just a touch sweet with a long lasting bitterness that sits on the tongue until you take the next sip. Overall a very good IPA good for a session but complex enough to drink slow and enjoy.","fank2788","Jun 28, 2013"

It also seemed to have a temperature threshold once it warmed a bit where it really came alive before mellowing back down with further warming. A nice IPA for groups, enough bite for the hopheads out there ripping your head off.","Maninthearena","Jun 12, 2013"

Definitely a lot more like a East Coast IPA in terms of delivering a lot of earthy, malty syrup, but it's dank and fruity enough on the hoppy side to hold interest the whole way through. I could definitely have a bunch of these in a row, just like SN Torpedo. Hope I can try this fresher one day, as I'd imagine the pine would really jump out then.

Nice bitter hop flavor with fruit and citrus with more caramel in the background and a grapefruit peel finish. The beer is medium bodied with velvety carbonation and a smooth finish.

Smell is all out citrus and tropical fruits up front, grapefruit being the most upfront, a bit of sweet bready malt, as it warms more citrus fruit in the way of orange, pineapple and mango. Taste is fruity, lots of bitter hops, lots of citrus fruit mostly grapefruit and orange, a bit of sweet malt mid palate, drying finish with long hoppy pineapple finish. Light-medium dry cabonation, medium body. I really enjoyed this, basically my ideal IPA here, something I would gladly drink a lot more of.","peensteen","Mar 23, 2013"

It also had a touch of sourness to it and the carbonation didn't seem quite right. Not a bad beer at all, but I was disappointed, given what I'd read in other reviews. To be fair, this had been bottled 2 months ago. I'd like to try it again fresh and will re-review if I do. Overall, a decent ipa, but nothing to get excited about.","dougfur","Mar 04, 2013"

The taste is just ok. I really want to like this cause I'm a huge Founders fan, but ultimately I need to be honest with myself and admit that this is a mid level IPA. There are many out there that are a bit smoother and have a nicer hoppy presence. This offering tend to leave a bitter aftertaste that keeps building. I've tried this on many different occasions and its always the same ending. Not a bad beer by any mean, but if I'm reaching for an IPA, I'm looking else where in this case.","sjones5045","Jan 01, 2013"

Finally, the more I think about this beer - each of its parts is just good, but combined, it's quite impressive and is more than the sum of its parts.

At a perfectly tamed and masked 7.2% ABV, it remains so drinkable, also partially due to the wonderful checks-and-balances in flavors. I love this beer. The one major drawback, is that the beer must be very fresh. After 8 weeks from the bottling date, the hops really start to fade and the malt becomes overpowering. This is true for most IPAs, but I feel like it's more prominent in this one. It really shines when it's super fresh.","tectactoe","Oct 18, 2012"

3.87,-6.5,4.5,5,3,4,4,"This poured with a single fingers head that was gone in seconds. It has a nice orange like copper coloring that is almost bright. The scent of this IPA is perhaps the nicest I have ever smelled. You can catch the floral, fruity, hoppy notes but it smelled like a lemon iced tea to me. Perhaps that is why I rate the taste lower is the anticipation. It fell rather flat as I got subtle hints of hops and citrus but it was rather unremarkable. I kept taking sip after sip waiting for it to live up to the scent and it never did.","KYGunner","Oct 13, 2012"

4.15,0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Nitro growler courtesy of the Beer Boutique on Brooklyn. Superb brew! This one is beautifully clear with with a thick head that is leaving a lot of lace on the glass.. Color is perfect is with a lot of darkness to the overall orange hue. head is light bone white and creamy. Nice sweet smell has caramel in abundance with a yeasty bread base that serves up the pine forrest of hops that color the nose. Taste follows with chunks of warm bread and toasted graininess. A dry citrus hops cuts in and stops the malt party. Hop oil lingers and seems to drip from the sides of my mouth and edges of my tongue. A light sweetness underpins the finish that brings full force to the multilayered hop bouquet. Grapefruit and pine, it runs the gamut. Feel is dry and crisp with a stickiness to a medium weight body. Carbonation is quite cask like with a mild effervescence that gives a silky, easy, drinkability. A delicious and desirable beer that makes itself a top pick in this category.","scootny","Oct 07, 2012"

Like other similar beers of the same origin, it finds strength in a well-positioned malt profile.

Smells of floral, resinous and citrusy hops with a solid bready and caramel malt backbone. The flavor is crisp bitter and caramel. There's a solid hit of hops in the form of resin and citrus up front followed by lots of bready malt and a hint of caramel. The finish is a long lingering resiny bite. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice IPA, maybe a hint on the sweet side but great nonetheless. Thanks for coming to NH!","johnnnniee","Aug 01, 2012"

Taste is initially crisp and malty, followed by a wave of carbonation, finishing with a bracing hoppy astringency. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. It is nicely carbonated and there is just a little warming sweetness from the alcohol. Overall, a very good beer. The hops are bitter and crisp, without much in the way of floral or piney notes. It's not the most interesting or rich hop profile in my opinion, but this is a very, very good straight-ahead IPA.","DoreenAndDave","Jul 29, 2012"

Big hops all over this thing, pungent floral hops strike the nose followed by grassy hop notes an touch of pine, a bit of a peppery feel found in the smell as well. Floral,and fruity hops with a bitter bite on the tongue, so very flowery and peppery. Medium bodied, light carbonation, leaves the mouth very dry and bitter. For only being 65 ibu's this has got a pretty strong bitter punch. This is a fucking great AIPA, the hops are so juicy and floral, very easy drinking for the alcohol content as well.","gabedivision","Jul 10, 2012"

It has the strong, flavorful hoppiness going on in parallel to a solid malt backbone while still achieving a great dry, bitter finish. It may not be the hottest IPA on the market, but it's always welcome in my fridge. Another go-to beer by Founders that also isn't too expensive at all. Two thumbs way up.","hagbergl","Jun 04, 2012"

Some definite malt scent, but more hoppy, with a variety of choices - some citrus, but more floral, with a little pine for good measure. Taste us excellent for the style. Good balance, but obviously for the style, the hops shine. I'd say the piney hops come through the clearest, but there's a complex mix there.

I poured this beer before it was ice cold which really helped to bring out the citrusy hops and sweetness. The taste is crisp and delightfully hoppy with mouthwatering citrus, candy sweetness, and a dry finish. Overall this beer is an outstanding IPA with potent hops and a lingering sweetness.

Another new brew I hadn't heard of poured to pint glass the beer is a slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1.5 finger white cap, good retention and lacing. The nose is a terrific blend of peach, grapefruit fruit with a kiss if earthy pine from the centennial hops. Great. The flavor is very much the same with an initial surge of the peach flavor with a more subtle grapefruit and pine from the hops along with a medium bitterness. A nice toasted malt base provides a nice balance. Finishes with a delightful mild bitterness and peach flavor that lingers for a while. Medium bodied and adequately carbonated.

Aromas of rich and resiny hops with a mild floral highlight balance with strong caramel malt and citrus sweet notes. Smells great. Flavors are hop forward, with a bitter and resiny blast on the forward tongue, followed quickly with a rich toffee and caramel backbone that helps to balance and also spotlight the hops profiles. Tangy, bitter, and rich, the palate gets a quick jolt of tart grapefruit throughout, also. Rich, bitter, and hoppy aftertaste leading into a slick, dry, and clean finish. This is a damn good beer.","GarthDanielson","Apr 24, 2012"

4.35,5.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12oz bottle, pours a hazy deep orange/amber with a nice fluffy head that dissipates into a foam atop the ale, but leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are dank hops, with hints of pine along with a healthy dose of caramel malt. Tastes are bitter yet balanced. Piny hops dominate, but the caramel malt, grapefruity, peppery/spicy hops create a balanced and complex IPA. Mouth-feel is full bodied and rather oily, allowing the hop bitterness to linger on the palate. Overall, I'm a sucker for centennial hops, and this is always a favorite IPA of mine.","barnzy78","Apr 09, 2012"

I find myself coming back to the word balance when I think about this beer. It doesn't have a single part that sticks way out but everything blends well together. After having many beers that leave a lasting impression based on one or two things (super hoppy, really malty, fruity, bitter, etc.) it's possible at times that a beer with no spikes in its profile can seem less remarkable. Centennial doesn't seem to have any spikes but then I get to the end, pick out the ratings and conclude that the whole beer is pretty damn good. The spike is found in the bigger picture and overall excellence.","jujigatame","Feb 26, 2012"

Pours a translucent amber with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head that eventually dissipates into a creamy skim. Thin strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is subdued - a suggestion of caramel malt, a little earthy bitterness and a hint of citrus. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are a bit too malt-centric and somewhat overshadows the hop character which really only peaks out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a slightly oily consistency. All and all, a simple IPA somewhat lacking any distinctive character. ABV is very well-hidden, but this beer doesn't really warrant the price in my opinion.","Jwale73","Jan 15, 2012"

There’s a light hop aroma of straw/hay—not barnyard funk, mind you—but nothing overpowering. Taste bitter but easy going, with a spicy undertone to a solid hop flavor profile. I’m struggling to find the right descriptor as it’s not dominated by pine, nor citrus. But it is enjoyable!","elNopalero","Jan 02, 2012"

4.34,4.8,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep amber with 1 finger of sticky head that reduces to a thin layer that persists. Aroma is strongly citrus. Lots of grapefruit with a sweet floral/tangerine undertone, almost like the sweet scent of flowers on a citrus tree (my parents use to have a lime tree and this beer smells like when that tree was in bloom). As I continue to let the beer open up I get a touch of alcohol on the nose but nothing overpowering. Taste is strong but not overpoweringly bitter. The hops are still there but aren't as present as on the nose. The citrus is balanced with a touch of malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is clean with active carbonation. Overall, this is a really nice IPA, I only noticed halfway through drinking it that it is almost 8 month old so I would be interested to try it fresh but it must have been well taken care of because the hop aroma and flavor was still very pronounced.","quirkzoo","Oct 23, 2011"

The bitterness and mouthfeel are spot-on, and the hop character is comforting in its lack of extremes. The beer develops nicely as you finish the glass, the hops building on each other on the tongue for a deeper flavor.","paperbackfoster","Oct 20, 2011"

4.23,2.2,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"O: The beer is not over the top which is probably why I appreciate it so much!

The taste is fresh and citrusy, but the hoppiness in the finish is too muted to suit my taste. This beer presents a conundrum: can an IPA with a less than powerful hop profile be considered truly great? I'll cop out and say that this is borderline great with tremendous flavor, but it leaves those of us who are intense hop-heads wanting for some extra bitterness.","57md","Sep 28, 2011"

Taste is bitter, with the hops dominating the forefront of the taste, but finishes with a delicious toasted malt character reminiscent of an amber. Also noticeable is some faint orange, caramel, and some herbal notes. The caramel really shines through as it warms, though the ever present hops round it out very nicely. Mouth begins with hoppy, bitter punch, smooths out in the middle as it takes on a caramely, creamy texture, and it finishes slightly dry. Overall, a very interesting and delicious brew that I'm glad to have tried! I would surely welcome this one again in the future.","eclipse54","Aug 18, 2011"
4.3,3.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Centennial IPA pours out as a hazy, orange into amber colored brew, frothy cream colored head, sheets of lacing. The scent will key you into the fact that this is an IPA that's all about the hops. Grapefruit and citrus hops, fruity. Very enticing scent. Damn, the flavor is big for a beer this size. There is a slight caramel malt start, but that is decimated by the hops. We're talking citrus, lemon, grapefruit, oily, bitter, resinous hops. The malts emerge more as your mouth acclimated to the brew, and they are well blended. You can notice the alcohol a bit if you're looking for it, but that is also very well blended. Medium bodied.","Tballz420","Aug 17, 2011"

Flavor is much more mellow than I expected. Somewhat herbal. Not sweet, but not horribly bitter. It’s a mellow, flavorful bitterness as opposed to an abrasive resiny bitterness.

Big time beta acid presence from the dry hopping. Pretty light-bodied for an IPA and very easy to drink. 7.2% is well hidden. Very nice.","DustinPowers74","Jul 09, 2011"

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D - The hop character in this beer is undeniable, but there is really quite a strong malt backbone that never loosens its grip on your palate. The hop character is that of a fairly standard IPA with lots of pine and citrus and less tropical fruit than I might have expected. It is an enjoyable beer, but the malt is just a bit too dark and thick for my taste and it bogs down the hop character and keeps it from shining through the way that it might under other circumstances.","nickfl","Jun 17, 2011"

4.45,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Color is copper, like a dark apple juice, with a thick white head that lasts through the whole glass and creates a nice lacing. The pleasing scents are a variety of citrus - peach, pear, and a little grapefruit. Grapefruit is prominent in the taste. There's a slight fruity sweetness in front, followed by a surge of bitter grapefruit and pine taste in the finish. Very delicious. Definitely an IPA I'd choose again.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jun 15, 2011"
3.9,-5.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"No date on beer, but I think the store moves these quickly. Pours out a copper color with frothy head. Smell is of resinous hops, pine and some faint toasted hops. Nice lacing. The taste of the beer is some oily hops, grapefruit, but more pine, and a touch of some lemony citrus in there. Also, the malts are robust enough to make this beer pretty balanced and it has a nice caramel backbone to reel in some of those hops, but the overall aftertaste is a nice puckering, drying hop flavor with some faint herbal characteristics. The mouthfeel is very very smooth and I have found this beer to be highly drinkable. My only gripe is that I do find the hops *slightly* muted for an IPA with 65 IbU's. Which can only lead me to believe this beer might be a bit older than I'd like, who knows with no decipherable date code.","Star80","Jun 14, 2011"

This one was missing that fruit taste as it went down so I finished it thinking it was missing something.

They complement each other...thats the phrase I was looking for.

There is a sharp, peppery, herbal aroma with the tell-tale grapefruit citrus of delicious centennial hops thrumming just under the surface. Ahhh, just as good as I want to remember it being- a medium body of balanced malt that is enrobed in sharp, grassy, piney bitterness that culminates in a bountiful mouthful of grapefruit rind, cilantro, mild peppercorns and a supportive clover honey sweetness.

3.38,-18.4,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Centennial IPA pours a crystal clear amber-to-orange, depending on how well lit it is. There's a little bit of white foam topping the beer, and it sticks around for a quick minute before leaving a solid amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is surprisingly sweet, but once I get past that the requesite grapefruit citrusy aromas shine through. There's big caramel up front with each sip, despite being brewed in Michigan this beer's get both feet planted on the east coast side of the US IPA map. From there a brief interlude of bitterness leads to the citrusy close. This part tastes a bit off to me though, it's a very harsh grapefruit flavor. It's what I'd imagine would happen if someone wasn't paying attention and zested a bunch of the pith in with the grapefruit skin while cooking. Unsurprisingly, the body is more to the full side for the style, not nearly as bone dry as some of its west coast counterparts. The carbonation admirably cuts through that to let the hop flavors pop. I don't know if it's the particular hop combination/schedule that Founder's uses or what, but the hop profile just rubs me the wrong way. Probably not an IPA I'd reach for again if others were available.","axeman9182","May 26, 2011"

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a one finger bone white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and subtle pine. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice IPA. The flavors on this one were quite well balanced. The aroma was very nice too and kept you coming back for more. The citrus was very forward on this one, but very enjoyable.

The malt bill is really what makes it shine. Who knows maybe they made the malt sweet and candy like because of only having one hop variety in there. Whatever they do they do it good and this beer is on the top of the list when it comes to IPA's.","thebrood1987","Apr 27, 2011"

I've really enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to be had with something very hearty and with sharp flavours that can compete with the bitterness and the alcohol flavour. The alcohol flavour is actually quite the deterrent to me, I can't really stand the alcoholic zang at the end of the beer, I think that's the only improvement that can be made.

Availability for me limits my ability to secure this at any peak freshness, but even now it's still showing some resiliance in hop flavour, and I dig and respect that.

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a translucent orange color with two fingers of off white foam atop it. The head fades quickly leaving a wispy coaster and some pretty darned good lacing for a single IPA. The aroma is of wet, dank hops backed by a tinge of sweet malt. Taste follows. Dank hemp and a mild bitterness nicely balanced by a biscuity malt presence. The beer never gives in to intense bitterness or sweet maltiness, but maintains a pleasant compromise that works in it's favor. The finish is bittersweet and lush with juicy citrus notes. A medium body lends itself to the very nice feel of this brew. Carbonation is appropriate for the style giving the beer a somewhat creamy texture as it warms. Drinkability is quite good given the pleasing balance and great taste of this offering from Founders. I like it!","Sideswipe","Mar 14, 2011"

4.45,7.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, earthy bitterness up front that lingers throughout over the sweet citrus and caramel malt flavors into a slight dry finish. There's a prominent resinous pine hop presence up front that gives this beer it's wonderful dry bitterness. This is wonderfully complimented by a subtle citrus character that gives off hints of grapefruit, pineapple and orange rind. Underneath, there's a subtle malt backbone that provides excellent balance without killing off the hop flavor. Not as toasty or prominent as the aroma suggests with faint hints of caramel as well as some biscuit and graham cracker. The ABV is excellently masked with only faint alcohol flavor toward the end of the swallow, making this beer dangerously drinkable. The ABV is too high for it to be considered a session beer but it's so well balanced and quaffable I could see myself drinking a bunch of these in one night.","corby112","Mar 06, 2011"

It pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, flowers, fake grape (sniff a piece of Bubble-Yum grape gum for a proper analogue), and caramel. The taste holds notes of sharp pine, grapefruit, and a nice flow of moderate toffee. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that seems to want to be sticky.

I notice that these hopps have held up very well, since my first 3 weeks ago. One of the best IPA's I have had. Hope this won't be my last 6 pack, because they don't distribute in my state.

I think that as a homebrewer, I am exposed to the best ingredients in raw and final form--this beer tastes and smells just like Centennial hops from a new vacuum sealed pack. It has that fruit loops aroma, with a woody depth and grapefruit punch. On the pallet, the hops provide great flavor of fresh peeled pomelo and juicy tangerines.

The taste is a hop bomb. It isn't as balanced as the nose would lead to believe. It's a very good IPA and one for the fans of a heavy hop flavor. It also leaves a nice clean but bitter and dry feeling in my mouth. The crisp tingle is from the ABV methinks and the brew is definitely not syrupy which I dig..but overall a bit too dry and a bit too hop heavy for what I look for in an IPA.","cosmicevan","Nov 28, 2010"

Despite its relative smoothness it is still a very full-flavored brew. However, this is one of the more drinkable IPAs that I've sampled. I wouldn't hesitate to hand one of these to someone to initiate them to the style. It's quite good, even straight from the bottle.","weizenbob","Oct 17, 2010"

On the nose it's a citrus combination of lemon and orange, maybe wet straw, a nice nose. On the tongue there is the citrus right up front that fades into a pretty deep hop bitterness that sticks around. Maybe some sweeter notes in there, too. I'll have to revisit that as my palate develops. In the mouth the feel is a light-medium body. Some IPAs are like buzzsaws, this is more restrained and pleasant. Overall I like this beer and can drink a few of them in a row with no problem. One of the better IPAs I'm familiar with, right there with Two-Hearted and Stone.","EricCioe","Oct 15, 2010"

The combination of hops bitterness, caramelized malt and citrus sweetness blend together excellently. The hops flavor is the slightly more dominant one and comes out a little bit in the after-taste, but that's to be expected. Very smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, clean & dry finish. This beer has all of the elements to be the one that you stay with all night long.

Problem with the keg, perhaps? Definitely not the scorchingly bitter brew I remember, although still quite tasty and enjoyable.

Smells of blatant hops and some caramel and malt notes. There's obviously a lot of hops in the taste, but it's well balanced by the malt. Malt flavor is obviously present, but is muted enough to just balance the hops bitterness without overpowering it. It has a very nice medium body with slight creaminess. It's very drinkable.

There were ring's of lacing that followed the head as I sipped. The scent was perfect for an IPA, very hoppy and spicy with some piney notes. A slightly sweet citrusy taste up front is balanced off nicely by a very nice bitter finish. There is about as good of a balance as one would want with an IPA. This is nice IPA, I only wish I bought more than 1 in a mix pack. I should have known it would be great coming from Founders.","beergod1","Aug 29, 2010"
4.03,-2.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Served up a reddish amber with a frothy white head that leaves near perfect lacing. The aroma is wonderfully fresh and hoppy with plenty of grapefruity, and slightly pithy character. I also detect a healthy helping of caramel malt that gives the nose some sugary tropical like notes as well. The flavor is just as nice as the aroma and is full of grapefruit, pine, bitter pith and biscuity, slightly caramel malt. This beer is quite bitter, but also quite malty. It seems like the two opposites play off each other and improve the hop flavor as a result. Whatever the reason, this IS a tasty beverage. The body is medium, and a bit heavier than your run of the mill IPA, but not out of control. It is super smooth and the finish is well balanced. Very drinkable, and another contender on my list of go to IPAs.","zoso1967","Aug 26, 2010"

Smooth and balanced are the words that come to mind as I drink this. Not extreme one way of the other. I very nice hop bite and bitterness followed by a silky maltiness.

Piney hop aromas. Taste was very nice as well with the hops dominant but well-balanced with some maltiness. A bit more subdued perhaps than I was hoping in my twisted hop-loving mind, but really really solid. As a result, it's incredibly drinkable for an IPA with 7.2% abv, maybe dangerously so. I could definitely drink 5 or 6 in a row, and the only thing that would suffer is my behavior. Another great beer from Founders, who can pretty much do no wrong.

Unique and complex taste with mandarin oranges, tea, fresh hop resin, pine, and grapefruit, all complemented by a solid sweet malt base. Great chewy, thick mouthfeel without being syrupy.

4.05,-2.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured this into my tulip. Looks a nice amber color with about an inch of frothy off white head with big bubbles. Good retention on this guy. Little pockets of visible carbonation are apparent on the side. Smells great, a nice floral bouquet of piney hops and citrus. Is that pineapple I smell? Not quite as juicy as the smell led me to believe, but a delicious hop flavor none the less. I would love to taste more of that outstanding citrus I got in the nose, however, it's not absent, just not a prevalent as I was led to believe. Pretty good mouth feel but a little bit syrupy. The carbonation is perfect though. 7.2 seems a little bit of a high abv for an IPA like this, but I'm not scared off by something like that, I just think I would only have one in a sitting. Also, the how syrupy this is detracts a little bit and it isn't as refreshing as I want from the style.","Bendurgin","Jun 24, 2010"

Tastes much the same of how it smells which is awesome, very clean and crisp hop flavors here with a nice caramel malt sweetness underneath the hops. A nice balance of piney floral hops in this beer. The hop flavors don't linger on the palate for long which quickly makes you wanna take another sip followed by another. Very smooth mouthfeel with a light almost medium mouthfeel.

I don't get to drink too many IPAs that aren't west coast very often, but this one pretty much tastes like I expected...but a little better. The sweet caramel and malts are right up front and the bitter hops linger on the back of the tongue. This beer has a slight chewiness to it, which I enjoy.

The pine makes itself known early and then a lemon/orange citrus lingers. There's a peppery pine that dominates the taste. The citrus just seems to hang around offering subtle grapefruit notes. There's also a tropical fruit thing going on if you wait long enough between drinks. This isn't hugely bitter until the end, but the malts add to a very nice balance. I really like the bitter finish this beer leaves. Somehow the resiny hops and carbonation this beer has makes it feel more viscous than it actually is. Another winner from Founders.","alkemy","May 16, 2010"

The aroma is full of juicy hops, very floral with a hint of tropical fruit. The flavor is of a tropical fruit hop profile with some grassy hop bitterness towards the end. Perhaps a touch of asprin. The tropical fruit hop flavor blends nicely with the steely caramel malt, good transition between the two. The grassy bitterness helps cut the sweetness. The beer has a moderate feel with fizzy carbonation, sweet overall but finishes with a hoppy bitterness; slightly sticky.

The flavor is similar to the aroma with a big centennial blast upfront (citrusy, piney, resiny, etc.), followed by some caramel sweetness, fruity esters, biscuity malt, and an alcohol wallop. The mouthfeel is on the thick/oily side, and drinkability is good for the style/ABV.

3.54,-14.5,5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours out a hazy orange-red with a two finger, white head. The head is very frothy/creamy and retains very nicely. A huge coat of lacing starts to be left during the first sips. The frothy head seems to almost solidify at one and a half fingers. Some of the best lacing and head I have ever seen. Smell consists of a good dose of earthy, floral and some fruity hops. The hops are balanced out by a nice malt backbone that has some caramel scent to it. The strength is nice and makes for a good aroma. Perhaps a bit more hop aroma and a bit less of the caramelly malt would work better for my IPA expectations, still a good smell though. Taste is pretty much the same. The bitterness comes through at a very good level for my taste. It helps the hop flavors (earthy, floral, pine mostly for me). A bit of an orange peel flavor comes through also. The malt backbone is still highly present and helps balance the beer. Once again it seems like the hops die down except for the bitterness. I would like the hop flavor to shine for the whole experience. I am left with a nice flavor though, just more malty than I would like. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with low-medium carbonation. A bit more carbonation would help for the flavors and some creaminess to the body too. A nice coat of bitters is left on the tongue. The creaminess would help make it feel less watery. Drinkability is good. The beer tastes good and has a decent six-pack price. The alcohol is well hidden and does not come through at all. I could session this but at the same price the Red's Rye PA has a better flavor and is a better beer. A nice example of bittering levels and malt backbone but falls short on actual hop flavor for an IPA, IMO.","cbutova","Mar 03, 2010"

The nose is powerful but balanced between the big, fresh hops that one would expect of this style but also a strong but overly sweet maltiness. The taste is remarkable. The hop/malt balance that was on the nose persists on the palate, with a fascinating interplay of citrus and resinous hops, each of them strong but neither overwhelming, with caramelly and other malts; not a bad amount of yeastiness, neither.

My previous bottles had no bottled date on them, so they must have been at least 6+ months old. These are less then a month, and it tastes identical to Southern Tier IPA.

The hop aroma hits you as soon as it begins to pour. With strong citrus and piney notes. The smell of a great IPA right there! The hops hit you with every drink of this beer. The depth is there too not overly complex but it isn't just a lot of hops, it has a good amount of malts with the pine and citrus. A great beer all around and something that I routinely find myself drinking.","beerad666","Sep 01, 2009"

Overall this beer had a great scent but the taste wasn't quite as fresh or clean. It still had good flavor and body, and was generally quite enjoyable. It felt like this cost more than a typical IPA, but that might just be due to market-wide price increases (due to hops shortage or taxes?).

Strong haze to the zinc orange color, overall closer to red than yellow, hardly any fade around the rims. Very good penetrating power to the nose but it's more remarkable for its balance, on one side the pink grapefruit, dried flowers, green corn husk and pine, on the other scone, mocha, malt powder, whisper of apricot or red apple fruit scents. Medium-bodied, very sturdy and has broad shoulders although in no way, shape or form trying to over-impress. Has more of a sour nip than bitter bite, keeps control of the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus as well as any greenness in the hops. Cocoa and milk chocolate powder pair up with scone to biscuit flavors and golden raisin, fig to apricot fruit. The carbonation possesses pleasing activity but the bubbles are fine and don't truly scrub. Determined to last through the finish.

The bitter hoppyness is not as overpowering as with many IPAs and some chocolate and carmel flavors are blended in to create an awesome brew.

A tad smooth and creamy for an IPA, with citric/floral hop notes in the taste tucked in a medium-body that goes down a little slick. Some caramel and roasted malts balance the beer and give it some sweetness and lead to a pleasant and not overbearing dry backbite.

First few sips in and it's just as pleasant as I had imagined. Very, very clean with just a little and I mean little bit of the stickiness I find in a lot of other big IPAs. The malt is present but a little downplayed. The beer is full bodied but lean at the same time. I use well-balanced a lot but here again is a well-balanced beer. Not much on the fruity side either. A really straight forward IPA. It presents it's musclely (I made that word up) hops on a platter of tightly constructed malt and says, "here you go, the game's on, you can drink a couple more and be happy."

The flavor comes in two segments. There is a definite grainy and bready malt consistency and this segues into more acerbic hop bite. the malts do penetrate into the finish a bit, but the hop bite and the ABV are really in the finish of the beer. There is also a slightly drying floral quality in the finish as well. The ABV comes through in the end, and it turns a bit boozy, but not overly so.

Lots of carbonation bubbles coming up from this one. Sediment was left in the bottle, but some little specs made their way through. I could smell the bitter citrus fruit hoppiness as I was pouring it into the glass. Very nice grapefruit and orange aroma. Taste is not outrageously bitter, but a good smack of bitter orange peel and grapefruit rind coats the tongue and sticks around well after the swallow. Very good hop flavor and not too much caramel malt to get in the way. Decently balanced. Medium bodied, lots of carbonation. goes down very smooth.

This brew has a great aroma of tropical fruit, wet grass, a faint note of biscuit, with some pine coming through as well. Highly drinkable beer for a higher than average ABV and the taste balances the alcohol very well. Pine flavor, oily hop character, citrus, rind, mango, and a touch of mint aftertaste shines through. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Refreshing, this a great ale for any season. Definitely worth trying over and over again.","JRed","Dec 27, 2008"

They dry-hopped this till it screamed! Super citrusy flavors. Everything from grapefruit to pineapple, tastes like hop infused grapefruit juice. Real nice malt profile not only balances the citrus hops but enhances them as well. Bitterness seems lower than 46 IBUs and is very smooth and refreshing. No harsh hop bite at all. Good medium body with perfect carbonation. Overall, a super delicious IPA from Founders. I was a little skeptical at first smell. Thought it would be slightly harsh but boy was I wrong.

It doesn't leave a lingering after taste like some I've tried before. For those who love the very aggressive hoppy beers this might not be the "one" for them. For someone like me who wants something with a nice hoppy nip this is a great choice. Its balance makes it drinkable.

According to Founders website, the BJCP has chosen this brew as a benchmark for the American IPA style. It pours a toasted orange/amber color, with low carbonation and two fingers of off-white head that sticks quite well. Caramel and citrus in the nose (most notably orange and grapefruit), with spicy hops and maybe a touch of nuttiness. Very similar on the palate - hefty citrus backed by lots of malts - with a large, but manageable bitterness, and just a touch too much malt sweetness for my liking. Very dry, medium body imparts lots of coating hop oils that last and last. Definitely an IPA worth checking out.","mmmbeer","Mar 18, 2008"

The aroma is floral and citrusy with a bit of bready malt as well. This is not an especially bitter IPA, but it has loads of citrus/flower flavour from what must be a large, late kettle addition of its namesake Centennial hops. Bready flavours dominate in the malt department wich are obviously there in a suppoting role only. The body is rather light and dry wich seems to help the hop character shine. I would like to see a little more malt complexity, but that is just my opinion. If the brewer wanted more malt in this beer it would be there. Nicely done.","mjryan","Dec 25, 2007"

Pours a hazy, golden with decent rocky head but head has somewhat poor retention. Particles in suspension and some lacing as well. Smell is crisp and clear and full of hops, there is some underlying malt but mainly hops. Taste is, as expected, nice and hoppy. A good IPA example, strong hops with a touch of malt. Moderate carbonation leads to a medium mouthfeel and an hoppy oily aftertaste, almost a little too much for my liking.

Maybe I will edit when I try a fresh sample in the future, but for now it detracts. Thankfully, the flavor does not seem to be affected.

Color was deep amber, small creamy white head with a little bit of lacing. Smell was mostly hops, a little sweet but some earthiness to it as well. Taste was really off--there was some sweetness in front with a dry bitterness from the hops behind that just didn't jive well. Not that either of those things are bad per se, but in this beer, or at least my bottle, they didn't work together.

Aroma pure Centennials no false advertisement here just grapefruit upon grapefruit peel much like our good friend Two Hearted. Aroma yes I will compare this to that Bell's brew, because this is in the same category and caliber with the same single hop. Grapefruits are delicious especially in hop form, sugary malt components flow freely damn those are some fresh hops. Flavor such drinkable components such as the grape fruit pith and peel damn what a great hop with the sugary mild biscuit hop combo I could live on this IPA so tasty and zesty at that. Mouthfeel is mellow with even carbonation and slick oily carbonation, one fine medium bodied brew that delivers the way it should. Drinkability is equal with Bell's Two Hearted this is the street version that I prefer on it's own and Bell's Two Hearted pairs better with cuisine.

4.12,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Purchased at Merchant's Fine Wine in Dearborn last week. This poured honey golden in the glass, clear with a thin off-white head. Slow but steady stream of small bubble carbonation looks inviting. The head quickly spreads out to thinly coat the surface with a good ring and lacing. Smells very hoppy, banana, cantaloupe, vanilla, spice. Taste is dry with a flash of tartness, bitter, hoppy impressions are pronounced but not over the top, a nice drinking IPA. Mouthfeel was smooth with a lingering ginger-hoppy aftertaste. A swirl produces a regenerated head until the end of the glass. The 7.2% alcohol is well hidden in the mix. I found this to be comparable to the better IPA's I've tasted and I'll try to grab a six pack next time along with the other Founders products, the Bells, the Jolly Pumpkin and Dragonmead offerings - to name but a small sampling of what Merchant's in Dearborn offers.","ThatWineGuy","Oct 17, 2007"

It has a very bitter hop flavor along with a solid malt base that goes down with ease and warms on the finish. The hops are well pronounced and piney; just the way I like them. The mouthfeel is fine.

Flavors of sweet pine and blood orange with a little more early-hop bitterness on the finish. The alcohol pokes its head out here and there, but mostly behaves itself as long as things don't warm up too much. It lost a little on the drinkability because while it is not too hoppy for me, something about its character - the late bitterness perhaps - kept hanging around so that I wanted a break from the flavor. A rock solid American IPA though overall though. Maybe east coast meets west coast?","dedrinker","Jul 02, 2007"
4.68,13,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours an intensely turbid, light amber color. Lots of hops floatings around in this one (don't think it's yeast). Big old white foamy head forms. This one is a hoppy bastard. Plenty of grapefruit in the aroma. It really is like opening up a hop sack. Centennials are much higher in AA than cascade but smell almost identical. Not a whole lot of malt profile coming through in the nose, a slight crystal malt toastiness, but not much else. On the palate, this is one of the most beautifully crafter IPAs. The hops make a pronounced impression with their flavor and aroma but without a biting bitterness. This one is almost too malty, making it slightly out of balance for my taste; I would like to see some more bite to it. Carbonation is quite low, almost like cask, very nice. I prefer hoppy beers like this to be lower in carbonation than most commercial varieties. Anyway, this is a damn good IPA, perhaps the best beer I've had from Founder's and one I wish was local.","dreadnatty08","Jul 01, 2007"

Taste is very complex. A bready pine hop (if that makes any sense) flavor up front that fizzles to a dry pale malty hop flavor (once again, if that makes any sense). I really like how much flavor this one has, it's all over the place but in a good way, all the flavors are very enjoyable. Pretty full bodied for this style with a good amount of bubbles. Quite drinkable, I could easily put a few down in one sitting. The bit of alcohol on the tongue does take away from the drinkability though.

3.66,-11.6,3,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The taste is tart up front, but more from the hop character than anything. A solid biting bitterness leaves a tingling sensation on my tongue. The beer seems to taste a bit murky for some reason, though I am not entirely sure yet if this is a bad thing or not. Dusty biscuit-like malt notes and a crystal malt character are in evidence as well. Actually the murky notes seem to stem from the malt character; it is just a bit much for this to work as a pure celebration of the Centennial hops. Not a bad beer certainly, but it could use some bright, clean, sweet malt notes to accentuate the hops a bit more. While the aroma ran towards the sweet side of the citrus hop spectrum, the flavor has more of a tart edge to it. Again it is a grapefruit note that dominates, but there is a touch of sour orange and perhaps even a slight tangerine note. A solid beer, and one which I certainly enjoy drinking.","Gueuzedude","Dec 29, 2006"

Hops are dominant from start to finish, but only slightly. I'm not feeling the malt. Very little balance that I could detect. Does the centennial denote the type of hops used? If so, where did they get this crop from? I'm not getting the signature fruity pebbles/froot loops qualities that I so much enjoy from this hop varietal.

Begins with a wave of sweet toasted malt, and is overcome by the pleasent centennial hops. Bitter, yet smooth. It has a somewhat thick mouthfeel for an IPA. Not that this is bad at all. Leaves a clean feeling in your mouth. Drinkability is high. I will continue to purchase this beer for as long as it's available to me.

The taste is also very nice, fruity up front, orange and lemon zest. Some piney notes in the middle, very nice, and a sweet herbal hop kick in the end...even the exhaust is bitter....nice.

Poured out to a nice burnt amber color with some cloudiness. Medium low carbonation, with a nice foamy head and some nice lace rings around the glass. Aroma was very acidic, almost like a pine tree and grapefruit had hooked up, and this was the product. Some sweet floral notes and hops in there too. Taste was suprisingly inviting, but still bitter enought to remind one that this is an IPA. Flavors of hops, hops and more hops, and traces of caramel. The hops were nearly overpowering the hints of earth, sweetness and wood that lay low in the complexity, but that may be a desireable aspect for some. Finished rather oily, like a thin layer had been left behind. Good mouthfeel, not over powering or too thick and heavy.

Bubbles ascend nicely throughout the glass. Lace is minimal. The smell is sharp and hoppy. Citrus and floral smells help to complete the boldness of the aroma. The initial nose intake is most impressive. The tase is very hoppy, but well-balanced. Citrus flavors (grapefruit) are evident. There is also a nice, bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full and lowly carbonated. There is a bitterness that remains, but not so sharp as to preclude an overall balance. Overall, this is one of those beers that is smooth enough to be a session brew, but too strong unless you want to get into trouble. It has good flavor, high, but not noticeable, alcohol content and is unbelieveably well balanced. In a way this is a bit dangerous in how easy it it to tip back.","macpapi","Aug 12, 2005"

The finish is very dry and a tad too much. I would like to see what this beer would be like with a different bittering hop.

3.95,-4.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Centennial pours a hazy, unfiltered, apricot orange body with a small offwhite head that quickly falls into persistent collar and film with some clingy lace on the glass. Aroma is assertive with hops. Citrusy grapefruit and some mandarin orange, with some resinous pine sap. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and has a mild hops bite. Taste is mostly bitter hops. Grapefruit and pine resin are present all the way into the finish. Vague caramel malt flavors are noted underneath. Finish and aftertaste are bitter pine cone hops. Nice IPA for hopheads, but lacks the balance and flavor of the brewery's rye ales. Another thank you to brewedlyhooked for this Founders hookup.","merlin48","Mar 23, 2005"
4.49,8.5,4,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Wow, this is good. Pours a light amber, compact head. Slight chill haze in this. I usually get a stickier head out of an IPA, but this is good with me. This has one of the best aromas of an IPA that I've ever had. Sticky, piney, resiny aroma. Wow. Taste is actually balanced a bit. Glad they didn't go too over-the-top. Enough sweetness to balance the malts. Mouthfeel is a bit powdery, could use more thickness, more body, more viscosity. I find this to be a very drinkable IPA. Perhaps a new standard? Definatly my favorite Michigan IPA from the ones I've had.","deejaydan","Mar 16, 2005"

4.1,-1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is the beer that opened up my eyes and swept me away from the mundane monotony of mass produced beers. Thinking this was an "ordinary" sixer, I proceeded unpretentiously to uncap and poor. First, the color was a pleasantly murky, rich brown thing of beauty. You see, I was completely unfamiliar with any of the finer things in life at this point in mine. Next, a modest head creamed up ( I say modest now after sampling a few "huge headed beers", but at the time it was quite impressive to me). When I say creamed, that is what it really looked like compared to the bubbly insubstantial foam offered up by some of the less fortunate beers I had encountered up to this point. Now, I know it may seem like I am embellishing a touch, but in fact, this was a spiritual rebirth for me as far as beer drinking is concerned. I remember it vividly and it will always be sacred. The nose was a sensory delight of fruity tones and rich hop aroma. Then the taste...SMACK!...ecstasy. A true revelation to me. I understand now that centennial is a strain of hops, but I didn't know anything about it before this first sip. I am still a newbie to conissuer lingo, but I can say this hopped out to high heaven flavor really flipped my wig. I like me some centennial hops brothers and sisters! "Kind Beer for goodness sakes!" The flavor pelts the taste buds and finishes with that nice dry ending and slightly acidic bite that I have come to love. Mouthfeel seems to vary at times, or maybe it is just me becoming sensitized and spoiled by the deliciously textured goodness. Overall, mouthfeel is good everytime and occasionally great depending on frequency of consumption. Taste is always over the top with hoppy, fruity, earthy, bitter, hints of sweetness here and there. Well balanced for a beer of this style (in my newbie opinion of course). I did not know there was a characteristic called "lace" when I first drank this beer, but I can now tell you this beer produces a sparse amount compared to some. I personally don't by beer based upon lacing capabilities or massive head production. I mainly look for taste, and this one does it for me. Good lord I am rambling as if it were one of my grandchildren or something. Drinkability is way too good for me. My first encounter (the draining of a six pack) left me absolutely adrift in alcoholic toastiness. Although some may pretend to be civilized in tasting and rating of characteristics, we all know that the alcohol is always in the mix adding magic to the process. I thoroughly enjoy getting intoxicated on this beer! Enough is enough. I love this beer. It was a gateway into a world that has so much to show me. No more suffering with the same old same old. Try it out, especially if you don't normally drink "microbrews." It could change your life too.","SupaCelt","Feb 06, 2005"

Nice lacing was left around the glass for the duration of the beer. Aroma was quite hoppy with citric hops with a soft undertone of sweet malt. Notes of pine were also present. Taste started out a bit sweet with caramel before the expected grapefruity hop rush came into play. This is definitely quite juicy with hops and finishes with a slightly bitter sweet hop bite. Mouthfeel was on par for the style with a solid medium body and a smooth feel. This is definitely drinkable.

As in the nose, the taste has citrus and hops fighting for dominance, with the hops winning out in the end, but oh, what a flavor that is formed by their competition.

The body is full of particles and floaties that surely portend of the yeast that is a part of the great aroma. The nose is full of yeast and citrus hops at the start, but equally strong on the lovely malt base. The flavor is just great, with thick sweet malts and lovely bittering following from the heavy hopping. Much less citrus hopping on the flavor than in the aroma.
