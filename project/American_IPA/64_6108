A well balanced IPA, featuring a bit of citrus hops, some noticeable malt, and a bit of grass. More malt than my ideal, but so well balanced I have to be impressed. Very solid.","RobbDogg","Wednesday at 02:52 PM"

Has a generic hop smell with some grassy, earthy tones and a hint of citrus, also there was a little bit of a malty aroma. Taste reflects this aswell, but what kind of stood out to me was how noticeable the malt was, also the alcohol was fairly noticeable. It was fairly light, and pretty drinkable. It was pretty good, but fairly different than the IPAs I have been drinking lately. Honestly after reading other reviews I might have drank it a little too cold.","Joe_Howard","Apr 02, 2015"

Its good, nothing exceptional. i can think of four or five ipa's off the top of my head from Chicago breweries that id choose over this any and everyday. If its the only beer available like twas the case today i would gladly drink it. If you havent had it id recommend trying it. But i dont really see myself picking this up.

4.39,7.3,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a clear amber body with three fingers of foamy, thick white head that receded slowly to a ring of lacing. It looks like a rather nice IPA, quite enticing. Scents of citrus zest upfront quickly leading into vegetal, earthy, dank hops, light pine resin, hints of juniper berry and sour, wild red berries, floral hop aromas and a distinct backbone of bready, biscuit-like malt with some light sweetness. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice, rather complex IPA done in the East Coast style with less overt pine, citrus and none of the tropical fruit seen in West Coast examples. This makes it pleasantly balanced yet still quite hoppy and very nice. Flavor begins with medium-high bitterness, beginning with flavors of citrus zest and light amounts of pine resin before moving into bitter, earthy, dank, herbal hop flavors. Middle is high in bitterness with a pronounced floral character, with notes of citrus blossom and jasmine. Finish is high in bitterness with notes of pine resin, bitter herbal hops and light notes of floral hops, again mostly citrus blossom. Light berry-like notes appear in the middle and even less on the finish. A lightly sweet and bready malt backbone is discernible throughout, continuing into the aftertaste. The aftertaste begins with a light bready malt flavor that quickly gives way to bitter hop flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely hoppy IPA that has a nice level of bitterness, but also a good depth and complexity of floral, fruity, herbal and resinous flavors to make it intriguing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, oily, resinous slickness. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good IPA, classic and true to style. Overall this is a fantastic American IPA. It keeps away from the overwhelming maltiness that damages some East Coast examples, keeping hop character high, all the while maintaining a distinct identity from the West Coast hop bombs. A balanced and well executed beer on all counts and quite worth the price point.","Auraan","Jan 31, 2015"

Thinner than 90 Minute, more traditional tasting IPA (when compared to 90 Min) Nice dry finish, with a malty sweetness undertone throughout.  A little but of orange on the nose, but predominately, floral, earthy, and piney hops.  It's really balanced.... great beer.","DudeBeerYaBro","Nov 23, 2014"

Not the "after mowing the lawn" refreshing but the after a long day of work refreshing. The flavor is solid and doesn't overdo it on the hops making it an easy back to back beer after a long day. Or really, any time you want a tasty quality beverage. Will definitely be buying this again.","MrPilstout","Nov 22, 2014"

The taste was full of hop flavor but with a nice balance which ended in a semi-sweet crisp finish that was very refreshing. A classic by my standards and a must try for those getting into craft beer.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 13, 2014"

It has a gorgeous, deep orange-gold body and great head retention with sticky lacing throughout. The aroma is sensually floral and citrusy but reminded me of catching wafts of fresh-baked cookies from three rooms away at home: nostalgia in a bottle. Highly drinkable, it is easy going down with a strong, clean day-on-the-lake finish and satisfyingly bitter aftertaste that sticks around.","ob_carr","Sep 15, 2014"

4.11,0.5,,,,,,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger slightly off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready, slightly caramel malt, grassy hops with light pine, citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is dominated by resiny pine and citrus hops with a bit of hay, citrus rind and mild malt. Finishes with well balanced citrus and resinous piney hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. This was one of my breakthrough IPAs back in the day and I approached this bottle with a little trepidation. There have been some awesome IPAs produced in the interim, and I am frequently slightly underwhelmed by East Coast IPAs now, preferring the West Coast hop varieties. No need to worry, this has held up well, still an excellent flavor blend of hops, nice assertive hop bitterness and a neutral, but supportive malt body. One of the classic IPAs. Off the market in my area for a long time and welcome back.","LiquidAmber","Sep 09, 2014"

4.25,3.9,,,,,,"I am typically a lager drinker but this is my go-to when I am ready for some hop bitterness...The beer pours with a perfect head and solid carbonation; the slight chill haze wore off as the beer warmed in the glass. I think this beer is actually smoother and more drinkable as it moves from fridge temp to cellar temp to room temp. Refreshing, super-smooth, nicely balanced and a tangy hop finish that leads you to the next swig. I think the Dogfish Head guys are superb, all of their beers are well engineered and show off their creativity and professionalism.","Reegze79","Aug 30, 2014"

4.25,3.9,,,,,,"Poured from bottle to frosted pint glass. Pours a nice yellow to golden color with about a finger or so of foam that laces the glass nicely. Smells first of bread and malt, but subtle notes of citrus (lemon mostly) come through at the end. Taste is of the malt/breadiness at firSt, but a piney/citrusy taste dominates at the end as with most IPAs the taste is a bit better than the aroma in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a perfect crisp carbonation. Overall it is a great beer, but I prefer the 90 minute much more!","anthony23cippy","Aug 30, 2014"

This beer does an exemplary job of allowing you to taste everything the beer has to offer without drowning you with hops.  One of the few IPA's that can be drank as an everyday beer (or session beer as it's called).","dannymo","Aug 24, 2014"

3.99,-2.4,4,3.75,4,4,4.25,"A great sessionable hoppy IPA. Very excellent citrusy, yet lemony note, has good hoppy notes with some peach notes and malty, sweet character to balance it. Rich, complex, and hoppy. Not too hoppy to be an easy session IPA for hop fanatics. A good Dogfish Head brew. Very solid. I drank this in bottles. And it is easily available in Tennessee outside liquor stores, so can be had more places. I like DFH 90 minute ale even better, but this is a better brew to drink often. I recommend it to every IPA fanatic. Well balanced for a big ale.","KentT","Jun 26, 2014"

3.66,-10.5,4.5,3.5,3.25,4.5,4,"First off I want to point out that it is possible that the kegs I drank this from may not have been at optimal freshness. I had this at a bar in JFK airport in NY, and then later that night at the bar at the Hilton in Florida. Poured beautiful and golden brown from the tap, with a thick and creamy 2 finger head. The lacing on the glass was incredible and was still present when our server took the empty glass. The aroma I experienced was of muted pine and sweet malt. As for taste, I wasn't overly impressed; mostly sweet bready malts with some piney hop flavors. Overall I found a severe lack of hop flavor and an overwhelming malt presence, not the sort of balance I expected given all the hype surrounding this beer. Again I believe freshness may have played a part and I'll have to examine further and update!","AngryPenguinBrewCo","Jun 24, 2014"

3.77,-7.8,3,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"This is a classic hoppy (but not super hoppy) IPA. Crisp, clean hoppy bitterness, with distinct carbonation. As other reviewers have noted, this is more sessionable than the 90 min IPA, but less assertive/exciting. Also, the faint citrus sweetness, and noticeable malt backbone, give this beer character but also somewhat detract from the purity of the IPA. This is a fine beer but not my go-to IPA or the best that Dogfish has to offer.","AmyfaceNYC","May 25, 2014"

When I first had this beer I thought it was beer then the 90 minute but since I've been on a beer fest... This beer doesn't have a great punch to it... Not as hoppy as I thought.. Still a beer I like to sip on here and there.. It has a dark golden look to it.. Not to much of a hoppy smell... It's a solid beer.","Guess2814","May 20, 2014"

Personally, the hop/malt balance is skewed too much to the latter for me. But I can't deny this is a fantastic IPA to cut your teeth on (I should know - a bought a case of this stuff 3 years ago just for that intent).","ThisWangsChung","May 10, 2014"

Nice look overall. Clean citrus (lemon, grapefruit), some pine, and a nice bitter nose. Nice balance to the taste. Clean bitterness, floral and pine notes, and just an overall freshness. Clean aftertaste, medium to light mouthfeel, and quite refreshing. Overall, balanced, hoppy, what a great deal for a 6er under 10 bucks. This will be an occasional fridge visitor when I find dates this good!","Mikus","Mar 23, 2014"

The overall aspects of this beer are great, but I am left with more pronounced flavors to be desired. If this were labeled as a pale ale, I would've given a higher score. However, this is a good sessionable AIPA.","Bone53","Feb 23, 2014"

And the flavor....hoppy, balanced, and smooth. Bitterness is not overwhelming but very enjoyable. Sips refreshing and bright. Overall everything a basic IPA should be. However, if you truly want to experience IPA nirvana....take the money you'd spend on a 6 of this and get the 4 of 90 minute. You won't regret either choice. But you'll only relish in the latter.","lochef81","Jan 02, 2014"

Some spicy hops as well. The taste is bready with some spicy hop notes. Pine hops more towards the middle with some light caramel malts. A hint of lemon. Lots of carbonation with a light body and slick mouthfeel. I was shocked to see that I had never gotten around to reviewing this beer, although I've had it a ton of times.

I first had it on draft and I was surprised at the perfect balance of bitterness and floral notes with a modest ABV% for an IPA of course. It is a everyday IPA that is my new go to beer when I'm in the mood to just drink some beer! This high hop concoction is the perfect pairing with spicy food.","Lederer85","Nov 17, 2013"

Years later of venturing off into various types of IPA's I found myself giving this a shot again. In many ways this is the archtype of an IPA- not too hoppy, and very well rounded. It doesn't have the luxurious mouthfeel of "Sierra Nevada - Torpedo", or the full on punch in the face of "Ithaca Brewing - Flower Power" - but it damn sure is hearty and satisfying in its beautiful golden/bronze glory. Never a bad choice.","-MK-","Nov 15, 2013"

Definitely an IPA as it hits your tounge wit a bitter bite that finishes with fermented lemony aftertaste. Slightly thin that make drinking easy on a sunny afternoon.

Overall, this is easily one of the most drinkable IPAs one can find while still offering an impressive flavor profile. This really is a beer that one could drink any day of the year and not be disappointed. Again, this isn't supposed to compete with the 120 minute IPA for hop flavor, but instead is supposed to offer a great alternative for someone looking for a session beer, and this succeeds wonderfully.","DeFaz","Oct 17, 2013"

Rich depth and bitter edge make this an ideal choice for one's regular beer. I found the taste strong without being overpowering: strong, edgy bitterness with a bit of citrus, but multi-faceted and balanced. I'm anxious to try the 90 and 120 on another occasion.

Mouthfeel is good. All in all, a solid, tasty IPA that's readily available for a decent price. Having had a bunch of this stuff though, I'd say it's only worth buying when it's fresh. It falls off pretty quickly and there's a lot of old 60 min sitting around out there... Thankfully they have easy to read bottling dates.","dougfur","Sep 08, 2013"

Slightly sticky mouthfeel.","Franziskaner","Aug 13, 2013"

At first sip, it seems like it will be a bitter beer, but it mellows out as the drinking continues. I had this beer with seafood on the Gulf of Mexico and couldn't have been a better experience.","Akfindlay","Aug 13, 2013"

Floral hops, pine and grapefruit in the flavor balanced perfectly by malt backbone. Smooth mouthfeel with nice carbonation. The hops assert themselves without slapping you in the face like too many IPAs. An outstandingly balanced east-coast IPA that should be in every IPA lovers rotation.","JohnG190","Jun 28, 2013"

4.1,0.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"60 Minute IPA is a hazy, light amber color with about a half inch of foam, clnging nicely to the glass. Very carbonated, with no pieces of sediment visible. The aroma evokes the scent of sweet baked goods, along with a pleasing pine fragrance. With a sip, I find it toasty, bready, as well as nutty, buttery, and sweet. The lemon/citrus hop flavors come in and initially are not too bitter...until the finish kicks in with a harsher and dryer wave washing over the palate. It's a medium feeling beer and totally drinkable. An iconic IPA, this is one of the beers that made me fall in love with the style and craft beer in general. For fans of the style with a bit of a malt balance, it's the 'all day' IPA before Founders coined the term.","Neorebel","May 21, 2013"

This is a good beer and it introduced some flavors I had not yet experienced. For an IPA, this has a floral and citrus sweetness that is well balanced with the slight hop bitterness. It's not a complicated beer. No, it's a good spring beer. Its taste reminds me of fresh cut grass and budding flowers. This one is worth a shot, but Dogfish Head certainly has better.","jmendels","Apr 14, 2013"

5,22.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall this is one of the greats, I recommend this beer for anyone including those who tend to stray from IPAs. I recommend pulling a bottle out and letting it sit on the counter for 15 - 30 minutes, pour into a glass at room temperature and enjoy. For about $10 - $12 bucks for a six pack you cant go wrong. This is a perfect beer for beginner craft beer drinkers.","THErealDK","Apr 13, 2013"

Some might think this is basically the "light" version of DFH's minute series, but I see this brew as standing alone from the others. It is nothing like the others as a matter of fact...and it's unique flavors and characteristics, while not as pronounced or "in your face" as your typical IPA manages to blend into an extremely well crafted beer!","HarryPotHead","Apr 08, 2013"
