4.31,6.2,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"O: This is an excellent IPA. Sculpin is the darling at the Ballast Point ball, but Big Eye is the underrated hot girl that doesn't get enough press. This beer would be the flagship at 90% of the breweries out there. Well done Ballast Point!","MemphisSooner","Yesterday at 12:11 PM"
3.96,-2.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"As others have said, it's earthier than the Sculpin. It's also slightly drier with a heavier emphasis on the piney hops rather than the citrusy ones. Malts are present but I'd say the hood balance out nicely. Great springtime brew for when you aren't ready for the citrusy, fresh IPA's but still want some of those same crisp qualities. Overall: very nice.","kgammell1","Yesterday at 10:43 AM"

I'm starting to see what some of the hype is about, and the reason Ballast Point is priced the way it is. I've noticed many people mention India Pale Ale was an acquired taste for them, but for me, It was love at first taste. Haha, But really, I enjoyed IPA from the start, my first IPA being the "Hopsecutioner" by Terrapin.

Oddly, since I am on the East coast, I usually get these in cans or bottles and I do prefer the Sculpin in comparative tastes.  I have once tasted them at the Ballast Point pub in Little Italy in SD, and the gap was much closer so freshness probably counts for a lot.

4.48,10.3,4,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"BOD 241/14.  Pours a very slightly hazy medium amber with a light dark ruby cast.  As it warms, the chill haze disappears.  Above average head volume and retention, world class lacing.  Outstanding nose of sweet tropicals (pineapple, mango and tangerine) over caramel with a peppery note.  Light medium body with a nice smooth texture that approaches slick.  Well carbonated with a effervescent rush from the middle to the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense, very well balanced and complex in terms of hop flavor. It begins with a burst of blended hop flavor that separates into the tropical components as it fades into a caramel sweetness.  Interestingly, a grapefruit rind flavor is also noted as it flows into the mild bitterness of the middle coupled with a pepper note.  The finish is a slow fade from residual caramel sweetness into a rind like mild lingering bitterness.","tillmac62","Dec 03, 2014"

Any other brewer would be happy to have a citrus-forward IPA like Sculipin or pine-forward IPA like Big Eye in their portfolio. I'll definitely have to try this one out of cans sometime.","LambicPentameter","Oct 26, 2014"

4.21,3.7,3.75,4.5,4.25,3.5,4.25,"Pours a deep amber color with a big, light brown foamy head that stays for a bit and results in some similarly foamy lacing. Pretty good retention. Lots of citrus in this one. Grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. A bit of pine resin. Some very light caramel and bready/grain malts as well. The first thing noticed with the taste is the bitterness, which pairs excellently with the grapefruit aroma an taste. Some lemon zest and sour orange give this one a very unique taste. The pine isn't as present now; it's still there but the flavors allow the citrus to dominate. Not as hop heavy as I expected. Overall the taste isn't overpowering but it is very well done. The only negative thing I have to say about this beer is that, in my opinion, it is a bit overcarbonated. It could've benefitted from a bit less. Sticks to the tongue a bit and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Overall a very good, easy drinking IPA suitable for any occasion. A good alternative if you're not in the mood to get knocked over by Sculpin!","majorbase2","Oct 14, 2014"

Took a long time to settle and laced nicely. Aroma was very nice, grapefruit up front, pine tropical fruit and bready malt in the background. The flavor of this beer was excellent, with that grapefruit dominant, also some mango, resin and slight biscuit flavors. The mouthfeel was great, the hops coating the palate nicely and the carbonation set it off nicely. Very nice beer, wish we could get BP beers all the time in CO.","timontheroad","Sep 22, 2014"

Not as brightly scented and flavored as Sculpin in my opinion, but where it is not quite as potent with tropical elements, it has a wonderfully fresh flavor with crisp citrus notes to ripen it up.

Good one inch plus head that last a minute or two and leave nice lacing. Aroma is very noticeable: some fruit hints. Mouthfeel is very good, carbonation is spot on. No bitter hop bite or aftertaste. Taste is a good balance, the hops and grains are well balanced with the malt. Malt is present and gives a nice yin to the yang of the hops. This is a good one, the alc content is a little strong, but can't be tasted. They did well, and I would have this one again and recommend it.","Curtis","Aug 08, 2014"

Nice spicy, fruity hop aromas.Slighly toffee like malts. Taste is better than the aroma, thick caramel/toffee malt flavours vie with nice spicy/piney hops..nice. Nice mouth feel also its quite heavy for style but its very inviting on the tongue and the long lasting hop after taste is welcome. Very nice IPA.

4.45,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured a gorgeous clear amber with a one finger fluffy white head that stuck around. Quite the nice looking IPA. Scents of grapefruit, citrus zest, especially orange, tropical fruit, with notes of pineapple and mango and heavy hits of orange juice. An excellent, fruity, citrusy, West Coast IPA aroma. Flavor begins like a classic West Coast IPA, with big notes of citrus pith, grapefruit peel and hints of pine resin. In the middle the flavor picks up further notes of bitter citrus pith and pine resin, with slight floral notes appearing. The finish has a nice flavor of orange pith, grapefruit peel and pith, floral hop character and pine resin. A slight hint of alcohol is discernible throughout the sip. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, grapefruit pith and peel and orange pith and peel. A good West Coast IPA flavor, with all the flavors expected from the style. Very nice, though maybe not as flavorful as Sculpin. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a resinous, semi-drying feel. Good, easily drinkable and quite true to style. Overall this is another excellent IPA from Ballast Point that is a bit lighter, yet still aromatic and flavorful, alternative to Sculpin. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Jun 20, 2014"

3.91,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a beautiful copper color matched by few beers. The aroma is something I had difficulties with; it smells like a standard American IPA, if that makes sense. No overt fruit aromas. The taste is pretty solid. The hop flavor is not terribly complex, consisting mostly of pine bitterness, with a hint of grapefruit. Of course, the lack of complexity is far from a bad thing. It has a nice malt balance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this is a solid brew. I still think Ballast Point's Sculpin is a better IPA, but at about 4 bucks less a 6-pack than Sculpin, I think I'd prefer to pick this brew up instead.","thomda11","Jun 17, 2014"

There is a small off white head that leaves nice film and substantial lacing. The aroma pleasantly hoppy with lots of pine, grapefruit, and grass aromas. Slight malt backbone balances the beer out well. The mouthfeel is sticky but almost a bit too light in my opinion. The flavor is quite hoppy and bitter for the style. Almost seemed more dipa. This is good though, if it was in my market it could easily become my go to ipa.","lochef81","Jun 16, 2014"

3.88,-4.4,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"This pours a bright amber gold with a tall and frothy head. The aroma is fundamentally grassy hops, with some citrus notes. Taste is a nice mix of sweet malt with bitterness that's not nearly as high as many IPAs these days, but there's a load of citrus hop flavor, making it quite tasty. Yeast gives a little bit of fruitiness. Soft bodied, and not too carbonated. A good quaffing IPA.","allengarvin","Jun 10, 2014"

4.26,4.9,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured from can into pint glass. 1” head that gradually recedes to a foamy 1/4” layer with clouds of sticky lacing. Deep, clear orange/copper color. Smells of sharp piney resin, brown sugar and floral notes. Taste follows the nose, with bitter hops, sugary malt and a bit more floral presence. The hops stick around on the palate after each sip. Medium-to-full-bodied, creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a solid West Coast IPA with starring roles for Centennial and Columbus hops.","xungmound98","Apr 03, 2014"

2.9,-28.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"So I was on a Ballast Point quest this weekend. I had Bigeye first, then tried the over-hyped Sculpin. But lets touch on the Bigeye. I don't really care what my beer looks like, it's all about the taste. And this ale is VERY average, kind of bland, and forgettable. Much like Sculpin, the bitter aftertaste is extremely off-putting. In fact, the bitterness of this offering over-powers any other taste. If somebody offered me this beer, I'd drink it, but would never go out of my way to buy it again. I've been completely disapointed with Ballast Point - there's so much hype - but so little to take from the ales. Other than bitter and hard to drink. A craft brew should be exceptional - to be honest a larger brewery like Sierra Nevada has offerings that blow this away. (think Torpedo). Not to mention a top end crafter. Do't go out of your way to try this one.","sobuf","Mar 15, 2014"

It fits the mid-sized range for beer drinkers very well, and clocks in at an affordable price and is usually not too hard to find. Its best lumped into the category I place "go too" beers. X2IPA, Maxamus, GI harvest ale, etc. All are good hoppy brews of different calibers that you can enjoy anything...and yea. You can enjoy this anytime. I highly recommend it. 4.25","jucifer1818","Feb 05, 2014"

Mouth banged by a ballanced hop bomb, mellowed in a herbal oil spill. Great carbonation keep the flavors pumping. Orange and lemon, lime, grape fruit. The finish a huge chorus of MORE!!!

However, this baby would stand out for its emphasis on bitterness and on different levels of hops. It's almost as if they decided to just go hop crazy and make an IPA and then dry-hop the heck out of it as well. Highly recommended for fans of the style. You will be hard-pressed to find an IPA so distinctive.","BeerDocT","Dec 15, 2013"
3.91,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Moving the hops towards later addition would better match the style, or perhaps a bit more malt sweetness of of a DIPA for the hops, but this bitter representation of a west coast IPA is quite satisfying, as long as you live at the far end of Vinnie's "Lupluin shift". Overall, given my own penchant for hoppy beer, I enjoyed this one; it provides an honorable analog to a peaty Islay scotch, which similarly delivers enjoyment to a few, dedicated aficionados.","heartofgold","Dec 15, 2013"

Great lacing marks every sip you take. The aroma is mildly hoppy and citrus fruits like grapefruit, lemon and orange zest come through. Light and crisp when it first hits your tongue, this IPA is slightly bitter at first and then warms up your mouth as the hops become more present. The hops are very well handled and are the main point through this beer, the alcohol is barely detected even in its aftertaste.

4.02,-1,4.25,4,4,4,4,"a really good ipa, but after sculpin, ballast point cant really top it. this is by all means a great beer, and uniquely hopped with shades of pine and a great punchy bitterness, but it pales in comparison to sculpin, which is one of the finest crafted anywhere. red malts balance this out a little better, and its got a beautiful red glow to it beneath a white foamy head with excellent retention. pine is the hops family, but not as aggressive as some, this is more of a session beer to me, although it does pack a bit of an alcohol punch after a few. I had this at blue tuck in Syracuse amongst several other great india pales, and it stood up well to all of them. carbonation is excellent and this is a well made brew overall, but its nothing compared to a sculpin.","StonedTrippin","Sep 06, 2013"

Big Eye features an amazing nose of herbal, piney, slightly earthy hops; slight currant and blackberry at the end. Light copper color with a fluffy white head that dissapates into an intricate web of lacing around the glass. Nice carbonic bite with a medium body. Flavor is ALL herbal/piney/earthy hop taste. No sweetness, very little citrus to be found. Malt body is very much in the background; lightly biscuity and bready. Hard to take any real notes in flavor other than the pungent hop overload. This is definitely for hop heads. Sculpin IPA seems to be a little less dank in terms of pungency, I prefer it to Big Eye.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 16, 2013"

Ballast Point has created in Big Eye a slightly less balanced India Pale Ale, and I mean that in a good way. This is a dry, grapefruity, piney beast that keeps the alcohol level low enough to make this a good beer to drink multiples of. This is one hell of an IPA, and you'll love it with some blue cheese, steak, or fajitas.","hagbergl","Jul 11, 2013"

Smell is fruity tropical hops, getting pineapple and citrus, with some herbal notes as well, and some crackery malt. Taste is crackery/buttery malt, bitter and slightly fruity hops.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset brass topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, pine needle, and very light menthol. The taste brings in more of the same, without the menthol character and with a hint of lightly-spicy greens. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice enough IPA, nothing to exclaim about, but nothing offensive, either.","TMoney2591","May 30, 2013"

4.22,3.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4,"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the massive aroma. This was inclusive of the hearty grain bill, phenols, and booze, but left plenty of room for the hops to come in and balance in full force. This gave a high level of complexity, but with refreshing crispness and cleanliness in the end. The flavoring followed nicely, giving an equally as complex flavoring that fought between juiciness and dryness as it rode down the gullet. Sometimes the bitterness muddles the cleanliness of flavoring, as it sticks true to the west coast style, but the ultimate blend makes for a tasty, reliable, reproducible experience of intrigue.","TheBrewo","Mar 12, 2013"

Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruit), along with some bready malt. It tastes mostly like citrusy and pine hops, and a bit of bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little coating with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good IPA, it's definitely worth trying!","bluejacket74","Jan 18, 2013"

Usually, diacetyl is a fermentation byproduct (not enough yeast pitched, or the beer removed from the yeast too soon).

Will have to try again, maybe on tap if possible, to see if the fresher version has more aroma.

Some sweet malt gives life to the dried fruit flavors of the hops. Ends semi-flowery with a nice underlying yet balancing bitterness. Really really good. This IPA takes the classic west coast flavors of an American IPA while presenting them in a subtle and super drinkable english-style. Unique, amazingly balance, super flavorful, and dangerously chuggable. That's what makes a damn good beer.","jtierney89","Oct 10, 2012"

4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating(got it recently from Ohio though, so we should be ok). Pours a lightly cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, herbal, floral, pine, grass, orange, mango, pineapple, honey, caramel, citrus rind, and bread. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; slightly more herbal and piney than I am used to as well. Taste of big grapefruit, herbal, pine, floral, grass, mango, citrus rind, pineapple, caramel, honey, and bread. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, herbal, pine, tropical, honey, caramel, and bread on the finish for a good bit. Very nice malt/bitterness balance in this; with a nice balance and complexity of hop flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming at all noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPA. A bit more malty than your typical West coast IPA, but I am not complaining. Great hop flavor balance, and very smooth to drink. Great stuff.","superspak","Jun 24, 2012"

A dark shade of amber with a pencil thin head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass as it is being drunk. The smell is nothing too special, but I am sure age played a part in that. Very little citrus, a fair amount of pine, some herbal notes and carmel on the nose. The taste follows the nose but finishes quite a bit more bitter and dry than I expected. Drinks very well. Sculpin takes the cake as far as a citrus forward IPA, but this is a very well balanced IPA and has a great finish. Another solid offering from Ballast Point.","PerHops","Jan 23, 2012"

Sharp pine and floral hops have joined the citrus but again, the balance keeps this from being a hopsickle. Maybe a touch of honey along with the bread and grainy malt flavors. At 7% this isn't something you would pound it large quantities but it is tasty and different enough from your garden variety pale ale. I would definitely have this again, and would love to try it on tap as well.","daliandragon","Jan 21, 2012"

4.23,4.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4," The taste of this IPA is very citrus yet there are other elements that come off as herbal/floral without much in the way of vegetal, just a mild amount of hop spiciness. The citrus starts grapefruity but seems to hit the lemony side and verges toward orange rind zest in the middle when the malt sweetness is a little more noticeable. The flavor lasts well after the swallow with a mild peppery quality which blends well with the mild alcohol which seems to add a dry quality to the overall flavor, very juicy throughout and the flavor really rocks, I find the bitterness to be very smooth. Overall you can't find many better IPA's in the west coast style. This is a solid beer through and through. I don't think there can be much in the way of improving this I put it pretty close to the top.","Slatetank","Nov 27, 2011"

A large amount of citrus and pine comes through in the floral bouquet. The flavors, impeccably balanced, weave a blend of soft caramel malt, citrus and rind zest, some grapefruit and moderately peppering bitters. The finish lasts nicely, bringing back grapefruit and zest, closing with lingering pine resin. Everything about this brew is refreshing and clean. The mouthfeel is crisp and quaffable, with well-integrated carbonation levels. Very fine example of the style, and I’m so glad I picked up a case to enjoy for some time to come.

4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark gold/amber color without much head but with delicately clinging brussels lace. Aroma is hoppy with all those subtle notes you expect from a west coast IPA. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more noticeable in the nose as well as in the mouth. Taste-wise this is another very balanced beer from BP, one that's quite hoppy but not overblown into bitter nothingness..the malt is in there and you can taste it. Medium-thin mouthfeel and low to moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Not exactly a lightweight summer brew but a classic american IPA that's perhaps a step down from Sculpin...particularly in the aromatics department..not as much of that delightful citrus flavor here. Still, excellent.","tobelerone","Jul 08, 2011"

Hops are a bit sweaty and a bit piny, but nicely balanced out with malts giving an even rounded sweetness. There was a good malt balance and nice sweetness.

The nose was hoppy and sweet, with green characteristics like fresh-cut grass. The flavors are peppery-hops initially, with flowery sweet follow-up to balance. The beer is crisp and light-bodied, with an increased carbonation to help carry the flavors. The aftertaste is once again spicy-hopped and slightly bitter. The finish is a little rough, as the downside to increased carbonation rears its ugly head. The beer is good, but the finish makes it a tougher drink than some other IPAs I've had.

Pretty thick texture, juicy and chewy, very nice. I'm sensing a dominance of finishing hops in this beer. I'm getting a mix of peaches and oranges. It's not so much bitter as it is flavorful.

Large bands on the glass are left behind and big, rocky islands all over the place. The aroma burst from the bottle as soon as I opened it and waves of pine-forward resin flushed my olfactory organ. Closer inspection yielded a fainter grapefruit. Once the pour was complete, the aroma was much less pronounced. This is not to say, however, that the flavor is in any way compromised. There's a lot going on here. The sip starts with caramel and biscuits, which provide a nice, sweet background for the well-balanced pine and citrus. This is almost like chewing a grapefruit rind, then switching it out to suck on a pine cone! Resiny with an herbal and bitter finish complemented by a slightest hint of spice from the alcohol, but not harsh at all. Texture is quite smooth and a fairly big body. The carbonation could stand to be a touch more pronounced, but works in a "sipper" setting. I tip the balance over to being more dry than sweet, but still towards the middle. Quite a delightful beer in which to imbibe. I'm glad I bought a 6 pack of this.","DmanGTR","Jan 11, 2011"

The brew has a perfect carbonation level that helps push the great hops citrus and fruity flavors threw. It is not an intense flavor out of control, but restrained.

Orange pith with a bit of grapefruit. More like fresh oranges then sweet orange juice. Fairly one dimensional. The flavor is very similar. Very orangey, a bit of tangerine and pith.

Lacing was not heavy but present 'til the last sip. Nose was pine and citrus (lemon, grapefruit, orange). Taste was apricots, citrus (grapefruit, lemons, oranges), and caramel. You can notice the alcohol, but it is not unpleasant. This is a nicely balanced IPA for sure. Mouthfeel was medium, a bit oily but with a clean, dry, and mildly bitter hop bite in the finish.

The malt bill offers up as complex array of flavors including caramel, bisquit, and pale malt tastes. The hop character is good. It has a massively bitter, citrus hop taste that hits you up front and carries on through to the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

Big citrus hop aroma, strong on the grapefruit, it also has a fresh buddy hop aroma as well. Not much malt big up due to the strong hop presence. Grapefruit flavors start things off, followed by tropical fruit notes, mainly pineapple. A bit of pine in the end. There is a sweet candied honey undercurrent that goes along with a bready malt. Overall big beer for the style. The feel is quite thick with soft carbonation so it feels heavier than it actually is. It is quite sweet but is overcome with the hoppy bitterness.

4.17,2.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"My hesitancy is dispelled by the aroma - this has an effervescent candy-malted smell with sharp hop highlights. It's not a slug in the face, but a very refined aroma that hints at the complexity to come. The taste is satisfyingly rich. It isn't the hoppiest IPA, despite the "intense" claims on the (beautifully designed) label. The perfectly judged carbonation lets solid, buttery malt rest on your tongue, while the hops claw their way through the roof of your mouth and into your brain. This pint reminds me of a well produced electronica track - each element is isolated in the mix and presented with clarity - you can literally decide which taste to focus on explore it apart from the others. Behind the main flavours, a salty tang drones. The finish is just right, malts and hops subside at an equal rate so that the beer just fades away, Keyser Soze style "and like that...he's gone"","pnkHoody","Feb 15, 2010"

The mango becomes more prominent as it breathes, and it's uncannily awesome. The flavor carries over many of the floral hoppy qualities and sits them over a simple, yet very clean malt sweetness. On the sweeter, maltier side, but not sugary and sticky like some sweeter IPAs can get. Finishes with a firm but integrated bitterness that is well rounded with the other flavors, leaving a lingering mango-grapefruit taste on the tongue. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation.

The malts don't really stand up, and citrusy flavors from the hops don't really pop. This medium bodied beer has an oily mouthfeel, and is easy to drink.

The taste follows the smell, but is considerably more balanced. While this is certainly a hoppy beer, the malt is right there neck and neck with the hops.

It starts with a great malt character thats not too malty or light, then hop flavor starts off as the malt fades and then finishes with a nice bitterness. It is a little too sweet if anything, but being 7% alc and hiding it well also helps. Not being overly bitter or hopped and not too high on the alcohol makes this a more likely candidate for drinking regularly than most big time IPAs. I like to reach for this when I just want a nice bitter and slightly malty IPA without breaking the bank, my tongue/taste buds, or my liver.","jlindros","Sep 27, 2009"

Thankfully Ballast steps up when needed. The beer is chill hazed, light copper colored, with a thin foam that laces in thin rings. The aroma is well balanced between malts and hops, more than I'd like as a hophead. Kind of a light citrus style of hops, lemon and orange more than grapefruit, very nice. The taste is sweet to begin with, it seems to me that the sweetness comes from malts but still is appreciated. Delicious hops citrus flavors in the middle and a mild bitterness in the aftertaste. I'd say that the aftertaste leaves a lot of flavors, a little pine resin and toffee, again a strong balance of malts and hops. I found the body to be mildly carbonated, giving a soft mouthfeel that matches IPA's well. Overall well done, maybe a little too balanced but it could be that the hops faded with time or something.

Loads of citrus fruits, too, as well as some yeasty esters of mango and pineapple. A crisp, caramel malt backbone balances perfectly with the hoppiness. Mouthfeel is phenomenal, with a spot-on carbonation level that gives the semi-chewy, medium body some pep to the finish.

Nose reveals some malt and piny hops. Taste was bitter and resinous with a medicinal finish; however, there's also a hint of citrus and a malty/biscuity quality that seems to form the backbone. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied; carbonation is really prickly throughout, with a slight, residual oiliness that coats the tongue.

Big Eye and Sculpin are easily two of the most citrus intense IPAs that have ever crossed this palate. Big Eye is good, but Sculpin is far superior.

On the other hand, the hops are extremely bittering, acerbic and tart, slighly grapefruity, but they linger way too far in to the aftertaste. The beer does look good with a lightish clear coppery color with a decent white head, some lacing and retention. The nose on the beer is nice pungent estery and oily hop, with some florals hidden underneath. The taste of the beer doesn't bring out the hoppy florals nearly enough, but more like the bittering ends of the fruit. The beer is medium bodied, decently carbonated, and the plus, the big plus is the nice balance with the bready malts in the mid section. Not my favorite IPA by a long shot. The 7% ABV is well hidden. The hops will clear out the palate but will linger longer than is warranted.","albern","Feb 15, 2009"

Hoppy nose with sour lemon and orange citrus zest, wheat, straw, tea leaf, some biscuit or barley, minimal caramel or toffee, pinch of cherry fruit, the nose actually shows a good deal of restraint and tactful length. Full-bodied, not overly dense but together the high level of carbonation plus its overall dryness increase its mouth presence a lot. Lemon, white grapefruit citrus adds more tartness. Here, though, the tea and tobacco leaf aspects sweeter. Touch of molasses helps add balance. Biscuity, bready ending, especially as it warms.

The smell is packed full citrus fruits with notes of oranges, tangerines, and lemon peel. There is some slight caramel notes coming out of the malt as well, but not well pronounced. I don't think I am giving the nose justice there, but this is complex and wonderful nose on this IPA. The scents leads right into the flavor profile with the bitter hops upfront flooding with flavors of grapefruit, pine needles, lemon zest, and finally the caramel soaked bready malt comes out in the finish. The flavors meld very well together and create a unique and balanced IPA for a hop-lover. I would think a non IPA drinker would find this offering quite harsh though, but not me. The mouthfeel has plenty of carbonation for this medium bodied beer that leaves no detectable alcohol in the finish. The drinkability for a hop lover is excellent and would also be quite session able at only six percent.","TheodorHerzl","Jul 30, 2008"

Flavor is strong bitter hops up front balanced out by citrus and some malt in the middle and leaving a definate pine resin in the end with just a touch of alcohol to warm the throat. Bitterness lingers. In the mouth the tongue is coated with the pine resin which takes away slightly from drinkability for me but for west coast IPA lovers this would be plus.

Not impressed with this move but will check back once more to seek some validation. 3/31/10 confirms with a decreased feel as well, bit too watery. Nose is more malt than hops.

On the palate, brisk bitterness from the get-go, which grows in intensity through the middle and into the finish, which has significant length. Aside from hop bitterness, you get some herbal notes that are hop derived and more than a little sweetness from the malts and alcohol. Mouthfeel is definitely rough around the edges, but it's also got some nice malt smoothness and, in a nice change for the style, not too much carbonation.

Lots of citrus present; lemons, oranges, grapefruit and pineapple all come to mind, also some grassy pine. The taste is a floral bouquet of hops, balanced nicely with a biscuity, slightly toasted malts. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky smooth carbonation.

There is a dryness to the flavor also, as well as a somewhat biscuity taste. An interesting mouthfeel. It isnt silky, and Im not quite sure that I can put my finger on it.

Starts off very smooth on the tongue with a pale malt then quickly the hops take over and leave the mouth feeling very dry from the bitter citrus hop flavors.

Notes of candied orange peel are dominant up front, but a gripping, solid bitterness soon takes hole and lingers on in the finish. Towards the end of a sip a herbal note similar to mint, or perhaps menthol would be a better descriptor, starts to become noticeable. A certain resinous, almost pine-like note also is found lingering on in the finish. There is a touch of malt here as well, perhaps some caramel, and something like toffee; these notes though only serve to accentuate the citrus components of the hop character. This is a nice beer, easy drinking, though it perhaps has a bit too much astringent, herbal bitterness to be truly quaffable.

It had a wonderful head that would not give up with great lacing. The bubbles were medium sized. The color is gold/copper and it was very clear. The flavor is very bitter and resiny but there is some malt seetness for the hops to hold on to. I did not get much yeast flavor contribution. I was slightly surprised by the finish b/c I expected a crazy hoppy dry mouth but it was pleasant. Don't get me wrong, when I burped later I could still taste it and was happy for that. To me a sign of a good American IPA is that the belch later reminds you of the beer. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium CO2, a little CO2 bite, med body and a slight alcohol warmth. I found this beer very drinkable and a great way to showcase Centennial hops. (one of my favorite hops!) As a critique I would suggest using some other hops to give a more complex flavor. However since this IPA comes from San Diego, where IPAs seem to rule it cool that they decided to keep it simple and even put it on the label that it's all one type of hops.","beersabound","Feb 28, 2006"

The taste was incredible. i could really taste the hops, yet it wasnt rough... hoppy and flavorful. I had a what seemed to be a rather carbonated bottle which gave me a nice sensation in my mouth.

Taste starts off with big hops as well. Juicy pineapple and grapefruit right out of the gate. Acidic and bitter pin pricks all over my tongue. Nice hop flavor. Near the finish, the toffee/sugary biscuit malt body show up, but can't stand up to the hop onslaught. Finish is bitter with traces of sugary malt. Big, lively feel to this one.

4.27,5.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A hazy golden-orange rests beneath a creamy white head that holds quite well and leaves lots of thin, splashy lace at the outset. Limited amounts of tiny bubbles can be seen streaming to the surface through a thick, proteinaceous haze, helping to maintain its creamy white lid. The malty/fruity/piney/floral/citrusy nose is rather interesting with a combination of sweet, lightly caramel-drizzled dough; apricots; citrus rind; wild flowers; dull pine; wet earth; and dried leaves. It's quite unique, and is even reminiscent of bourbon in a way. It's gently crisp on the tongue before warming to become just slightly creamy with a medium-full body and very fine, natural carbonation (it's bottle conditioned). In the flavor, fruit appears and vanishes quickly, followed by piney hops atop a toasty, caramel-drizzled malt base. It's well-balanced by a solid bitterness, and it finishes drying with some more of its floral and citrus-rind flavors amidst a lightly sticky malt.","NeroFiddled","Apr 23, 2004"

Nose has a mild hop floral spiciness at the front with a sweet malt middles, the back is fresh and crisp, and start is ambrosial with a nice malt presence, which leads us to the middling top. Finish is benevolent in its acidity; the hops survigrous in their spicy bite, droughty aftertaste continues the spicy floral bite from the hops, a quaffable brew, and a palate pleaser.
