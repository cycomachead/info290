Things start off with a light malt and grain flavor upfront. Taste turns almost seltzer-like midway. Hops are very light toward the finish. Overall this is a pretty bland and uninviting finish.

I really liked the color but the lack of head and lacing is disappointing. Aroma is weak but caramelly and toasty. A fruity sweetness begins the taste with apple notes. Caramel sugars come in next and then a more sour flavor follows. Hops seem to be there but too weak and I can't really discern a flavor. A little soapy in the mouth too. Finish is medicinal and kills what may have been good from this beer. Starts out decent but goes down from there. Also, the pamphlet that came with this said it was a steam beer which is a joke. I should mark it much lower if the brewers were trying to make a steam beer out of this. But I'll keep the ratings as is for it being an amber.","granger10","0"

The caramel malt is a bit more prevalent and hte grainey quality is more subdued, but not all that bad. The feel is a touch light for me, wih a rather hearty carbonation. Overall, this is rather plain. The flavors could use a little hop to back it up. I would like a bit more body as well.
