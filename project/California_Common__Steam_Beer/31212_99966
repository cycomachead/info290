The finish is clean, dry.  This is good, but nothing amazing.  Standard, unoffensive, but forgettable.","nmann08","Aug 25, 2014"

3.34,-4.6,3.5,3.25,3.5,2.5,3.5,"On draft at the Brixton. The appearance is a very cloudy amber color, with light foam. Smelling, I find little to no aroma. The flavor is surprisingly wheat-like, something like a wheat/lager hybrid. It's definitely an easy drinker but something about the flavor did not make me want more than one. I haven't had a anchor steam in a while so I can't compare.","gabrielsyme","Apr 24, 2014"

Refreshing with a dry finish. Light in body with zesty carbonation. A decent beer. I enjoyed my pint.","Huhzubendah","Nov 25, 2013"

4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Bright and clear with a nice white head, pale gold in color. A bit of spice hop in the aroma (Saaz hops). Fairly clean flavor profile with a bit of hop flavor, and definitely fairly assertive with the hop bitterness. Dries out a bit in the finish and definitely invites another swallow. Overall nicely done and incredibly drinkable. Kicking myself for not grabbing a growler of it when I visited today.","mpyle","0"
