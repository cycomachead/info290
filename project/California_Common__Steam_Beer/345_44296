3.8,0.5,3.25,3.75,3.75,4,4," The flavor is good with a gentle malt flavor which has a light toasted flavor which accents the piney herbal flavors from the hops well with a mild caramel element that balances some of the bitterness and yeast is dry without much fruitiness overall just compliments the hop and malt. Overall a very quaffable balanced beer in the steam style It kind of strikes me as a hoppy alt or German IPA if you will, a little more bitter than most but still very drinkable.","Slatetank","Mar 21, 2013"

3.92,3.7,4,3.25,4.25,4,4,"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the solid balance through the flavoring. The malts showed nice depth, even sweetness, and just the right about of hearty metallic bite. This last component is where a lot of beers in the style tend to go overboard, but the result here was pure crispness and cleanliness. Thus, this beer stays true to style, and keeps things fresh and inviting from start to finish.","TheBrewo","Feb 19, 2013"

3.79,0.3,4,3.75,4,3.5,3.5,"The taste is more balanced than the smell, meaning a bit more hop bite. On the malt side is a touch of fruitiness that I didn't detect in t he smell (blackberry?). The hop is non-descript, but provides some bitterness, particularly in the aftertaste. The earthiness remains the predominant impression. The body and carbonation are predictably average in each case.","smcolw","Jan 25, 2013"
3.4,-10.1,4,2.75,3.5,4,3.5,"O-it's a milder steam beer. It's drinkable without much to complain about. Definitely more mellow than say an anchor steam. More or less, tastes like a mild red ale really. Not really spectacular","AdamBear","Jan 24, 2013"

4.25,12.4,4,4,4,4.5,5,"overall I really dug, it havent had to many of this style, my friend had a sip of mine and he said it was def better that anchor steam... I like anchor steam , but I think im going to agree with him","gdfan47","Sep 24, 2008"
3.63,-4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a clear amber with thin eggshell colored head. Good retention left nice lacing wisps. Smells of fruit, floral hops, grainy malt, and citrus. Tastes of grains, honey, light bread, pineapple, lemon, and a touch of earthy hops. Medium light in body, good carbonation. Smooth and lightly malty with a crisp bitter finish. A good California Common, refreshing and easy to drink, quite sessionable, but with so much other stuff on tap at Victory, it's hard to want to stick with this one.","HopDerek","Sep 24, 2008"
3.65,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"In the end, this is a very drinkable beer and was an excellent representation of the California Common/Steam Beer style. If it's on-tap anywhere in your area, then I suggest you give this Victory beer a try.","AltBock","Sep 14, 2008"
4.45,17.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: the is a killer session beer that you can drink all day long and not get bored with it. Too bad this is a one-off beer.","Gavage","Aug 23, 2008"

4.03,6.6,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"D - I was surprised to see a Steam Beer on the menu at Victory. Their take on the California Common is solid with lots of flavors gelling together and producing a very tasty brew that is highly drinkable.","ffejherb","0"
