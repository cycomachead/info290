3.63,4.6,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5," The flavor starts peppery and herbal from the hops which bring out a sort of earthy complimentary malt element with lager-like yeast flavors bringin some mineral elements along with toastiness in the malt and a light almond-like nutty sweetness with a subtle caramel or vienna flavor which compliments the yeast and adds a bit of depth. Overall I would not say this is the best example of the style, but it is better than average in most regards including drinkability...I would try this on draft.","Slatetank","May 18, 2014"

Smells like bread, fruity mango or peach maybe no hops really. The taste very much a bread craker taste, not really tasting the fruit I smell. There are no hops just a slight bitterness and not to sweet. Mouthfeel is medium, it has body just not really flavor to match.

It is a cool day and there is little to no humidity and the lack of head retention was surprising. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity and if there was a way to cash it in at my local recycling center, I would be on my way there now. I had a babe of a g/f in the early 1990's and her hair was both copper-colored and coarse as wire. I wonder if she braids it up and sells it as scrap? Man, what a beauty! Both the g/f and the beer. Nose was solidly malty with a slightly minty/grassy scent underneath. I was vaguely reminded of Girl Scout mint cookies. Taste was semi-sweet and quite tasty. It occurred to me, in writing this review, that I have never reviewed Anchor Steam, despite it being one of the first micros I ever put up to my lips, I wonder how the two will compare. This was worthwhile.","woodychandler","May 23, 2013"

Smell is of malt, biscuit, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a distinct grass forward aroma and flavor.","UCLABrewN84","May 12, 2013"

The nose comprises flowers, light wheat, a touch of funky wheat, and a light dusting of powdered sugar. The taste holds notes of mild biscuit, greens, light grass, flowers, and a twinge of nougat (yeah, I'm not sure where that came from, either). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.

Beer isn't bad but I just found it bland (boring) and a little toned down for the masses. There is a good hop presence but it's more of just some minor earthy, piney hops that have a little citric to them and help give off an easy, crisp and dry finish. Not much else going on as some fruit and sweet notes are muted and the beer isn't watery but definitely a thinner body helps you pound it.","clayrock81","Mar 16, 2013"

At first I thought there wasn't enough hop to balance out the flavor but I changed my mind. Though not ad hoppy as some of my more usual beers, it is actually quite balanced. It would make a good session beer. It's a tasty beer but its missing something to really make it pop.","constantine_272","Mar 08, 2013"

3.78,8.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"a style of beer id like to see come around a little more, this is a great spring seasonal with all the necessary attributes. it pours an amber to copper color, clean and neat, with an inch of lasting white head. the nose is pretty well hopped, a little citrusy, with a fairly big malt profile for such a light and crisp beer. there isn't rye in this, but is has a certain spice element to the smell as well. the flavor is really well balanced. plenty of grain happening, some caramel sweetness, a little tannic thing going on, and a good size body. the hops are exclusively in the finish, hardly bitter at all, but of a neutral fruity feel to them, good compliment to the bigger malt flavors. the finish is super crisp and refreshing, and this is an easy beer to drink quite a few of. I like it in early spring here because its got the clean satisfying drinkability and summery hop complexion, but it also has enough body to be useful when its still cold out. a well made example of a style that I am finding I really enjoy.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

3.78,8.9,4.5,3.25,4,3.75,3.75,"It's been a while since I've had a steam beer. Columbia Common is a beautiful beer, it pours out a brilliant copper color capped with a lovely head. The aroma is a little weak and what's there of the toasted malts is a bit. It ticks the flavor marks just right though, with that whole "not a lager, not yet an ale" thing going on, with a wonderful slight malty nuttiness. A bit of hops hang out with a grainy finish. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is solid. A solid attempt at a under-brewed style.","shand","Feb 21, 2013"

From the 12 oz bottle bought at Sprout's Market in San Diego. I've got five more bottles from the sixer, so this will probably end up at DIPA Helper.","mactrail","Feb 09, 2013"
3.25,-6.3,3.75,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"This is a disappointing beer. The nose offers very little. The flavor follows. There isn't much here. It's a simple, subtle flavor profile. The mouthfeel is also a bit thin. This just isn't for me. I need something a little more bold and flavorful.","tdm168","Feb 05, 2013"
