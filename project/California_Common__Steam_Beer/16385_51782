4.5,16.6,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"This pours a bright golden straw color with great foaming. I get notes of toasted corn, cereal, and a fresh cut grassy aroma. It’s fresh and vibrant and that continues on the flavor with a sharply focused lemony bitterness. There’s a strong grassy note which runs through, along with lemony citrus and some lemongrass as well, more of an earthy vs. fruity hop profile, and it ends with a dry finish. While it is not one I would rate as accurate to the style it is a tasty brew indeed.","elNopalero","Oct 27, 2012"

3.65,-5.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy orange-golden with a soapy white head. Asymmetrical lacing around the edges as the head dissipates. Some green grape and unripe banana. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel with very little carbonation. Clean flavor with some tart fruit that gets accentuated by the hop character at the finish.","DocJitsu","Aug 20, 2012"

4.15,7.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Anyone who knows me knows I'm a big fan of this style and this brewery and this offering is no exception. I really enjoy how the ante is upped (for the style) on the hops but in an herbal and grassy way and not in a C-hop, citrusy, American IPA type way. If you'll excuse me I'm off to get another pour. Highly recommended both on cask and on draft.","berkey","Aug 10, 2009"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this on-tap at The Trappist in Oakland. I've listed this as year-round as it seems to be one of their staple beers. Pretty nice beer of a style that is rarely done. Good job with this one- I look forward to seeing more from this brewery. 33cl pour for $5. Pours a hazy darker golden with a head that fades fairly quickly. In the nose there is lots of graininess, and quite a lot of bitter, earthy hops as well. Personally I think the two work well together here. Tastes very interesting. The typical yeastiness of the California Common runs throughout, with a good deal of grassy and herbal flavors as top notes. Lots of grain, grass, and earthy hops on the finish. Quite substantial in flavor for the style, but then again the style is so rarely made and somewhat loosly defined, so lets just say this is a flavorful contribution to the style. Smooth, and thicker than other California Commons I've had. Really quite nice, and very nice to have fresh and on-tap on a lazy late afternoon.","Georgiabeer","0"
