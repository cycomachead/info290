3.75,1.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, amber-brown coloring with a foamy, dense, clingy, off-white head. Nose of sweet nut, roasted notes, and hints of caramel. Sweet malty forward, with caramel and toffee notes throughout. Roasty and sweet, on a smooth, light body. Sweet, roasted in the aftertaste, as well, with a smooth, slightly lingering finish. Well put together, balanced, and tasty.","GarthDanielson","Apr 30, 2014"

3.65,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear, dark copper color with a big, rich-looking, creamy head on top. Spicy, leafy hop aromas balanced by toast and cracker-like malts. Leafy/earthy hops continue into the flavor, lightly oily and mild overall, and some nutty, caramel malt. Medium bodied with a moderate bitterness. A nice beverage to start out with...","wedge","Mar 04, 2012"
3.7,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A decent lager that is drinkable enough and has a good flavor. Seems like a session candidate. I am not personally crazy about it but I can't fault it for anything really.","Cylinsier","Feb 10, 2012"

3.64,-1.9,4.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this one is not my favorite offering from Fullsteam, but it is an accessible, easy-drinking beer that serves as a fine flagship for the brewery.","devilben02","Feb 16, 2011"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The competition between sweetness and light bitterness works well here, and I probably prefer this to the couple of other steam beers I've had before (Anchor, Troegs). It has an added caramel malt sweetness that provides some contrast. Well done.","Verecund","Jan 04, 2011"
3.98,7.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Carolina Common, Southern Lager whatever its called its very good.Poured into a becker a slight chill hazed amber/bronze with a large fluffy crown atop that left broken lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Toasty and bready in the nose,quite yeasty as well with light fruity esters.A little sharp in the mouth but not anything to hindering going on,flavors are yeasty and toasted,some caramel sweetness thruought,a decent drying earthy finish.A full flavored steam beer wich I think is an under appreciated style,a very nice lager beer.","oberon","Jan 02, 2011"

3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: An interesting take on a regional style. The additional caramel malt sweetness with the elevated fermentation character adds a dimension to the beer that takes it in a completely different direction than Anchor's Steam Beer. Fairly firm bitterness but with some residual sweetness in the finish that competes for dominance. A good solid beer.","TheRabidBrewer","Oct 06, 2010"

3.91,5.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A clear caramel copper color with a decent fluffy white head and great lacing. The aroma says wheat and yeast with some spiciness. The flavor is unique. A bitter leafy hop over biscuity fruit sweetness. I get apple, melon and bright toasted pumpkin. It's a crispy feel with tingly carbonation and medium bodied. Definitely quite drinkable, as well. Recommended for a try and something I would quench my thirst on any time.","Durge","Oct 05, 2010"
3.88,4.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Beer is medium to light in body with a nice forward presence, not much in the middle and a mild bitterness with a mild dry finish to the whole thing. I like it. The dryness isn't distracting or palate wrecking, its a decent beer. I'd have it again.","drabmuh","Sep 14, 2010"
3.88,4.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Also of note was the growler glass itself, which was quite cool.","Thorpe429","Beers"
4.02,8.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"On-tap at Rockfish Grill served in an 18oz schooner a crisp amber with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice amount of sweet malts with slight earthy hops. The taste is a very nice balance of crisp earthy citrus hops and sweet caramel malts. The beer is very smooth, crisp and refreshing. This is another great beer from Fullsteam, while it's not my personal favorite of theirs, I can see it as worthy of being their flagship.","atsprings","0"
