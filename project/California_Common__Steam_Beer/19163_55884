It just seems like a boring style to me. It is easy drinking. It kind of reminds me of a Euro lager.","buschbeer","Aug 24, 2014"
3.25,-0.9,,,,,,"The Steamy Windows is decent not spectacular.  The beer I had was overprimed which I'm sure affected the taste and scent.  The beer poured a golden color with huge white fizzy head that left some lacing.  The scent was grassy like.  The taste was crisp and clean.  Overall it was ok,","WoodBrew","Aug 16, 2014"

But the added bonus of the light spicing and fruit esters make this really refreshing. The sweet to bitter balance could not be more perfect. I will go back to this again and again....when I am in Michigan. #pureMichigan","Badger6","Apr 16, 2014"

As a microbrewery, you never want your beer to resemble either of those extremes; Steamy Windows, the only beer I've yet to try from Liberty Street Brewing, seems like it could have been made by either. That's not a good first impression.","biegaman","Aug 31, 2013"

3.62,10.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"Nothing mind blowing, here, but it was certainly something you could kick back and drink a bunch of without getting fatigued (or drunk, for that matter). Mellow and contempt, I think I may actually prefer this one to Anchor Steam, although it's been a while since I've had that one, maybe too long to compare. Not something I would actively seek out, but something I'd get from time to time at the brewpub for a relaxing change of pace.","tectactoe","Mar 18, 2013"

2.75,-16.2,3,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Overall I wasn't a fan or impressed by this beer and I thought it was a below average example of the style. it was pretty dull and somehow managed to be rough around the edges, it didn't have all the aspects that I look for in the style. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the taste for sure didn't hold my attention, one is more than enough for me, I don't want to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it seemed pretty true to style but it could have been a little smoother. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was pretty simple and dull and the flavors didn't seem nearly as clean as they should be. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not worth my time and I can't say that I would recommend it to anyone. All in all I was pretty let down with this beer, so far Liberty Street has been disappointing me, both the beers they have bottled have been pretty underwhelming with this one being the worst of the two, I know they can make some good beer, I have had them before, but if they keep bottling these bland beers instead, it's not going to work out good for them, better luck next time guys this one needs some work and so Far it's my least favorite beer from Liberty Street.","StoutHunter","Sep 15, 2012"

4.32,31.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is hoppy, smooth, wet. Great tasting. Not overly complex or challenging but really good. It seems to me that Liberty Street just brews solid gold. I had no idea what I was ordering when I said I wanted a "Steamy Window" but I'm willing to do that here because I know they don't brew garbage. Another great brew. I just wish more people could experience these brews instead of just people in southeast Michigan!","h00dak","0"
