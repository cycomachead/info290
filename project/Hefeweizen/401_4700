3.9,10.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, best before 5/4/2014. Pours hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, banana, pear, clove, bubblegum, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, banana, pear, clove, bubblegum, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light bready tartness and yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, banana, pear, clove, bubblegum, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale/bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice hefeweizen style. All around good robustness and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 12, 2014"

4.05,14.4,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden yellow in color with a good 1-finger foamy white head that settles to about 3mm on top. A decent amount of sediment is found at the bottom of the bottle. Spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of wheat, bananas, cloves and yeast. Pretty much the same for the taste that follows the nose. Perfect carbonation. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Overall, not a bad 'hefe' and you can't beet the price for this Russian beer.","BeerWithMike","Jun 30, 2014"
