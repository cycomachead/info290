3.59,0.6,3.75,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Very fruity and sweet aroma. A nice hint of banana with a slight spice/tartness, finishes somewhat dry. Overall it's a nicely balanced beer that doesn't have too much of anything but also doesn't especially stand out.","jfugeman","Feb 18, 2015"
3.92,9.8,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a whitish/golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of banana, wheat. Taste is very refreshing. Banana's, wheat, a bit of cloves, tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer.","tone77","Feb 17, 2015"
