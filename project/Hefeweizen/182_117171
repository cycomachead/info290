4.22,18.5,4,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"O: Yuengling surprised me with this uncharacteristic offering. It's a really good American Hefeweizen. The lack of banana and degree of bitterness definitely put this into the American camp, but among those peers I think it competes really well. Almost as good as Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis. If you like Hefes, pick this up, drink it cold. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","Freecell","Mar 23, 2015"

3.58,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Overall:  Wow!  A weizenbier that I like!  Lots of bready, cereal-like flavors, blended beautifully by some honey-like sweetness and some pleasant lemony citrus.  There are none of the traditional weizenbier flavors of bubblegum and Band-AidsÂ® which suits me just fine!","Jeffreysan","Dec 05, 2014"
