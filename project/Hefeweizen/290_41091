2.93,-15.1,4,3.5,2.5,3,2.75,"This wasn't what I expected at all. The best attribute is its look, which is an amber and orange with a foamy head. Aroma is ok, mainly grapefruit. From there it goes downhill for me. It tastes like orange crush much less like grapefruit. I detected neither hops, wheat or any other beer flavors. The feel is light and easy. The low ABV gave me no buzz whatsoever. Despite its lightness, I cannot call it so drinkable because of the cloying artificial sweetness. Not for me.","Gajo74","Mar 10, 2015"
