Aroma, well, is like smelling the tail end of an agitated skunk that sat in a bowl of rotten lemons. Let's hope the taste is better. Taste is much much better than the smell, with flavors of tart lemon and other assorted citrus coming forth and a tartness that is very nice. Malt takes a backseat to the refreshing lemony taste. Mouthfeel is very nice with lots of carbonation and this is one smooth beer !!","hophugger","Mar 02, 2015"
