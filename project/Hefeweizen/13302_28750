Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, spice, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that seems pretty basic, but it's fairly tasty and refreshing for what it is.","UCLABrewN84",
