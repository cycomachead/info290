The Sch√∂fferhofer name does not exactly possess the same gravitas that the big-name German wheat beer brewers do - but their Hefeweizen is still a relatively good example of the style. Not my first choice, but perfectly acceptable in a pinch. This one has a bit more of an orangey-citrus kick than I'm used to from a hefe, but if you're a witbier fan then you'll probably appreciate this difference. At 2 bucks and change for a can, wheat beer enthusiasts have no reason not to give this one a shot.","thehyperduck","Feb 25, 2015"

4.13,13.8,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Hazy straw colour in the glass. Sweet aromas with esters and maybe a hint of cloves coming through. Hops in the aroma too. Very refreshing ( though I had it on a hot Brisbane day so anything would have been good) and the fruity flavour came though less than in other hefeweizens I've had. This might put some off but I enjoyed the slight bitterness to this as I'm not a big fan of banana ester flavours. Good crisp feel in the mouth with sharp-ish carbonation. Overall a very nice refreshing beer. The fruitiness came through as the beer warmed but I like the balance of this Hefeweizen.","Decko","Feb 15, 2015"
