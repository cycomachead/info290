4.1,5.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into weizen glass, bottled on 8/1/2014. Pours hazy bright golden color with a 2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, orange, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice and slight bready tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish or a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavor; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Hefeweizen. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 22, 2015"

2.81,-27.9,2.5,2.75,2.75,3,3,"Mild citrus aroma with a hint of skunkiness. Hazy mild amber color with quarter inch head. Has a light citrus taste. Seems like a weak representation of this style. Faint banana like taste. Though not bad tasting I was a bit disappointed by this. I’m a huge fan of this style and was feeling let down by this one.","rjplumer","Jan 31, 2015"
