3.75,-3.4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"i like good german hefe, so its always cool to have a new one, and this beer was the perfect compliment to a true authentic chicago deep dish pizza pie. some light contrast to the heaviest meal on the planet. pale pale yellow, and super clear for a hefeweizen, until the last few drops of the bottle come out. the head is tall and white, rich, almost too rich looking for the light beer it rests on, and it lasts forever. the nose is all banana and watered down wheat malt, not nearly as creamy and textured as some of these, which i do enjoy, but i also like the lightness of this one, especially in the context of my meal. the carbonation is also really charged up, helping it wash down the heavy food and cleanse my palate perfectly every time. the banana esters are strong in the taste, but its not a candied sort of thing like it can be, its just a real delicate thing, really soft and clean, not distracting or obnoxious. i have not had a german hefe this light i dont think, i could power slam these all summer long, and maybe i will now. great compliment to big rich food.","StonedTrippin",
