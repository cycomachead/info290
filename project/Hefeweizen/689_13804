The aroma is of yeast and grains for the most part. More going on with the taste as there is some vanilla, clove and hint of banana also. Smooth to drink and goes down easy with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. A tasty brew!","BeerWithMike","Jan 04, 2015"

I just wanted to chime in and note that I did not find the banana to be too strong, I loved the lightness of the beer, and it came across as a good, traditional weiss beer with a good balance of flavors -- good stuff!","BeerHistoryGuy","Dec 13, 2014"
