3.45,-10.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"It smells very nice (and Belgian), it looks very nice, it boasts a killer name (and some nice back-label patter), and the ratcheted-up hop-load does the job of keeping the ale crisp and clean-finishing—even a bit nicely bitter, to balance out the healthy dose of wheaty sweetness—but overall there's something lacking and something decidedly less than great about Mad King's … though maybe, with a name like that, balance and high aptitude shouldn't have been expected.","OrestesMethuon","Dec 16, 2014"
