4.9,22.8,4.5,5,5,4.75,4.75,"500ml bottle in a glass.  Orange, amber in color with a thin head that dissipates quickly.  Smells like banana.  Very smooth taste, reminiscent of a Hoegaarden, but more full bodied with a few fruit notes thrown in.  Highly recommended.","ENogueira","Jan 31, 2015"
4.17,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.25,"Has that classic banana clove coriander aroma.Soft amber haze color.The color for some reason just doesnâ€™t have the same appeal as others of the style. A two inch foamy head. Refreshing banana and citrus taste. Has a mild creamy but zesty mouth feel.","rjplumer","Jan 31, 2015"
