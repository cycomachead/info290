3.85,0,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a nice Hefeweizen. It pours a straw yellow color with an impressive foamy head. Aroma is earthy, lemon like; a  hint sweet malt takes over as the drink warms. Taste consists of lemon, wheat, and a tiny hint of honey. Smooth, crisp and refreshing feel. A good warm weather drink.","Gajo74","Mar 11, 2015"

4.13,7.3,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Each bottle of this brew from my 6-pack is loaded with yeast and trub begging for gentle agitation prior to pouring. A soft hazy 20 caret gold colored brew having majestically odoriferous aromas of lemon, banana and a touch of clove make for a very enjoyable balance of flavors. The weight of this brew is slightly light for the style, though super crisp and refreshing. A touch of lip smacking sweetness begs for another mouthful. A very enjoyable well made Hefe, worthy of your interest.","barknee","Jan 18, 2015"
