4.27,10.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Tried this out at the brewery the other day. Pours a hazy orangeish-yellow with a white head. Smells like a hefeweizen with a few citrus notes. It tastes a bit sweeter than a lot of wheat beers I have tried with banana, clove, and citrus flavors, all of which a fairly well balanced. Definitely a pretty interesting beer using hefeweizen yeast, flavored with witbier ingredients, and it did a good job","Joe_Howard","Feb 19, 2015"
