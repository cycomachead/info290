3.94,-3.7,3.75,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a golden yellow with decent head, limited retention and almost no lacing on the glass as I drank.  You get some wheat in the smell but the spice and clove dominate.  Taste follows the nose, a lot of spice and clove dominating.  Not real creamy.  Overall a decent beer but not outstanding.","JamieDuncan","Feb 15, 2015"

4.04,-1.2,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Love these rustic country-style weissbiers from Schneider. Little in the way of commercial polish. No fear of the clove. Or the hop. The bold molasses nose stands out as well. Could perhaps stand to be a tad fizzier.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 18, 2015"
