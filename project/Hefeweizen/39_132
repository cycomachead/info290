3.39,-18.7,3.25,3,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours a semi-cloudy light gold color. Average head and very small, spotty lacing. Aroma is banana, some orange and bread dough. Taste is very nice with touches of yeast, orange and a nice pleasant amount of semi-ripe banana. Mouthfeel is nice and light and refreshing. Carbonation seems to just be right for this beer. Light, clean finish !!","hophugger","Mar 21, 2015"
4.17,0,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"On tap at Fassler Hall OKC. Pours into the stein a cloudy gold with a creamy white head. It reduces eventually to a thin layer with no lacing. Smells of bready malt with a touch of banana and spice. It's much the same with the taste. Creamy malt with cloves and a little banana. Chewy medium mouth. Very traditional and very good.","MartzMimic","Mar 21, 2015"

3.96,-5,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"been getting in to the old world german stuff super hard lately, and this one is a good one. i enjoyed this one at 1472 on pearl street last night, an entirely forgettable experience from a cuisine and service standpoint, but this is a fine glass of ale. modeled on a hefe, its a little bit different, plenty yeasty in color but not nearly as bright. the head is short lived too, although dirty glassware or something could be at fault. the nose is awesome, classic hefe yeast profile, modest in the banana notes, fully rocking the clove side of things, like fresh banana bread, its baked and grainy and hearty, not as light and creamy as others, more doughy and thick, and the carbonation isnt quite there, but there is a rustic richness that defines this one for me. all of the ayinger stuff is really nice, but its cool to have one of the original styles they do. this is excellent and distinct from others. the prices on these are so fair in the stores, i need to make a point to try more. there is something to be said for paying a few bucks for a 500ml of a beer this good than say a 16 dollar four pack from off color or prairie and getting something of similar overall quality...","StonedTrippin","Mar 11, 2015"
