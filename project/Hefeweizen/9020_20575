Less flavor and less fresh tasting than blue moon. I was hoping for something to rival live oak and ended up wishing I had a blue moon.","halo3one","Dec 03, 2014"

3.8,2.7,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of bananas, cloves, delicious. Taste is wheat, banana, clove, very refreshing and smooth. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a satisfying session beer.","tone77","Nov 23, 2014"
