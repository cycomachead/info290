Smells yeasty and of biscuit. Tastes refreshing, with tons of banana and biscuity flavor, little notes of spice as well. A tremendous, refreshing hefe; one of the pillars of the style, clearly.","TheElectricOne","Saturday at 03:08 PM"

4.91,11.3,4.5,4.75,5,5,5,"Simply the best Hefe I've ever had. The standard by which all others are judged. Enjoyed many times over the years in various glasses. Always a pleasant pour with a frothy head. Rich mouth feel with medium to light carbonation. Notes of banana and spice.","DukeAndGonzo","Mar 31, 2015"

3.85,-12.7,4.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"It's a great beer. It poured beautifully, had notes of ripen bananas and fruity esters. Very easy to drink and light-bodied. It seems to be missing that subtle peppery bite that I look for in a hefeweizen. It doesn't compare to New Glarus Dancing Man - which has set the bar really high. It might be that this beer is not fresh. Could not find the bottle date and bought this off a shelf at room temp. I have no doubt that drinking this straight from the source or from a fresh bottle would leave this beer tasting much better than now. I will take the next opportunity to try this beer again when I find it refrigerated.","Benish","Mar 30, 2015"

Maybe the main streamers who put a lemon wedge in this stuff are right. Think it would help.","wizmasta","Mar 29, 2015"
