It seems to be missing that subtle peppery bite that I look for in a hefeweizen. It doesn't compare to New Glarus Dancing Man - which has set the bar really high. It might be that this beer is not fresh. Could not find the bottle date and bought this off a shelf at room temp. I have no doubt that drinking this straight from the source or from a fresh bottle would leave this beer tasting much better than now. I will take the next opportunity to try this beer again when I find it refrigerated.","Benish","Mar 30, 2015"

A very hazy rich golden-yellow color with a fluffy pure white head that slowly fades leaving slight lacing.  Aroma is of bread, yeast and slight citrus.  Taste is really nice with some citrus and bread followed by a muted cinnamon/nutmeg-like spiciness that really makes the beer.  Towards the bottom of the pint, the beer started to have a slight metallic after-taste, maybe due to the trip across the Atlantic.  Goes down really easy, but is not super thin - enough body to keep you from pounding it, but enough carbonation to keep it refreshing.  Overall, a fantastic wheat beer and a great deal for the price.","FFreak","Mar 23, 2015"

Produced a nice 3-finger fluffy white head, very persistent, the head lasted a good five minutes and left some very nice lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass.  The beer is a golden yellow color, thick and hazy, just as a good hefeweizen should look. The aroma of this beer is huge, with wheat, cloves, malt, some light citrus and just a hint of banana. The clove flavors really shine in the taste, along with some nice citrusy notes and banana, with a very nice sweet malty backbone.  The mouthfeel is very nice, medium bodied, creamy smooth on the front of the tongue, with the high carbonation adding just  the perfect finish on the back of the palate. This hefe is the standard against which all other hefe's should be measured. A world-class beer at such an outstanding price - I paid about a dollar each - outstanding beer at a super-low price- sign me up!","timontheroad","Dec 04, 2014"

I understand that it is intended for the yeasts to give off a flavor similar to this, and that many other people enjoy it, but it is just not for me, and I think it's only fair for my score to reflect my own experience with the beer. I guess I'm one of those people who are too sensitive to the yeasts/phenols for this kind of beer to be enjoyable. For now I will give up on this style, or maybe try a kristalweizen next.","enjambed","Oct 12, 2014"

P: Doesn't leave much behind on the palate but is nicely carbonated. O: I enjoyed this beer very much. It was refreshing and has become one of my favorite Hefeweizen. It is a very good after dinner beer, due to not being filling or heavy. A must have if you enjoy wheat beers.","Jason_the_Argonaut","Sep 28, 2014"

Except for the banana coming to the front once in a while, I didn't think any flavor was particularly dominant. All of the flavors were balanced and smooth, contributing to the overall flavor without being "over the top". Great brew!","LeRose","Sep 08, 2014"

So, I was a little hesitant to buy this one, but I wanted a hefe, and the guy at Specs said this is the best they have. I still like Live Oak better, but just by a hair. I have seen a number of reviews that rated this beer down a bit, and I would say that something you might do is let it warm up a bit. I started this one at fridge temp, and wasn't really that impressed at first. However, I was called away for a bit, and when I came back the beer had warmed up to probably upper forties, or even higher in temp, and it was AMAZING. It really opened up and a lot of flavor came out.","KDHicks1958","Jul 19, 2014"

The aroma was classic hefe with the clove spice and banana yeast. The taste followed with the full bodied banana yeast and spices floating on top of a grainy wheat base. There was practically no perceptible bitterness to be found just Hefe heaven. The mouthfeel had a perfect amount of body and thickness to be a substantial and satisfying drink. Despite the fullness I found the beer to be refreshing while not sacrificing the full flavor of the hefeweizen. The Weihenstephaner really nails the style. A perfect Hefe.","brurevu","Jun 22, 2014"

The smell is heavy with wheat that brings to mind bananas and really fresh bread. The taste was exceptional, with sweetness in the beginning that turns to the almost minty spice of the wheat. The feel was amazingly refreshing for being thick and just full of flavor. Probably my favorite import and can not recommend it highly enough.","WhiteHillsStore","May 17, 2014"

Truly an amazing hefe and you don't even have to seek it out. Therefore, this is the only hefe worth buying in my opinion. Beats others in the style, Bavarian or not, at a competitive price point.

4.84,9.8,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.75,"We sampled the brewery's Hefe Weissbier ("HW") in a 500 ml bottle purchased from the LCBO, with a best before date of September 9, 2012. HW was 5.4% alcohol by volume. It poured a naturally cloudy, light orange colour with about 2" of fluffy, white, long lasting head that left plenty of lacing and spotting down the glass. The aroma was fabulous...bananas, cloves and yeast...and remember that this is a beer that complies with the Bavarian purity law and therefore contains no bananas or cloves. Darn clever, the things those Germans can do with the right strain of yeast! The taste very much followed the aroma, with bananas, cloves, wheat and yeast evident. The amount of carbonation was just right with lots of small bubbles on the tongue, and the mouthfeel was creamy. HW also had the clean finish I look for in my favourite beers. Ladies and gentlemen, if this isn't the epitome of the brewer's art, it has to be close! At $3.05 per 500 ml bottle this beer is a decent value for money as well, and HW now joins my short list of regular purchases.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

The aroma is sweet right up front with wheat and cloves. The taste is real close to that with the slight tangy clove finish. Clean and crisp and goes down very easy. No bitter or harsh after taste at all. Very slightly dry at the end. Overall, really a great brew!","BeerWithMike","Feb 04, 2014"

Wet patches of bubbles cling to the walls of the tulip. The aroma is of strong clove, banana, wheat, straw, freshly cut grass, and hay. Very floral and refreshing. The taste follow suits, with a strong clove and banana presence amongst a wheat and hay background. Some faint lemon citrus, white pepper, and crisp grape juice sensation round it out. Mouthfeel is delectable; light, crisp, and lively with an effervescent and dry finish. Overall, this is a phenomenal hefeweissbier that I’m always happy to have. The clove in this is very predominant, but masterfully integrated such that it doesn’t seem overpowering.","eclipse54","Jan 24, 2014"

It's a stark difference from the last hefe I had, which I think was a Widmer almost a year ago - it's just no comparison, they are two totally different beasts.

I just LOVE the really forward banana flavor of the Ayinger and the champagne mouthfeel. Its just a matter of preference. If you handed me either one of these beers I'd give you my first born child. The Weihenstephaner is a better deal though. I can get it for less than $2 a bottle (11.2oz) while the Ayinger is about $3.50 (16oz) a bottle (it has about 5oz more of yummy juice though).","Fear4Beer","Oct 01, 2013"

4.6,4.3,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Pours a nice hazy light amber with a large amount of white foam. Aroma is strongly fruity, with strong yeast and sweet malt. Tastes like a classic, iconic take on the style, cloves and allspice, banana and perhaps another tropical flavor like subtle mango, more hops than other examples of the style which cut the intense sweetness but not enough to wreck the sweetness or push it too far away, a near perfect balance really. Where Ayinger is weighted towards the fruit, this one leans towards the spice, with a strong clove flavor building as you progress through a bottle. Finish lingers and leaves some yeasty sweetness and a little bitterness. Overall, complex and layered flavors that are light years away from an American wheat made with standard yeast.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 09, 2013"

The beer was very drinkable and could be sessioned easily. It poured a hazy yellow with nice white head that did not leave much of a lace. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation.

It is the best example of a Bavarian Hefe Weissbier out there and you owe yourself the experience that this beer will provide. I am rating this beer as a wheat beer and therefore I'll give it a perfect 5/5 in all categories because this is what other wheat beers want to be. After almost 1,000 years of brewing it makes sense that the flavor and quality of this beer is where it is.","Weston19","Jul 29, 2013"

I would classify it as a good beer, but certainly not the 98 it is getting here. It tastes like a seasonal, flavored offering to me.

I bought my bottle for a little under $3 and it's the best $3 I've ever spent. I've seen other on tap but have not tried and want to. Do not pass this beer up.

Flavor matches the nose, with banana and clove complementing a refined wheat flavor. The wheat becomes most pronounced in the finish, while the front end remains more juicy. Yeast character lends some nice complexity and texture as well. The mouthfeel is spectacular, with lively, velvety carbonation that caresses the palate and enhances the quintessential flavors of the beer. This is the hefeweizen to which all other hefeweizens are compared. It's supremely balanced, perfectly executed, and possessed of perhaps the most enjoyable mouthfeel of any beer, regardless of style--undoubtedly world class.","MaximalC","May 15, 2013"

I was also an idiot and drank it straight from the bottle but that didn't stop it from being delicious. Bought a single from Wegmans for about $3. My first impressions likened this beer to fresh banana bread with some clove, and it was very smooth and easy to drink. Had a good combination of bitterness and sweetness that was both subtle and pleasant in character. A definite treat and the best wheat beer I’ve tried to this date.","Fusion7777","Feb 01, 2013"

A lightly sugary sweet malt provides a backdrop for the showcase of yeasty aromas. the flavor is lightly sweet malt with a bready yeasty taste. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. This is a really nice beer!

When the head retention and lacing left are exceptional, the aroma and flavor drive forth so mellow, inviting, fresh yet balance with a big touch of fruity ester, citric/lemony zest and bubblegum that nicely parade with a sweet biscuity malt and clove with a spice while wheat with a twang. The feel is smooth with a velvety body and refreshingly crispness/dryness. No doubt this beer is cult, my veneration to the old Weihenstephan again.","Everydayoff","Dec 19, 2012"

4.5,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer tastes richly of bubblegum banana with clove spice notes. The beer begins with bubblegum and spice; just as it is building in flavor a slight yeasty funk can be felt in the taste, but is quickly washed away by the big banana bread flavors that have been building in the mouth. This eventually wanes down into a banana aftertaste with light clove and bubblegum hints at the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel of this beer is superbly creamy, with light carbonation and a medium to slightly heavy and leaves the mouth with a thick sticky feeling on the tongue while the mouth as a whole feels clean, but slightly coated in candied banana. Overall, this is a superb hefeweizen, as would be expected from the oldest brewery in the world. I hold this up there with Zero Gravities Weizenheimer as the best in the style. A superb beer that epitomizes and optimizes the style beautifully. This beer is a must try.","Maxwell","Dec 09, 2012"

Mouthfeel is light on carbonation and alcohol. Taste is a brilliant explosion of malt, bready yeast, clove/banana and delicate sweetness. Finish is smoother than water off a duck's back. No bitterness at all. While most weissbiers lean one way or the other on the sweetness scale, Weihenstepher nails the balance perfectly. One of the best beers in the world.","Bayern1971","Sep 23, 2012"

5,13.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy, yeasty golden color with a two finger fluffy white head that receded to a ring of white foam leaving lacing on the glass. An excellent appearance, very true to style. Near flawless. Scents of clove, banana, slight citrus, some wheat malt and a low level of vanilla. A very good aroma profile that hits the style dead-on. Nothing is off, everything is present and it's all fantastic. Very nice. Flavor begins with spicy cloves phenols and a bit of banana esters, moving into more clove phenols but now balanced equally with banana esters and a slight citrus-like sourness. An undertone of cracker-like malt is present throughout the entire sip. Finishes with an equal balance of banana esters and clove phenols, with a slight lemony sourness. Aftertaste is spicy clove phenols and faint banana esters. An excellent flavor profile. The main flavors of the style reveal themselves in full form and several of the optional flavors also come into play. Very well done, balanced and refreshing, perfect. Mouthfeel is light bodied, effervescent with high carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. A very nice, refreshing mouthfeel that is perfectly true to style. Overall this is an amazing hefeweizen. Everything about it is a perfect representation of the style, and this is my number one recommendation to anyone who wants to try a good Bavarian hefeweizen.","Auraan","Jul 27, 2012"

I had to pour this beer, walk away, and then come back to finish the pour; the head was huge, fluffy, like a giant cloud with no lacing left as I drink it. The nose is very bright citrus, orange, coriander, and white bread. The taste is again full of bright citrus notes, with banana and yeasty sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy with the a nice touch of carbonation. Very delightful. Overall, this beer is a fantastic hefe that I've been looking forward to trying. It's a great representative of the style and hits all the right points perfectly. I will definitely stock this for the summer.","estlinska","Jun 29, 2012"

The appearance was average, but I must say after pouring this beer into a glass it does leave behind a nice head. What I was most impressed with was the mouthfeel and the unique taste. The mouthfeel was very creamy and smooth, with essentially no bitter points whatsoever. The hoppy smell threw me off a little bit, because there are so many other flavors that strike you prior to the slight hop aftertaste. Above else, cloves were the first thing I could taste. Banana was probably the second most pungent flavor, followed by wheat, yeast, malt, a bit of caramel, and hops. Overall a pretty solid beer. Not one of my favorite, but definitely something different and for its class a very good brew. I'd give it a 8/10.","Nfl1991","Jun 07, 2012"

When this brewery was founded in 1040 AD, I wonder if the very first brewmaster expected it would still be around nearly 1,000 years later. But with the cloudy, heady pale yellow pour leading up to a tremendous aroma of pale malts, banana, clove, and yeast, I can imagine how an 11th Century beer drinker must have been refreshed on a warm medieval day. The light body is satisfying for the style. There is a slight zing of citrus goodness in the taste with the same flavor sensations that were introduced by way of the nose. It finishes clean and easy. The original is still one of the best in the world.","puboflyons","May 20, 2012"

Mouthfeel is light-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best year-round, easy-to-get hefe in existence. It's a great beer for a hot day, and very refreshing. The only things that hold this back from a higher score are that 1) hefeweizens aren't my favorite style and 2) it's not quite on the level of my two favorite hefes, the Andechs and the Live Oak.","starrdogg","May 17, 2012"

Well, it was fine, but... I don't get all the crazy praise for it. It was good but didn't do much more for me than other hefes, which I'm starting to have my doubts about. I'm wondering if the style is a narrow one, in which the differences between different offerings are small. If you served this to me I'd be happy enough, but rather than buy it again I'd rather explore other untried options. I will say it had a very pretty snowy white head. Seems like a good example of the style but I was let down that it wasn't crazy turbo good like the hype suggested. Or maybe I'm just not a hefe guy.","BrownNut","Mar 22, 2012"

Poured it into a new Paulaner hefe glass (also purchased at Tanakaya), and enjoyed enjoyed enjoyed! The head on this is ridiculously amazing, delicious and long-lasting, lacing the glass like a frappe. Loved watching all the particles float around in the glass, heightening the smell of orange and wheat and the taste of the same. The only thing I could ask for is a bit thicker of a brew just to give my tongue something else to play with. Other than that, this is the best hefe I have ever had, and especially for the price (relatively cheap), I will be a fan of this for life! GET IT!","shigg85","Feb 20, 2012"

Upon first sip, one instantly recognizes that hearty wheat flavor, combined with a comfortable, relaxed, light body mouth feel that is extremely satisfying. After a few sips one begins to appreciate the subtle complexity of the beer, with orange and light citrus hints as well as the classic German yeasty-malty flavor.

Pours a beautiful deep yellow gold color that leaves a nice two finger white head that slowly recedes and leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of wheat, banana, citrus. Taste is on point for a hefe; nicely balanced wheat, citrus, banana, and a light bitterness at the end. Everything about this beer in the taste department is done brilliantly. Mouthfeel is good, fairly light overall and easy to drink a pint or two. All in all, if you want a good hefe, this is the one to go to.","gatorguy","Jan 05, 2012"

This looks like a beer should look when poured. hazy straw colored, with a solid 2 finger head that leaves plenty of lacing and carbonation filling the glass. its smells of citrus and funk and makes your mouth water. The wheat flavor is up front with good funk finishing up with a crisp refeshing mouthfeel and a bit floral at the end. This is well done and could stand up nexrt to just about anythings the state try and produce in this wheat variety. Bravo German brew dudes.","unclejazz","Jan 04, 2012"

4.58,3.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"500 ml bottle. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a huge 3 finger dense white head with incredible retention that reduces to a cap that stays for the remainder of the glass. Thick lacing clings around the glass as well, incredible. Aromas of big banana, clove, bubblegum, pepper, lemon, and spicy yeast. Fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength. Taste of big clove, pepper, banana, bubblegum, lemon, bread, and spicy yeast. Light bitterness on the finish that lingers with citrus, pepper, banana, and spices for a bit. Extremely smooth and slightly creamy medium sized body. Fairly lively carbonation that dies down as I make my way through the glass. Extremely well balanced with the flavor profile as well. Overall this is an absolutely incredible wheat beer; and the definition of a hefeweizen in my opinion. I will keep coming back to this one at only $3 for a half liter at the store.","superspak","Dec 27, 2011"
