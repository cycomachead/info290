Who knows: its excellence may have been swallowed up that day by the beers I drank around it; but, as a lunch-time, first-of-the-day beer, it really is a nice, 3F-consummate treatment of the beating wheat heart of Bavaria.","OrestesMethuon","Dec 15, 2014"

Really nice aroma of banana esters, honey, yeasty hefe funk, pears, sweetness. Flavor is sweet banana esters, light honey sweetness, pears, yeasty yeasties, lingering sweetness. Light bodied with plus carbonation as expected from the style. This is really nicely done actually.","BMMillsy","Oct 29, 2014"
