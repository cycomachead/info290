4.08,14.3,3.75,4.5,4,3.75,4,"First impression was that it did not look completely like a Hefe.  It seemed lighter in appearance and not quite cloudy enough, also a very limited head that was quickly gone.  Smell was similar, seemed to have a rich smell but not very strong.  Taste followed the look and smell.  Not quite the tasty flavor that you want if you hefe.  Kinda a light version, one word description would be bland.  There was a little bit of tart which seemed more like a berliner weiss which is more of what it looked like.  On the positive side it is very clean, crisp, and easy to drink.  Overall, not as rich as you want in a hefe but a pretty good, enjoyable beer.","JamieDuncan","Nov 16, 2014"

2.75,-23,,,,,,"O: This wasn't a complex hef. It was too watery and had no yeast flavor. The funk or skunk quality almost prompted me to drain pour it, but I held on and didn't get sick afterwards. Maybe it was a bad batch. Based on what I had, there are many better hefs out there.","WAbeerfiend","Sep 11, 2014"
