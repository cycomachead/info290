3.86,5.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,4.5,4,"The banana clove makes this beer stand out. Great German hefenweizen. Good carbonation all the way through with a rich wheat flavor that keeps it light and crisp. The banana clove nose makes this an intriguing tasty beer. Great beer for rolling into spring.","DSnow85","Feb 19, 2015"
