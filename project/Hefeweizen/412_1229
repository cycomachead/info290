3.97,-1.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"how have i not heard of this before? its so good, enjoyed on tap at bull and bush last night. man those guys have really stepped up their guest tap game! this is a strange take on the hefe style, although im sure its far more traditional than many of the american ones i have sort of let pervert my interpretation of authentic. this is really really cloudy, yeasty, and thick. its not all that appealing looking in the pint glass aside from the off white head it comes out with and holds for a few minutes. it smells the part, wheat heavy for sure, tannic and textures right off the get go with the grain, but it fits. what surprised me the most about this german hefe, is that its not very banana forward. thats the main flavor descriptor with these, and its in such trace amounts as to be irrelevant here, yet the beer is still super yeasty, which is almost hard to figure out. bready and doughy and breakfasty, but not banana. not clove either, no spice here really at all, the yeast is mild, but its also somehow full flavored. impressive, and i like it more the more i drink it. filler bodied, and not as well carbonated as some others, but this beer is pretty awesome on the whole, and i could pick it out of a crowd of 100 hefeweizens, which i cant say about too many beers. really solid stuff, rustic, timeless.","StonedTrippin","Feb 20, 2015"

4.75,17.6,,,,,,"Pours a hazy orange-apricot in color with a good 4 to 5 finger white frothy/foamy head that last a good bit before finally settling down to a good 3mm or so after 15 mins. A good amount of sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle. Decent lacing is seen that sticks to the glass in 'wishbone' form. The aroma is very pleasant of sweet wheat, banana with a hint of spice. Pretty much the same for the taste with the wheat, spice (cloves) banana with a touch of honey coming through for the very smooth finish. Goes down very easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all! Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation , which isn't much actually. A really great brew! PROST!","BeerWithMike","Nov 30, 2014"
