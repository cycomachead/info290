Taste of chocolate and Maybe a little bit of coffee with the flavor of the traditional lager in the back ground very ever so slightly creamy and goes down smooth and very refreshing for a dark beer compared to most I've had not quite a craft beer but not just your normal either definitely recommend it to someone who wants to get into craft beers excellent place to start","bigzack420","Friday at 02:57 PM"
2.93,-9,2.75,2.75,3,3,3,"Pours a dark brown color. Holding it to the light it appears burnt red in color. Very little head, minimal lacing. Aroma is roasted malts some cocoa and coffee, but a main wiff of corn resides.  Tatse follows the nose, slightly more pleasant than the smell. Mouthfeel is light, somewhat watery but overall not bad. I would just rather thier porter. For black and tans i just make my own. its not bad for the price, but it is what it is.","Ohiolager","Thursday at 11:29 PM"

I haven't had Yuengling Porter and Yeungling Premium Beer individually (stores around here only seem to carry their Traditional Lager, Black & Tan, and Light Lager) so I can't really compare the Black & Tan to each of its component parts just yet, but I'm assuming I--and anyone else who likes those chocolatey "darker beer" flavors--would probably prefer the Porter over this one.","Pantalones","Dec 16, 2014"

The beer was too basic for my liking and the porter part seemed to dominate but when the lager did making an appearance it wasn't welcome and seemed to negatively impact the taste; this one isn't a beer I'd be eager to try again but I wouldn't mind get my hands on some of the brewery's other beers.","flyingpig","Oct 08, 2014"

It's very light-bodied with only hints of hops and the roasted flavor I would expect. Didn't taste any of the caramel the label promised.

While it pours thick and presentable, it drinks thin and forgettable. With little to no hops and a lack of roasted flavors, it tastes comparable to a straight forward, low ABV, watered down, and don't forget flat, Lager. The hints of caramel and coffee mentioned on the label, well those ingredients didn't make it into the batch I received. Long story short, don't drink a traditional layered beer from a 12oz bottle.

Thin enough to quench, but with a little extra flavor. The price point on this is ridiculously low. I'm always impressed when a cheap beer sticks out from crowd, even if its still one dimensional. Solid brew, if you keep some perspective of what its meant to be... a nonoffensive dark for the populace.","Justin23060","Jul 27, 2013"

3.8,18,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Yuengling has pulled through yet again! First off, drink this beer out of a glass rather than a can or bottle. The pour is great. The beer is darker than I had expected and holds a nice head after pouring. This beer smells similar to the Yuengling lager, but with a hint of roasted malt. The taste is very similar to the Yuengling Porter only milder. I enjoy the Porter's flavor but it is too strong for my preferences. The Black & Tan is more mellow while still having that roasted malt taste. The mouthfeel is slightly heavier than the Yuengling lager but is still very drinkable. Overall I give this beer slightly under a 4. For $22 bucks a case it's a great beer. Good micro-brew type flavor at a very reasonable price.","Izzybackyet462","Jun 04, 2013"

The Yuengling porter on it's own is good, so maybe it's the premium beer that gives it the sour taste. The saying "you get what you pay for" comes to mind. A nice beer to grab if you want something cheap and dark, and cheap dark beer is hard to come by so this automatically gets a go-to badge. (Cheap dark beer category)","AC-Mivsek","Feb 25, 2013"

I realize that Yuengling may not be as bold in flavor as some of the other beers here , but as far as middle of the road brews go , I think it does quite well.

The body was a dark brown with no visible carbonation due to the color. The nose presented with mostly roasted malts, grain and then a hint of coffee. Smelled good to me. The beginning of the sip hit me with mild coffee up front and then roasted malts came through. Some sweetness and bread also came through on the subsequent sips. The sweetness mostly manifested as brown sugar, but was altogether mild. The body was a medium thickness with middle of the road carbonation. The finish was relatively long with the roasted malts apparent in the taste. It was an easy drinker with some flavor that I wouldn’t mind having again. I think the style is generally towards the boring side, but this one was probably the best of the style that I’ve had.

Price/availability is a semi redeeming quality. Where it's plentiful, it's a safe choice. Where Yuengling is a rarity, I would probably stick to regular and let the novelty guide my tastebuds.","birdyone","Aug 16, 2012"

Smells like an average, not bold, dark lager. Taste is watered down. A little malty and a little citrusy, and a little hoppy. Everything about the taste is just not bold. Too carbonated, and not very creamy. This beer needs help. It's not terrible, but I expected more. It's not even as good as a normal Yuengling which is also not bold, and a little boring.

3,-6.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Review from notes. Pours a dark cola like color into pint glass with a small quarter inch tan head on it. Smell is a mix of stale lager and dull malt and taste wise much of the same. Kinda what I expected it tastes like a literal mix of their lager and porter combined and frankly I'd reach for either of those before another sixer of this overall it's average and finishes clean and the price is right as always for Yuengling product. Honestly, black and tan's are best made and served by the drinker, a brewed version that combines the 2 perfectly I have yet to encounter. It's a balance that is best left to the drinker, much like adding salt or pepper to a dish everyone's palate is a little different. I'll stick to their porter.","Blueribbon666","Feb 18, 2012"

Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like sweet, roasted and caramel malt, and a bit of coffee. The brew tastes like coffee, chocolate and caramel malt, and a little bit of toffee. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with good carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. For what it is, it's a decent enough brew.

The taste was a little less harsh, but still had the flavors of rich black coffee, burnt wheat, molasses, coco, corn, and malt. Mouthfeel was bold, but lacking in body and smoothness.

It's pretty standard. The taste isn't too shabby though. It's like a like porter and easy to drink. It has the light roast and malt combining to give it enough flavor. The light coffee and malty sweetness do their part. It is a little light in body for the style but it's actually pretty smooth. It actually went really well with my grouper. It's an ok Black and Tan, but pretty good considering it's probably the cheapest one around in a six pack. Not too shabby...","aasher","Apr 14, 2011"

Taste is malty. Lots of roasted malt flavor along with hints of chocolate and a very small amount of coffee. It is a good attempt at putting a black and tan in 1 bottle, but obviously doesn't quite deliver. Easy to drink and has a decent amount of flavor.

3.67,14,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Notes: Yuengling makes good use of its less stellar, Premium brew, as the tan, matched up with their, better than decent, Porter (actually a lager).

3.42,6.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A dark amber color with a finger-width head that fades slowly. There is a bit of hops in the smell as well as roasted malt. In a way, the beer starts like a lager and finishes like a porter. Hops can be tasted but are mostly in the background. A toasty finish suggests the source of the dark part of the beer. Some corn is noted as well. In the mouthfeel, carbonation is present but not overwhelming and medium bodied overall.","biteme398","Feb 05, 2011"

It brings some of the unique flavors found in Yuengling porter to a slightly lighter beer, but make no mistake; the stuff is not weak. It might not be the most delicious beer on the planet, but the combination of good flavor and low price are unbeatable for me as a beer-enthusiast college student (not a drunkard!)

It taste exactly the same but maybe not in that order. Funny that I dont pick up any chocolate at all, this is not a sweet beer by any stretch of the imagination.

I think that the "Black and Tan" style is better made with more flavorful beers and not premixed like this.

But unlike the brews from Saranac, which are a insipid mess; many of which have this particular characteristic,(without the cocoa element) redeems itself with flavors that are enjoyable and result in true drinking satisfaction.

This is easy to drink, and I happily finished off the twelve pack I had that came as a gift, but there was something I recalled and am kinda getting now that I didin't like. I feel that this beer is a bit acidic, just a touch in taste but moreso in feel, it kinda creeps up the throat, like heartburn, after a few of these. I also don't like the finish on this one...dry yes but just not a great aftertaste..almost woody with those chocolate notes fading in the back to something like cardboard. Not very impressive. Easy to drink? Yes, but as far as will I buy this ever?, no. I don't see why people go bat shit crazy for Yuengling. Its okay, maybe good at best....and thats cause the price for something of this quality is unbeatable. I mean look at Berghof, from what I hear Yuengling is cheaper, and its definitely better.

Zounds! Yoi and double yoi! Smell is gettin' a 5 and any a yinz jagovs wanna argue, I'm swingin' a six of CANs atcha! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a definite chocolate taste on the tongue.

Really it just smells like a watered down mild porter. The flavor is about the same. Watered down porter. Chocolate, roasted malts, a bit of cherry and that's about it. All watered down. I really don't get any of the 40% in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is a bit crisp for me. The carbonation is rather biting and nips at the tongue with every gulp.

But I guess that well known mixed drinks call for vodka, gin, bourbon etc. and don't specify the brand just as long as it is the right ingredient, so I also thought a black and tan was a stout on top of a pale ale. Not here though. It says they blend Yuengling Porter with Yuengling Premium, which are significantly lighter than the commonly called-for ingredients, and one is even a lager, so shouldn't it be more of a half and half? It tastes closer to a dunkel - a macro dunkel from the States. That would be closer to the truth I think. What if they just called it "Yuengling Dark"?

Quite refreshing later in the evening and really just not that bad at all. I would definalty be very open to giving this another try.

And yet when you take your first sip, you're met not with a sticky, rich porter but a lighter-feeling, bubbly, tingly mouthfeel and a mild roasted malt taste that is really refreshing. There are hops --somewhere-- because you sense a bit of fruity/veggie background and touch of bitterness in the aftertaste, but the smooth balanced taste of both the premium beer (which is not much to write home about all by itself) and the porter (which is nicely toasted) is irresistable.

If you really like dark beer but its 95 degrees you just mowed the lawn, this is what to reach for. Other than that I can't think of a lot of uses. Maybe if you want to look like you're drinking something badass without actually doing it. Mostly this makes me want to try the porter. Its pretty good but the Traditional Lager packs more of a punch. And if anyone wants to know the recipe and is too lazy to read it themselves its a mix of the Porter and the "Premium" (read Macro). Since this is inexpensive like all Yuengling products you can't go wrong, but they make better imo. As a B&T I guess they do a decent job, but this is my first experience with the style excepting McSorely's which I didn't like, but I also haven't had in so long I can't review it.","casualbeerman","Jan 10, 2006"

The color was a nice rich dark color, with a little bit of a head that lasted a few minutes. The taste was very malty and roasted nutty like. The smell was like roasted nuts, but with a hint of alcohol. I really dig this beer and plan on drinkin' it for years to come.","JISurfer","Sep 09, 2003"

Now, I know its tough to package a black and tan, and I do miss the neato floating stout on the ale, but this is an accesible offering that stacks up pretty durn well. It pours a deep brown, with a small tan head. There is dissapointing retention on the head, but its not real noticeable as the beer is so smooth and drinkable. The taste is nice, maybe a but thin, but this is a b&t, not a stout or porter. I know they mix the premium in with this, so yeah, there's your thinness, but I really dont care. The taste is there and for being so dark, the beer sits well. This is the perfect beer for evenings, football, and for enojying with company. Delicious, and nothing else to say.","99bottles","Jul 23, 2003"

Roasted malts a slight hint of chocolate and some hops are present. The taste is the roasted malt up front with a bit bite of bitterness at the end. A nice mix of the malt and hops. I could enjoy quite a few of these. Very nicely done.","Stubbie1","Jun 06, 2003"

So it is most definitely the best bang for your buck in New England, or however far Yuengling's distribution reaches. I'm not sure if it fits the traditional black and tan role, but regardless, it's one good beer. Dark, bitter, and smooth.

3.53,9.6,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"Yuengling's Black & Tan consists of a 60%-40% mixture of the regional brewer's porter and premium beers. While a stout would have made the B & T even better (and mixing the porter with the Chesterfield Ale actually makes a tastier drink, IMO), this formula allows for a pretty decent beer. From the bottle, it poured a very dark color with hints of red. The small head, quite fluffy at first, disappeared quickly. A very subdued fruity odor was masked by a slightly stronger, but still fairly weak caramel malt scent. Tasty chocolate / roasted malt clearly dominated, but some bitterness made an appearance. Good overall balance, and I kind of enjoyed the malty sweetness in the aftertaste. The beer was a bit thin, however. The medium-to-lighter body really could be filled out a bit more. Still, the B & T is a good standby. For a slightly heavier beer, this won't fill you up too quickly, and will even save some room for a couple more. Maybe that's what Yuengling had in mind.","SchmichaelJ","Apr 14, 2003"

I hear that the tap version is a bit better (I never tried it at the restaurant), and I also hear the pure, unadulterated version (the Porter) is much better. I will make it a point to try both, and in the meantime I would recommend this with some good ol' hamburgers.","Beastdog75","Mar 20, 2003"
2.94,-8.7,4,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a deep mahogany color, with a thick tan head that gradually fades to a thin layer of foam. The aroma is very faint, with just a touch of caramel malts. That's about it for the aroma. The taste is a hint of roasted flavor and just a touch of sweetness, followed by a restrained bitterness on the finish. Again, nothing particularly outstanding, although a bit more caramel taste comes through as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is average, with decent carbonation and a smooth profile. The drinkability is also average, as the odd roasted bitterness that lingers around in the aftertaste starts to wear on you after a while. Overall, a decent beer from a good regional brewery. Not a flavorful as I remember. Could Yuengling be toning down their beers to appeal to the masses? Can't say, but I can say that this beer would suit many of them just fine. As for me, I doubt I'll have it again any time soon.","aaronh","Mar 12, 2003"

3.21,-0.3,3.5,2.5,3,3,4.5,"This beer is not great but I seem to come back to it quite often. Regionally, it is often the only dark beer that is available for drinking. It has a bitter, grassy smell that continues through the taste. The head is very thin and leaves only a little lacing on the glass. It pours very dark brown with lots of red showing through. There is a good hopiness to the beer but there seems to be some corn taste that overpowers the hops. This is their Dark-brewed Porter, which is one of my all-time favorite Porters, and their Premium, which is truly terrible, mixed together. Knowing this, I always choose the Porter over the Black and Tan when it is available. This beer is decent but definitely not well-thought out. I have made Yuengling Black and Tan with the Porter and the Lager and it is much better. Try it if those two are available in your area.","Maestro","Feb 23, 2003"

It poured a dark brown, on the verge of black. Taste and smell of roasted malts and a hoppy flavor that disapated in a instant. Not a good beer, not a bad beer either. I have had worst, but, I've had better also! I rated this low only because its in a can and I can taste that in a beer!","BeerManDan","Feb 21, 2003"

Not very heavy, and I felt it tasted very similar to Yuengling's porter, meaning also that I found it a tad thin as well. Nice mild hop bitterness precedes the dry finish.

Color is a ruby tinted blackish brown. Flavor is heavier on the porter side than lager. Roasted malts are primary flavor with a sweet aftertaste from the lager. Mouthfeel is nice but much better on tap. Can drink a lot of these but have to let off a few burbs--pretty carbonated.","allboutbierge","Dec 05, 2002"
3.08,-4.3,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"However, it's still a pretty descent brew when you want something with a bit of character, drinkable and its best attribute, CHEAP.  It has a nice dark brown-red color with a descent, if short lived, tannish head.  Taste is clearly Yuengling, and starts off being very close to the lager in overall flavor. You realize it's a different beer in the middle palate when you pick up some roasty character and some burnt sugar sweetness.  The finish is quick and not altogether smooth, but not objectionable either.  Overall light mouthfeel and flavor wise a bit light as well.  A good introduction to porters and stouts.  Nice, but definitely not a heavy hitter.","bmills1608","Nov 14, 2002"

The flavor has a slight bitterness intially, which turns semi-sweet.  The porter is very well defined.  Where's the chocolate?  The flavor was good, but a little too weak and the body is a tad too thin.  Plenty of carbonation.  A light bitter-sweet, dry, astringent finish.  Nevertheless, not a bad beer, easy to drink, and at around eight bucks a 12 pack, it is a good buy.","ThreePistols","Aug 24, 2002"

Lot of chocolate in nose. Unfortunately, the beer is better on the table than in the mouth. Only hint of that chocolate in taste. Overly astringent, particularly in aftertaste.  Very thin. Porter/Premium Lager mix. They probably should have used their Traditional Lager. Personal preference for Black & Tan: Guinness Draught and Sam Adams Boston Lager, which I call an Irish American.","RonfromJersey","Jul 02, 2002"

Dark in appearance (I've never seen the separation between the porter and the lager), not altogether unappealing. Slightly malty aromas, with a bit of chocolate (the porter is definitely more prevalent). Taste is like a rather light porter, with toned down chocolate and some burnt dark fruit. Finishes slightly bitter, but balanced. Its lightness makes it rather drinkable, if not necessarily memorable.","mophie","May 20, 2002"
