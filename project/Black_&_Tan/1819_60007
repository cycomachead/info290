3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Brown with red highlights, with an off white head with fair retention and lacing. Smells and tastes like caramel, dark roasted malt, and bread. A bit thin and watery, with decent carbonation. Not much aftertaste. Not much to get excited about, but not bad either.","hardy008","Mar 05, 2012"

3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Pour was lighter side of brown with a slight ruddy tint. Not a lot of head, and lacked lacing. Smell was lightly malty. Taste was similarly malty with a mild sweetness that finished crisp and dry enough not to be annoyingly sweet. Light body. Drinkable. Average.","JackieTH","Nov 23, 2011"

3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"The Two Pull was an interesting combination between the Northern Lights and the Brother Benedict Bock. The combination made for a decent tasting beer. I appearance was average lighter clear amber, not much head and no lace. The smell was a maltier version of the Northern Lights Lager. The taste was much better than the Bock by itsself. The Lager helped to smooth out the heavy grain/barley taste of the Bock. Mouthfeel was good the Bock gave the beer a little body and the lager made teh beer drinakable. Overall it was ok. teh IPA was much better.","WoodBrew","Jul 14, 2010"
4,21.6,4,4,4,4,4,"just thought that I would add a few things. here in my city the two pull varies depending on who pours it. varying amounts of the 2 flavors greatly change the taste/drinkability. but overall its a solid choice for me. and at $6 on tues and thurs you cant go wrong with the cost either","nllahman","Jul 11, 2010"

3.45,4.9,3,3,3.5,2.5,4.5,"O: A good beer for a chain brewpub. It won't blow you away, but I would choose this over the likes of your typical macrobrew. I go to Granite City for the food, but I enjoy Two Pulls while I'm there.","dpnelson1978","May 18, 2005"
4.1,24.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall, I am surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. Very easy drinking, yet full of flavor. The 25 oz mug went fast. Give this one a try when you are visiting.","mothman","Beers"
