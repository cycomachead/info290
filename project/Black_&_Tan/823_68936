3.46,-16.2,4,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Overall this was a unique beer and certainly the rum barrel adds vanilla and sweetness that sets it apart from boubon barrel aged beers. The barrel overpowers the beer a bit and it is perhaps a bit boozy, but at 12% what do you expect?","Smoke","Jan 08, 2013"

4.51,9.2,3.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Black & Tan? Really? I don;t see that from my meager experiences with Guinness and Bass. This stuff is far supperior I'm happy to report, a whole nother category. A solid dark brown color with a fair light tan head with streaky modest lacing. The aroma brings out big time caramel chocolate, vanilla toffee and sweet prune over nutty peat. Wow - Home Run for the nostrils. The flavor is another heavy hitter bringing out deep dark fruits with a maple-vanilla sweetness and a caramel touch. I get some root beer and fermented licorice. This is a chewy beer in flavor but the body is more of a medium light deal with a bit of a syrupy touch that is nicely cut by an active carbonation. Just a delightful dark brew full of sweet and earthy goodies that will put a smile on your face. Awesome brew!","Durge","Apr 29, 2012"

Its not a bad beer but for $12.99 it wont be in my fridge again. This is a one and done for me.","HopsHopenstein","Dec 26, 2011"

4.14,0.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"16.9oz swingtop bottle. Pours a very dark brown color with an inch of tan frothy head. Lots ofof lacing. Aroma is boozey with some vanilla, coffee, oak, whiskey and earthiness. A lot going on here. Taste is vanilla and some whiskey and oak up front. Some of the chocolate and earthy flavors towards the end. Vanilla oakiness throughout. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Almost like its a boozey vanilla and coffee milkshake. Very sweet, but the booze balances it out somewhat. The little card that came with this beer says it is an Imperial Black and Tan, and I am on board with that. At 11.99 plus 1.50 deposit this is a pretty pricey beer. However, the higher abv and the solid taste make it more justifiable. Overall, I wouldn't buy it all the time, but once or so a year would be perfect. Solid beer.","PicoPapa","Nov 05, 2011"
