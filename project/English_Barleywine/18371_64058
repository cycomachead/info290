I believe this beer could be aged due to the higher amount of carbonation and to settle down some attributes to the beer.","Alohaneen","Mar 02, 2015"

4.2,3.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.25,"Bought at Table & Vine in West Springfield. Thick black-brown appearance with some hints of red in the light. Thick head when poured, but it dissipated eventually leaving some nice lacing on the sides. Aromas are very sweet with distinct flavors of malts, dried fruit like raisins, nuts, toffee, and alcohol. The drink definitely had a sugary-fruit taste mixed with toffee leading to a bittersweet drink with a sharp bite of alcohol in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a good carbonation and helps to give the drink a  crisp, creamy feel. Overall, a fantastic drink.","fitzy84","Jan 31, 2015"

Indeed, cellaring has mellowed this beast out, and it is now extremely smooth, fruity, and delicious. Unquestionably a barley wine, and a great one at that. Immediately upon opening the bottle the aroma smacked me in the face with an entire fruit cake. Raisins and plums, but also over-ripe pears, apricots, dates, and a hint of treacle.

It tastes like caramel, toffee, dark bread, dark fruit, wood, and some brandy. It's a nice, sweet malty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation.

4.25,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Reviewed from notes. Pours a deep auburn/crimson with nice clarity and minimal head. The smell has waves of raisin, caramel, maple, and some mild hop character. The taste is malt forward with a nice caramel sweetness and a great balance. Robust favors with touches of dark fruit, toffee, honey, and just the right amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. Overall, this is a well crafted barleywine ith delicate flavored that work quite well.","homebrew311","Mar 26, 2013"

4.02,-0.7,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Served properly into a PT OFR stem glass, a deep garnet brown color, not quite opaque, very effervescent, and topped with a small, creamy tan head that stayed small, but retained forever and left streaks of lacing on the glass. The nose was malty, nutty, caramel, and slightly woody. Taste was similar, bready, nutty, toasted grains, caramel malts, hints of old raisins, brown sugar, herbal hops, and a stiff, woody finish. Booze was felt, but pretty well-hidden, taste-wise. Body was medium, smooth mouthfeel, even if slightly higher in carbonation that I'd have expected. Careful pouring: it's very yeasty towards the bottom, and I could swear the yeast was actually still active. Nice beer overall.","Rifugium","Mar 03, 2013"

A lot of caramel and vanilla with intense malt flavors. Raisins, dates, plums, and English malt and hops with a nice, warming boozy finish.

4.1,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark, very clear caramel hue. The head is reduced to a collar after a short while. Smells of brown sugar, dried earthy fruit, toffee. Some alcohol too, but it's surprisingly reserved given the high ABV. The palate closely resembles the nose, highlighting flavors of dried fruit, apricot, berry preserves and toffee. Nice fruitiness from the yeast, though it's a clean and malt-forward beer overall. Medium in body, could use a touch more viscosity. I enjoyed this quite a bit, though I think some gentle oxidation would give the beer more depth. Wish I had another bottle to age for a couple years.","largadeer","Jan 25, 2011"

Aroma is of cherries, bubble gum, laffy taffy, apples, smells like candy...raisins, tons of character and very inviting, with a touch of alcohol presence. Taste if of sweet malts, taffy, cherries, vanilla extract, figs, not very hoppy at all....dont look for balance here. Gets a little cloying after half the bomber is gone. This is definitely a beer with a high potential for aging.","Doomcifer","Dec 30, 2010"

4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle served in my Duck-Rabbit snifter. Winter 2010/2011 vintage. Pours a plum-like hue with a semi-hazy clarity. Head is creamy/frothy, off-white and approximately half an inch in height. Head eventually settles into a thin skim with a thick band around the shoulders. Some strands of lacing evident during the tasting. Nose reveals dark candied fruit, unrefined sugar and an intermingling of alcohol, without expressing heat or an overly caustic character. Taste consistent with nose; however some caramel notes come out in the flavor profile, and a slightly spicy quality is detectable at the finish. A light alcohol presence is expressed, but it is fairly subdued and seems to nicely intermingle with a light bittering hops flavor that helps keep the brew from being cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a carbonation level that falls just short of lively. Texture is a bit oily across the tongue and some residual alcohol heat comes out and lightly lingers at the finish. This is an incredibly drinkable barleywine right out of the bottle. Heat is minimal and the abv is deceptively hidden. A great beer to crack open on a cold winter's day. Well worth your time if you have the opportunity to try it.","Jwale73","Dec 26, 2010"

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"I first tried this at the Otherside Cafe in Boston. It came out in a tulip which displays the deep amber tone well and shows off its very aromatic, fruity scent. At first taste it's a smooth, malty almost syrupy texture. They are very fond of their barley blends on this one and you definitely get that. It's a warm, spicy brew. It carries a festive fruity flavor that made it feel very festive for the winter holidays. I enjoyed the glass so well that I bought a bottle down the street for later!","smurder187","Dec 17, 2010"

Luckily I found this aged in the store because this is one of those beers that I don't have the will-power to age in my cellar. I tend to find it and crack it open before I've let it age properly. wonderful beer all around from one of the best breweries on the east coast.","silentjay","Dec 16, 2010"

3.65,-9.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,3,"This barleywine's flavors just never shown through past the big alcohol character. It's hard to use the word 'bland' to describe a 13.5% english barleywine, but that's the first thing that jumps to my mind; no creamy malt flavors, no rich, aged fruit, no interesting sharp alcohol flavors, etc. Maybe this one is just too young to appreciate.","NEhophead","Dec 12, 2010"
3.73,-7.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear, deep amber and slightly coppery in colour with a yellow/beige cap of mostly fine bubbles. Good head retention, particularly for the abv, with sticky lacing. Nice aroma, lots of bread, plums, raisins, alcohol, toast, toffee, slightly buttery with a hint of berries as it warms. Hops had more presence in the flavour, contributing sturdy bitterness that was just underneath the surface flavours and a bit of grassy character. Sweet malts, plums, and alcohol were dominant, with the sweetness well short of cloying. Notes of roses, berries, and figs appeared as it warmed. Heavy in body, lightish in carbonation, smooth and creamy with considerable alcohol warmth, but no strong heat. Quite tasty overall, but it left me with the impression that it could stand up to (and benefit from) a little bit of aging so that the flavours meld together a bit more. I think I'll grab a couple more of these for the cellar.","DrJay","Dec 10, 2010"

3.34,-17.5,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"I haven't had a single sip of beer this week (unusual for me) so I decided to reward myself tonight with something that packs a punch. Our Finest Regards pours out a beautiful rose color, with a creamy two inches of white heading. A big perfume of alcohol hits immediately as it warms, followed by some stone fruits. Similar taste as there is with the nose, but there is an undercurrent of brown sugar and molasses to be had that reminds me of some of my favorites from this style. Body is not as big as the ABV suggests, but with that being said, it is one to share with others. Although I like the fact that this is a Barleywine with lots of unsympathetic alcohol content and flavor, I would imagine this is going to be even better with two to three years of age on it. A true Winter Warmer we have here from Pretty Things. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 02, 2010"
