4.2,-5.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring pretty quickly. Some minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, bourbon, oak, light vanilla, light tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, light vanilla, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a small-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged English barelywine style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and fairly smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, but I feel that the base beer is more impressive than this one.","superspak","Feb 28, 2015"

You really have to sit down, sip, and savor this one.  With a 14% bill, sipping and relishing should probably be part of the option anyway.  The Pelican is a heck of a brewery, and this is way more than a heck of a brew.  Can't wait to taste my other bottle in a couple of years or so and compare the difference.","macpapi","Feb 27, 2015"

The boozy Bourbon bite is teeth numbing dominant, while getting toned down by glazed toffee and honey, building up a great balance between wooden booziness and caramelized sweetness. Due to the surprisingly convenient balance, there are many subtle flavors detectable, such as an acrid coffee tang, resulting from the rich Bourbon, paired against toasty, glazed vanilla, getting accompanied by hazelnuts. Has a hot dryness to it during the finish, enveloping the dried fruits, sweet malts, with molasses providing a long lasting aftertaste among the leathery, wooden Bourbon.","aleigator","Feb 22, 2015"

Same flavors as in the aroma, with some dark dried fruits in there as well.  Sweet, but not overly sweet.  Exceptionally smooth, hides its alcohol well (though clearly a sipper).

Contrasting against some of these whales that may taste the same as its top-tiered brethren stylistically, this is a sure standout for barleywines. As soon as you open the bottle, the aromas hit the room from corner to corner, enticing you with every breath. The flavoring is extremely pure and full, with absolutely nothing offensive about it. There is almost no aftertaste, due in part to the thick coating of sugar left around the mouth, but more so due to the fact that the blend is so utterly perfected. If you’ve had Westy 12 you’ll know what we mean when we say that this should be the basic prototype for the style. There are no bells or whistles you’re not expecting, but rather you are presented with something so pure and unabashed. We keep using the word “pure”, but there really isn’t any other way to put it. This is one of the most palpably slow drinkers in recent memory. You don’t want to guzzle or pound because the flavoring is so amazing, but rather you want to finesse this one, and perhaps take it out for a nice seafood dinner, by candlelight, followed by a romantic ride in a horse-drawn carriage. Oh, yes. You want this experience to last forever.","TheBrewo","Jun 28, 2014"

4.16,-6.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"This is a 2012 vintage I'm drinking. Very deep brown and when the light hits it a deep red garnet color created. Initially a reddish deep brown head is formed and fades away, a thin ring remains around the class. Not surprising given the alcohol content. Aroma is jammy, with raisins. Alcohol is rather present even after two years. Some barrel presence remains. Port like. Flavor is heavy on the booze, port and sherry like flavors waft in and become heavy and prominant. Burnt caramel, raisins, and toffee mingle with the sherry and port flavors. Complex flavor, really it is, way beyond a barrel bomb. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Thick. Not cloying however. The alcohol creates a sharp and clearly burn like quality. There is no doubt this is an exceptional ale. Downsides, the alcohol keeps coming back and reminding me it is there, the burnt caramel flavor is rather strong and can be off putting, the palate is left muddy.","pmlondrigan","Apr 19, 2014"

Perhaps some more time in the cellar will allow it to mellow out a bit more and take some of the heat out of the equation. That and a less prickly feel would make this one a real winner.

Huge brown sugary caramel malty aroma with lots of deep dark fruits and bits of vanilla. coconut and wood. Sweet sugary malt flavor with a solid hit of alcohol. Dark fruits caramel prunes wood and vanilla are all there in the flavor. Hints of bourbon oak and oak tannin round out the flavor. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I've had this before and remember enjoying it a bit more. Its a nice barleywine, but I feel the alcohol is a bit too present and may need a bit of time to mellow out.","johnnnniee","Sep 01, 2013"

Good coating of the glass. Smell is inviting with some bourbon on the nose and dark fruitiness. The taste is deep. Ripe/overripe fruits creating a candy/brown sugar sweetness that enhances the oak and minor vanilla. Very, very smooth with a slick mouthfeel that is full bodied without too much heat. Great beer. Comparable to the best BA barleywines I've tasted. The key is having the body to stand up to the flavor and round out the drinking experience and this beer delivers that.","PHBoiler","Jun 30, 2013"

The beer is boozey, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. Nice sipper, lightcarbonation, full body. Very excited to try it, worth seeking out.","bonkers","Mar 31, 2013"

This is a monster of a beer - a rich array of barrel influences dominated by bourbon and oak. Brown sugar, raisins, dates, syrupy booze, thick malt.

4.58,2.9,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,"O: This is big and malty and ultra sweet. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a 14% bourbon barrel english barleywine. Wonderful beer, the only real fault I could find is when the bourbon stands alone in the aftertaste, it tastes kinda like cheapish bourbon. I'm guessing evan williams like previous vintages. Regardless, not nearly as hot as you'd expect for a fresh 14% barrel-aged barleywine, hell this bottle is barely 3 months old. Honestly, sucaba has nothing on this beer, this should be #1 handily.","Dope","Feb 26, 2013"

4,-10.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a lightly cloudy dark brown color ale with a medium size head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light whisky notes with some brown sugar, toffee and some pretty robust caramelized malt notes. Taste is a great mix between some toffee notes with some brown sugar and caramelized malt with some whisky notes which kinds of round off the rough edge. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no real apparent alcohol. Very well done but I would have like the residual sugar to be more subtle which would have provide more space for the malt backbone to shine.","Phyl21ca","Feb 25, 2013"

The retention faded and there really wasn't any lacing either but there was some viscosity on the glass after each sip. The smell of the beer wasn't as potent as I was expecting or hoping for. The beer smells sweet and earthy with some subtle booze on the nose. The taste is sweet, there is a touch of maple in there with some earthy peat but it's very hidden. The bitterness is low just a touch of it in the finish but for the most part this beer is very malty and for the right reasons. The mouthfeel is smooth, it's slick and very mellow. Not much carbonation here but just enough. Overall it was a good brew, holds up well to the style, I found it to be enjoyable.","Knapp85","Feb 19, 2013"

There appears to be active carbonation, but the bubbles don't stick around. Classic English barleywine aroma of caramel malt and dark fruit with nice bourbon and oak notes. Flavor follows with caramel malt, brown sugar, bourbon, dark dried fruit, a hint of cherry and chocolate. Finishes somewhat dry with oak and light hops. Medium bodied. Alcohol is covered but still hot and warming. A really nice English barleywine that was worth waiting for. Will lay a few bottles away for ageing, I think this will score even higher when the alcohol mellows and the flavors balance out over time.","LiquidAmber","Dec 24, 2012"

Deep and dark, yet still eerily translucent, dark brown color mixed with a glistening bloody maroon, topped with a rocky beige head that retained for a surprisingly long time, and left some soapy lacing on the glass. Complex and tantalizing aroma of dark malty sugars, molasses, juicy dark fruits, and chocolate-covered cherries. Rarely do I give "5" ratings for taste, but I can't really bring myself to rate this beer anything less. Caramel, toffee, thick malts, molasses and milk chocolate up front, a segue of almonds leading to a mid-palate cascade of raisins, figs, black cherries, sherry, brandy, red grapes, and finishing off with flavors of cigar-grade tobacco, vanilla-tinged, wood-soaked bourbon, and a deep-seated earthiness. If that weren't enough, the mouthfeel was intensely creamy and velvety smooth, full-bodied, almost too drinkable, though pretty hot from the alcohol, but you have to expect that from a beer like this. I have a few more bottles of this that I'm going to let age for a while. I'm sure they'll prove to be interesting in a few years.","Rifugium","Mar 11, 2012"

4.29,-3.6,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pelican's Mother of All Storms pours almost stout-like. The body of the beer appears to be all black, but some backlighting reveals scant cherry highlights. Nearly three fingers of foam come together to crown the beer. Head retention is somewhat fleeting though, and lacing is basically nonexistent. The nose is a little weak at first, but really starts to pop as the beer finishes warming. Strong notes of smooth bourbon and caramelized sugar are supported by a secondary aroma of vanilla. The bourbon, while still present, takes more of a back seat role in the flavor profile. Some creamy milk chocolate emerges to join the vanilla and burnt sugar hinted at in the nose. The mouthfeel is spot on, with a full, sturdy body that stops short of being syrupy. The carbonation is just enough to cut through all the malty goodness and let me know it's there, and I wouldn't want any more for it. English barleywines, and their barrel aged brethren, are some of my favorite beers, and Mother of All Storms is on of the best takes on the style I've had.","axeman9182","Mar 04, 2012"

This was still really hot, I'd like to get a bottle of this age for a while then try it in two years once it has mellowed. While it was very aggressive when I tried it, I thing it would come out very smoothly with some age. Mouthfeel id relatively thick, with mild carbonation.

Dark fruits, vanilla, and caramel in the nose. Light bourbon is detected. Flavors of dark cherries and oak vanilla. Bit of a bitter back finish. The bourbon brings out in it’s own quite smoothly.

Stone Tea, rest in peace, who lost every member in this modern age refusing to deliver tea by protocol. No; no. There was a much more insidious secret that no crew member beyond the first mate could be made aware of. This marlin galleon was commanded by none other than a pelican. To be fair, he was a completely able captain with a curse placed upon him by a Portland witch who converted his form to the omnipresent visage of fertility, well knowing that he was impotent. That, my friends, is a story for another day. Sure there was a cool pressure from one direction and another front with conflicting warm pressures and, wait, who is manning the sextant?

Both the flavor and aroma are just delicious; they are fully redolent of buttery vanilla notes, sweet oak, almond, caramel-toffee, brown rice syrup, toasted coconut, molasses and a hint of fudge.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, cream, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma were quite complex and all aspects seemed to work quite well together.

The drinkability of this one surely gets knocks for the abv% - and also for what is, relatively speaking, a pretty large amount of free sweetness - but these can't stand in the way of what is truly a remarkably complex and amazing brew.

Because, I don't care how well the alcohol is hidden for the ABV percentage, at some point, you usually are still going to be tasting quite a bit of alcohol, and the drinkability will consequently be hampered quite a bit regardless of relative ABV and style considerations. I make an exception, today, for The Perfect Storm, because, well, The Perfect Storm is EXTREMELY drinkable for its ABV, with little to no alcohol heat (and on top of that, tastes delicious). I want to drink this one all night, and extremely glad to be splitting this one with CrellMoset, who is almost certainly saving me from drinking to excess this evening. Pick this up by any means necessary.

The taste loads up on sugary sweets, treacle, toffee, with a maple and earthiness to it, and a big bourbon bite that I enjoy. I do like this, though as far as bourbon barrel barleywines go, this is fairly typical in taste.

Loose, white head quickly dissipates into barely a swirl. Incredible nose - malty, sugary sweet, toffee, butterscotch, a little booze, molasses, prunes and perhaps a little breadiness. Taste follows nose - sugary sweet with the addition of some caramel, vanilla and coconut. Mouthfeel is medium with a lively carbonation. Definitely a little booziness in this, but a big, bold and delicious beer. However, closer to an American Strong than an English barleywine in my humble opinion.","Jwale73","Jan 10, 2010"

Smells and tastes amazing - tons of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, raisins, dark fruits, wood, and alcoholic heat. This really is liquid toffee. Reminds me a bit of FW Abacus or FW 10. An amazing wood-aged barleywine. Body is super thick, but the carbonation slices through it to prevent syrupification. I started out the gate strong in downing this, but am hitting a wall as I near the end of the bottle, so drinkability takes a bit of a hit.

The aroma has a lot of bourbon influence and barrel character, like this spent some quality time on wood. Dark burnt sugars, charred oak, burnt vanilla, caramel, alcohol and old wood. The flavor is very hot with lots of bourbon, dark caramel, bunt fruit and charred wood. The finish is almost pure alcohol and very rich. The mouthfeel is very hot and alcoholic, full, and has a modest amount of prickly carbonation. A very big beer that is not very smooth at this point and could use a lot of time to mellow out. Dark and burnt for a barleywine. They really went for it with maximum barrel extraction, but it looks like its going to take a lot of time to really mellow back out.","bulletrain76","Dec 06, 2009"
3.24,-27.2,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Bottle courtesy Joel. Pours a gorgeous shimmering copper color with a fading beige head. Aroma is sharp bourbon, lots of heat here, charred oak, vanilla. This is more bourbony than any barrel-aged beer I've had. Over the top. Flavor is caramel and bourbon, vanilla, leather, and wood. I don't know if I'm drinking beer or if a plane dropped a barrel on my face. Needs a lot of age to gain a modicum of drinkability. Also rather thin from the spirit influence.","illidurit","Dec 06, 2009"

4.8,7.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Nice soft carbonation up front with a medium body that's on the fuller end. Promient oaky tannis and a huge vanilla character from the oak aging. The bourbon is ore prominent in the flavor than in the aroma but again it isn't overpowering but rather is a nice compliment to the other complex flavors. There's also a bit of dark fruit, especially raisin, fig and date balancing out the earthy leathery malt notes. The bourbon presence provides a bit of alcohol warmth but this beer is dangerously drinkable considering how well the high ABV is masked. Extremely smooth and if I didn't share this bottle with some other BAs I would have probably killed myself by drinking it too fast.

Thus giving the ale a wonderful creaminess and balance it didn't have before (I didn't realize this until I did a side-by-side tasting). Big notes of vanilla, caramel , prunes, raisins, and a little bourbon makes this years batch worth every drop. I have to give a standing ovation to Pelican for taking TPS up a notch. They have been producing some amazing beers under the radar and TPS is the cream of the crop. Great World Class Beer!!!","Dajtai007","Nov 30, 2009"
4.75,6.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This is definitely a sipper, it has a thick boozy mouthfeel and the warming sensation in the stomach starts almost instantly with this brew. The carbonation is light, but spot on for the style, and adds just enough to make the beer more complex. The finish is incredible and surprisingly dry, not sweet and boozy at all.

Alcohol heat hints at a beer below 10%, rather than the high 13.5%. The fruit component is reminiscent of dates. The beer finishes refreshingly dry with some noticeable heat and a whisper of soy sauce and sherry. The beer has a low level of carbonation that works very well.
