It was so sweet and had just a hint of dark fruit in it while leaving a nice, slick aftertaste that the potency of this ended up taking a backseat. It's so rare to find a beer that pushes the edge of what a beer can be while still remaining true to form, which was the case here.

Smells insanely sweet of toffee and fruit. I've not had an English barleywine where the dessert-cake aspect was so intense. Massive cocoa and fruitcake and oh so much more accompany the consistent ring of lacing that follows the 9.25 oz. or whatever to the bottom of the glass. Alcohol hardly noticeable, a fine beer completely different than anything I've ever had. The one I'd recommend to illustrate the difference between an English and American take on what a barleywine ale is...","matt_duthie","Nov 01, 2014"

I trust that Little's cellared this beer properly so I don't think that is the issue. I wouldn't buy this beer again at its price (10$ for less than 10oz), but I'm still glad I experienced this old of a brew. To date this is the oldest aged beer I have ever tasted. After submitting (usually only check rating after reviewing) there seems to be a ton of pDev on this beer, probably due to pushing it past it's limits. Maybe this beer is only meant to be set aside for a couple of years and not a half to a whole decade... just my two cents. I guess I also questions J.W. Lees, I know brewing over seas is based more on tradition, but why not try waxing or corking a beer that everyone is so eager to age... again just my two cents. The smell and initial taste are great, the finish is not, which kinda spoils the beer, which is unfortunate cause I can imagine how awesome this beer could be.","minterro","Jan 31, 2014"

It really depends on how much such things bother you as far as which style of pour to utilize, I suppose. Color was a murky, deep-amber with loads of evident floaties. Nose was enough to make me want to pay homage to my sinuses for finally clearing up. Holy dried dark fruit, Batman! This smelled of raisins, prunes, worn leather, tobacco, a newspaper mustiness and alcohol heat. Jeezus. My first sip was thick and viscous and sat on my tongue like a big glob of something that I might not want to swallow. The taste was sweet and smoky and my first thought was "S. Clyde Weaver's Sweet Lebanon Bologna". Finish was still sweet and smoky, but now with a tobacco-like smokiness, like I had partaken of a stogie. Double Jeezus.

Aroma is a very volatile blend of caramel, yeast, malt, dark ripe fruit, raisins, bread dough, and seemingly many other things. Flavor's like nose, with sweet out front along with, curiously, a little chili pepper, bitter a little behind that and just a smidgen of carbonic tang. Body is full and lush with some little bitter points that just contribute to the beautiful picture. Carbonation is a little tame, but it works.

Pours a murky dark brown color with a small dark khaki head with decent retention that reduces to a ring of lace as expected. Some slight bits of lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, molasses, biscuit, wood, toffee, raisin, earth, whiskey, chocolate, and light herbal. Damn nice aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of HUGE caramel, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, wood, raisin, butterscotch, chocolate, biscuit, honey, and slight herbal hops. Lingering notes of molasses, caramel, toffee, raisin, honey, and butterscotch on the finish for a good while. Insane complexity, balance, and smoothness; with no cloying sweetness at all; despite this being a 100% malty beer. Light carbonation and full bodied; with an absolutely beautiful creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with no warming noticed at all. Definitely a sipper, but I can’t even consider drinking this fast at all. Overall this is an absolutely mind blowing barely wine that was pushing 10 years old. I will not turn down purchasing older vintages of this in the future. Absolutely fantastic.","superspak","Apr 18, 2012"

First taste was almost like sipping on some extremely sweet golden raisiin cough syrup but it was mellow going down and was pleasant with no veracious alcohol taste which is normally a good sign with barley wines that they have aged long enough. Couple more sips and i got more fruit and almost vanilla flavor out of it and an aftertaste of apricots in the back of my mouth.

Does not have any head to speak of. Taste is intense, but mellow at the same time. Strong presence of fruit soaked in brandy here. Bartender served it warm, and it was perfect at room temperature.

Leather, fruits, spices, aged maple syrups, and the list goes on. The craziest thing about this beer is that I think this thing has not even come close to peaking. What I am tasting is progression, and by no means completion. This is a beer to sit on for years, and then open it to witness its glory. Truly a memorable beer, I need to try more aged barley wines.","Cavery","Jul 22, 2011"

4.54,7.1,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"A few months back this bottle mysteriously appeared on the shelf and found its way home with me. Pours a muddy brown color with a minimal tan head that forms a ring on the top. This smells great! Sherry and toffee mixed with some brown sugar and a touch of alcohol to keep it from smelling too sweet. Caramel and dark dried fruit with a slightly earthy aroma round out the nose quite nicely. Taste is sweet up front with brown sugar and dark fruit coming in first. Hints of sherry and earthiness hit before the palette goes almost completely dry. Finish leaves a long lingering molasses prune sweetness that is offset nicely with a touch of alcohol. Big thick body with a surprisingly dry finish. Light level of bubbles, sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I am a sucker for an aged barleywine, and this one really impressed me, this is a beautifully aged beer. Now the regret sets in when I realize that I only bought one bottle.","johnnnniee","Jul 16, 2011"

4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured out as a pretty nice looking murky golden amber color. The head is nonexistent, no lacing here either. The smell of the beer has a lot of wood on the nose, and plenty of boozy sweetness to it. Has a strong malty aroma too. The taste of the beer is sweet throughout, the flavors of honey and some spice. The flavors are very strong which makes this beer a sipper, this beer needs to be enjoyed in moderation over a long cold night. The mouthfeel is thick and has no carbonation.

Aroma is very sweet and fruity, lots of big malts coming through with a heavy dose of dark fruits, sweet toffee and some prune and plum characteristics. Tastes rich with maple and oaky notes in the start along with the dark overripe fruits. Very sweet from on set to finish, barely any hops present tiny bitterness in the finish. Boozy but blends perfectly like a nice port. Very rich full sticky body and almost no carbonation. Not my style but glad to have tried this one out!

4.83,13.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Bottle opens with a tiny pffft indicating an undercarbed barleywine, but the pour shows otherwise. Light carbonation, but a nice fizzy head does form before vanishing. The aroma is somewhat less integrated than the two previous vintages, even at 11 years in the bottle. Caramel apple, dates, brown sugar, and some molasses. On the palate, the caramel sweetness is especially notable, bordering on candy-like. Deep fruity notes complement brown sugar and molasses in the finish, with just a touch of vanilla and some sherry-nuanced oxidation. Slick and oily, but smooth and lush on the palate. The candy-like sweetness is somewhat tempered by the vanilla and fruit notes, balancing this nicely. This is my second favorite vintage overall behind the '98.","NittanyBeerFan","Apr 25, 2011"

But longer. Settling after about 8 seconds. Nose pollen, whiskey malt, old furniture and subtle banana. A palate of sweet honey in a transition of floral to thisle bitter earth. There is a nice tang in the finish. A baltic porter hint. A finish of pomagrante earth bitter seeds and hints of lingering toasted sesame. A wonderful earth note in the cask.","rtepiak","Apr 20, 2011"

4.7,10.8,4,4,5,5,5,"Light brown beer, off white head. Not overly sweet nor dry. Reasonable head retention for a barley wine. Smooth malty caramel toffee notes. Alcohol is warming not burning. I might be able to taste a bit of oak. Mild but apparent bitterness. Very slight yeast character. It seems like a very simple recipe. Nice grain flavor mixed with Kent golding and an English yeast.

4.39,3.5,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pour a beautiful ruby amber color that you can see through like the gem it's named for. The attempt at pouring so there may be head was only met with large agitation bubbles as this beer had no intention of having or retaining head. The aromatics smelled wonderful. There were to many aromas to name. A list of the major ones would include: raisin, fig, butterscotch, honey, caramel, vanilla, and a touch of raspberry. The caramel flavor translated over into the taste most prominently. The amazing thing about this beer is that dark raisin flavor is almost on par with some of the better Port wines I've had. When this beer hits the right temperature it tastes pretty darn good. But at a bit too cold it was a little off and a bit too warm it was a bit fumy. Overall I really did enjoy this beer, I would say that I'm also rather fond of this style. I wish I could see what one with even more than 5 years on it tastes like.","Vdubb86","Apr 06, 2011"

Figs, rich desserts, chocolate, melons, and a nice grainy note. No hint of hops left, the alcohol provides as much bitter dryness as the IBU's.

Bitterness is not noticeably present, but the beer is not cloying and perfectly balanced. There is some slight oxidation which probably improves this beer.

On the nose the two predominant notes are a very distinct mint and biscuit. On the tongue there is a huge malt sweetness. It's not overpowering by any means, just huge. At the end there is a note of alcohol, not surprising given the content here. In the mouth this beer is syrupy and cloying, pretty large. The alcohol content and price conspire to make this one not something to drink lots of, but it paired wonderfully with a rare ribeye tonight and for that sort of purpose it's a great drink.","EricCioe","Oct 24, 2010"

I know Nate mentioned some of these beers were vintage and this smells the part completely. Flavor is mellow chocolate malts and a nice strong alcohol taste. Very similar to a blend of milk and bitter chocolate with a hint of almond or . I'm having to resist inhaling this beer, its great.

Pours a semi-hazy mahogany with a slick of a head that quickly dissipates into broken spots and a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some light, spots and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose is sweet - maple syrup, toffee, prunes, figs and a slightly boozy quality on a malty/bready backbone. Taste consistent with nose - wow this is amazing. Sweet and fruity and the alcohol all but disappears; dangerous for an 11.5% brew. The distinctive aromas in the nose really coalesce nicely in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a light carbonation and a slightly oily quality to the texture. What an amazing barelywine. The price is a little steep at $8.00 a bottle but what an exceptional treat.

I can't fault the beer too much for that though, it is eleven years old after all. The nose is great, toffee and alcohol soaked fruits and a hint of wet cardboard from the inevitable oxidation. The flavor is an exact duplicate, with a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. I've never had a fresh Harvest Ale, but it's beautiful with a decade plus of age on it. The body on this is incredibly rich and full, and the lessened carbonation leads to ultimately a very smooth and velvety mouthfeel. A phenomenal flavor and solid mouthfeel make this vintage gem very drinkable. I'm just cringing now at the thought that I only bought two bottles of this magic elixer","axeman9182","Sep 10, 2010"

A finger of yellowish tan foam for a head appears quite silky in appearance and receeds to just a thin film across the top of the beer. Spotty amounts of lace cling all around the glass. Aroma of this beer opens up big and boozy like sherry but eventually gives way to notes of molasses, brown sugar, oak-like woodsyness and some raisins soaked in alcohol. Taste is an impressive display of how a beer can fight the ages. For nearly 12 years old this beer has really held it's own. A slight touch of oxidation is present but adds to the complex monster of malt characteristics. My mouth is on sensory overload with this beer. Flavors of oak and smoke showcase the toasty side of the malt profile whereas flavors of prunes and raisins balance out the sweeter side before the hops bring in the bitterness. Feel of this beer boarderlines being syrupy but still very smooth and lightly carbonated. The aftertaste includes some flavors similar to coffee, chocolate, spice like cinamon and toffee.

Dark mahogany body, a frothy head the color of french vanilla coffee that lasts, tilt the snifter and the whole 3 finger head moves with it and the cascading effect when tilted looks like whitewater rapids in slow motion, like the bottom of a crashing waterfall. The nose was shocking being it contains a very hefty peppermint aroma. It warms you when smelled, like a minty honey liquor. Very tasty stuff, very complex, no mint in the taste but you still get a whiff every time you raise the glass. Brown sugar, caramel, honey drizzled pralines, white raisin insides and butterscotch all beg to be savored with each sip. Man I wish I had more. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and silky. One of if not THE smoothest mouthfeel I've come across. Very understated carbonation almost like it isn't carbonated, just enough bubbles to sniff perfection.

A bit salty and peppery and sort of like teriyaki sauce. Brown sugar is present and a brown bread malt. The brew has a full body, a bit thick and almost syrupy.

The taste is super sweet with a slight bitter mustiness at the tail end - reminds me of my grandparent's basement. This has been the same for all JW HA's that I've had - kind of disappointing. The mouth feel is on the more viscous side and would improve greatly if there were any carbonation in it.

Very fruity, with a pronounced raisin and plum character. Nutty, caramelized chocolatey malt. Very light carbonation, barely present, with a thick, syrupy body. Less earthy than the 1996 bottling, and more fruity. The flavors are better integrated, coming together in a seamless package. Very nice.","UnionMade","Feb 10, 2009"
3.33,-21.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice clear coppery amber with a fairly thick but not too persistent pale tan head. Aroma is crisp and fruity, mainly of sweet apple, more like a cider than a beer. Strong alcohol bite overwhelms the rather sweet, fruity flavor, so it is rather like drinking brandy mixed with fruit juice. Flavor does have a hint of malt and a hint of hops, but is somehow not really beer-like; nevertheless it is acceptable, if not my cup of tea, er, ale. Texture is syrupy, smooth and thick, yet edgy thanks to the strong bite of alcohol. It leaves a rather sweet aftertaste coupled with some alcohol and hop bitterness.","Cyberkedi","Feb 05, 2009"

However, with some agitation a fine film can be produced. There doesn't appear to be much carbonation. I understand that most of these observations could be due in large part to being aged for five years. The nose is very strong and can be picked up from a few feet away. Smells of candied/carameled dried fruit, figs, apricots, prunes. Some alcohol is detectable in the nose as well. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly viscous. The taste is very similar to the nose except that there is a brief and subtle amount of earthy hops in the begining and near the end.

Well, the smell was pretty strong, not really in the best of ways. The sweetness continues in the flavor. My reaction would have been classic if I was on video. Just a bit of a cringe comes from the flavor here. Maple syrupy and and fruity sweetness. Big toffee and caramel. All soaked in booze. Mouthfeel is full, thick and chewy. It is strongly hurt by the cloying sweetness of the beer, however. If not for that it would be sublime. No way I can drink this beer. I'm giving it sip after sip, minute after minute.

High alcohol, gasoline, oak and bourbon on the nose- who knows what else. Taste was strong as hell. Lots of whiskey or bourbon, some oak, some smoke and a whole lot of alcohol.

Aromas you can smell all the way across the room. Incredible spicy, caramel malt, with huge swirling dried fruits in there, also cherries and a dose of vinous wine-iness. A touch of alcohol, mixed in with solid breadiness. Huge delicious aroma (although not a hop in sight. Flavor is...oh good Christ this is something. Hugely bready and full; the body is incredibly creamy and syrupy, clinging to your mouth for a minute. Very mildly carbonated (possibly cause of the age), but it works perfectly for that syrupy sweet flavor (and I mean that in a good way). Other flavors are tons of maple syrup, tons of sweet caramel malt, lightly spiced. Cookies, chocolate...the flavors are innumerable. Really outstanding. Not sure what more I can say.

4.22,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"From a 9.6 ounce bottle into a snifter. Pours an opaque mahogony with a thin tan head that lines the edge of the glass but otherwise dissipates into a fairy nonexistent covering. Little lacing is left behind, which makes sense to the 11.5% ABV. Unbelievably rich, malty aroma of sweet pumpernickel, rum soaked dark fruits (dates?), rising dough, and an alcohol note that is reminiscent of tripel sec, sweet cognacs. Taste of sweet doughy bread, with rum soaked raisins and oak chips and a lingering brown sugar and molasses finish. It tastes like a holiday bread...with booze. You can smell the alcohol in the air, but is it entirely undistinguishable in the taste. This is most definitely a long sipper, not because of the booziness but because of how rich the malt profile is. I now know what a true english barleywine is, and I'm not going to say I dislike, but its quite a different exercise for the palette. A very interesting beer, and I can clearly see how the aging process works after this brew","beavers","Apr 02, 2008"

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber/red color with a 1/4 inch off-white head. Not much head retention or lacing. It smells like prunes, sherry/port, brown sugar and molasses. It's a very sweet aroma. Taste is exactly like the aroma, fruity and sweet, very nice. Alcohol isn't as hot in the aroma or taste as I'd thought it would be, it's pretty mellow. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, slick and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and goes down easy. It's a sipping beer, but it's pretty easy to drink it quicker than I should! I could drink 2 or 3 (at most) of these in a sitting. I think this is a very good beer, no wonder it's on the BA Top 100.

Some roastiness. a decadent taste experience. Full bodied and heavy. Yeah, this is a great drinking experience. very nice.

Fruit (apples, berries, dates), coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, nut, toasty... Wow, so many flavors at so many times of the sip in this one. Alcohol plays a role, but is very mellow and is more of a warming presence. Thick, viscous, full, smooth mouthfeel.

The caramel character is nothing short of spectacular and even though it is a very sweet beer it somehow avoids becoming cloying. Despite nearly 10 years in the bottle it shows no signs of oxidation, and has very little of the sherry character that one might expect of a beer this age.

Taste has some of that wortiness up front, but it really works as it smoothly morphs into loads of caramel, toffee, honey, maple syrup, oranges, almonds, plums, raisins, dates, and crusty, rustic bread. Finishes extremely sweet with a return of the grainy wort flavor, a touch of tartness and some roasted malt, which continues to linger on. There is really no hop bitterness here, rather just a slight hint of tea-like hops in the middle to end. Mouthfeel is full, thick, viscous, sticky, and hardly carbonated.

The smell was dominated by raisins and a syrupy sugary sweetness. Not a fan of the overly sweet raisins that I've run across before this one and didn't like it here. The taste was way too sweet to be enjoyable for me. Was like drinking sugar water with a bunch of raisins thrown in. This is my 2nd barley wine and not looking to try another unless part of my Top 100 quest. Don't recommend unless you like the style or very sweet beers. (1.5, NA, ML, N)","TexIndy","Jul 01, 2007"

The smell is very earthy, but does not allude at all to how big this beer is gonna be. The taste is very large, and the lack of any carbonation really lets it sit and develop on the tongue. The consistency is almost like molasses, and you can tell that there is not much more in this beer than extract and water. Very little hop character, but the sheer size of the malt seem to provide a sufficient size for the whole tongue. Also there is absolutely no alcohol taste, which means this beer goes down fast and creeps up on you. I'm not sure about the lack of carbonation, but the taste is terrific.","Toddv29424","Jun 23, 2007"

Extremely complex aroma of marshmallow and molasses sweetness, with dried fruits (reminds me of a fruitcake), fresh cut strawberries and smoke. For some reason, I get just a touch of sauvignon blanc-like cat-pee when the beer reaches room temperature. On the palate, fruity malts and a smoky, syrupy sweetness first off. The finish brings out a marshmallow flavor. The whole thing is quite sweet, but with considerable refinement and flavors that keep things just light enough. Mouthfeel is a touch hot and thick and syrupy... but not too much so on any count. For a beer that reaches 11.50 ABV this is incredibly drinkable, with astonishing complexity of flavor. Very enjoyable -- a truly exceptional barleywine.","geexploitation","May 09, 2007"

Almost like a grade A amber maple syrup. Tastes like maple butter. Smooth, sweet and creamy in the mouth. It really did remind me of maple sugar candy.

The nose runs the myriad of peppery alcohol, strong molasses, sweet cherries, and wheat toast. There's also a lot of caramel about, and caramel notes too. Very nice. Taste is very sweet, cloying if taken too quickly, with a very distinct coffee flavor. Very sweet like honey, with a slight ending bitterness that is over almost before I notice. Very fruity from the alcoholic esters, and incredibly malty, like sweet bread. Mouth is thick and syrupy, with no carbonation. This is a very drinkable BW, because the alcohol burn is hidden so well.

The alcohol is very well hidden in the palate. Good mouthfeel. Crisp and defined, not syrupy or loose. My only problem with this beer is that I could never drink more than one. It is just too sweet.

There is quite a bit of sediment left in the bottle. I smell sweet malts with a strong hint of raisins. The alcohol is quite evident in the smell, a bit overpowering, but not unexpected for a beer of this strength. It smells very much like a nice glass of good scotch. The taste is quite sweet, more raisin flavor, as well as faded hop bitterness. Deep roasted malts are evident, as well as caramel and toffee flavors. The alcohol is less obvious is the taste, but still there for sure. This is definitely a beer for sipping and savoring, I'll have to try the more recent bottles.","ericj551","Jun 23, 2006"

Intense sugary malt present in the taste, with notes of fig and other dark fruit. On the first taste i get a hint of meaty flavor in the finish with just a hint of smoke, and later this disappears as the syrupy malt taste dominates. Mouthfeel is not very thick, but there is an oilyness present. Virtually no carbonation, only a slight tingle. I had trouble drinking this brew as it is too incredibly rich for my tastes.

Slight alcohol up front, then a wave of molasses, brown sugar, candied currants, dried prunes, and slight chocolate through the finish. Alcohol is unnoticeable..so long as sips are small.

It was intensely malty, with plum and raisin balancing sweet toffee and caramel, all very English in character. Hints of molasses and vanilla crept in as well. The first flavour that hit me was chocolate covered figs, followed by malty sweet toffee and caramel with some nuttiness. Tobacco, plum and raisin character all appeared, creating a very complex flavour. There was even a bit of bitterness left to balance the overall sweet flavour. The very low carbonation was incredibly fine and completely integrated into the body and texture, which was incredibly smooth. Just a bit of stickiness remained.

Just a bare note of hops on the finish to balance the sweetness, which lingers long after a sip. Alcohol is barely detectable, amazing considering the 11.5%.

Smells of sticky sweet malt, with some nice spicy and earthy hop notes. A bit of an alcohol aroma, not surprisingly, is also present, but does not distract from the beer at all.

Sugary sweetnees comes in early and hangs around. Caramel, toffee, molasses, and even some black licorice are all out to grace my palate. Slightly acidic apples and other fruits fight to get past the sweetness. Hops are barely there, some herbal hints and slight orange peel are the only sign. Mouthfeel is heavy and oily, and warm with alcohol. Although the alcohol is present, it is surprisingly well hidden, especially for this vintage and abv. Finish is oily and laden with sugary malts.

The hops have diminished to a subtle bitterness that works well for the ale but doesn't jump out at you on it's own. That may seem like a redundant list, but it isn't just like molasses, or just like brown sugar.. it's a complex maltiness.

Very sweet, like drinking a sweet sherry with carbonation. Warming mouthfeel, as expected from an 11.5% beer. Its definitely not a beer Id drink every day, but it sure was an interesting experience. The sweetness makes this an alternative to sherry or port, rather than another beer. 275 ml is definitely enough for one sitting.

4.7,10.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"2001 vintage, enjoyed straight from the cellar at 55F. A very deep copper-brown body with amber highlights rests gently beneath an average sized head of creamy off-white froth. The head retention is limited, but at 11.5% that's to be expected - and it still keeps a decent collar which is unusual for such a high alcohol beer! The nose is loaded with sweet, caramelized malt and notes of sticky-sweet dried dark fruit as well as some leafy and almost herbal hops. In the mouth it's full bodied to the point of being syrupy; smooth; and quite creamy. The massive flavor assault that J.W. Lees delivers is quite astounding! It's beyond wort-like in its rich maltiness, dripping with sticky sweetness that's like a combination of honey and port wine. The Kent Goldings come through however, and help to dry it with their leafy and grassy character. The bitterness is noticeably limited, but it's there; and there's a mineral-like edge to it as well that helps keep its toffee/caramel/molasses and dark-fruit maltiness in-check.

Possibly because it's so expensive, but probably more due to the fact that i know i couldn't possibly enjoy it as much as a man whose been drinking fine beer for years and can enjoy it's extreme complexity. If you EVER come across this beer, especially the 97 vintage, i urge you to not pass up the opportunity to try it out.

The body was reddish brown with a little bit of carbonation and no head, as can be anticipated with a seven year old brew. The aroma is a mix of raisins, licorice, and soy sauce. The taste is incredibly bright and fruity for a beer of this age. I can detect grapes, figs, apples, pears, and apricots. There is not even a hint of hop bitterness. The yeast is dusty and zesty, but seems to have thrived for quite a while in the bottle. The beer is definitely a sipper, as the alcohol content is enough to make you keel over unless you are vigilant. The only downfall is the extreme sweetness of the beer, but that comes with the territory I suppose. I will be seeking out more recent vintages of the beer.

This classic brew poured out a nice dark reddish colour with plenty of inherent carbonation. The aromas were all across the board, and very Hardy's like at times. The aromas consisted of dark fruits, spicy alcohol, deep, deep roasted malts, and very freshly cut, bitter, herbal, grassy, sappy, piney, hops. Over the years the hops have been cut down to size and the malt really dominates in this brews taste, but that is OK to me, this is a classic brew, that 6 years of aging has totally rounded into a new dimension of complexity and balance. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but i'll knock a point off for the lack of liveliness. The drinkability is only marred by the super strong ABV. A classic!","francisweizen","Dec 22, 2003"

Poured directly from the cask, there is no visible head or carbonation, it's a serious cask barleywine. Color is a gemlike clear mahogany, and it appears to be fairly thick from the way it clings to the glass. Aroma is a mixture of whiskey and brandy and a little bit of sweet vanilla. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, without being syrupy however. My cask Lees was served appropriately at room temperature, which allowed the flavors to fully blossom immediately upon sipping. Taste is very oakey and reminiscent of a fine brandy at first, then is rounded out with ample sweetness and notes of coffee in the finish. Alcohol presence is certainly noticeable in the before, during, and after sipping, but it does not overcome any of the complex flavor and the Lees is actually quite smooth.

Hops are barely detectable. The taste is reminiscent of a vintage port and provides the same warming experience found in a fine port.
