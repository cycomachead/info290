The flavor is perhaps a touch subdued but delicious none the less. Sweet bourbon creme, toffee, caramel, bourbon whiskey, and dry oak wood meet the palate but it ends lightly fruity. This is very thin and the alcohol heat is not hidden but despite this flaw this is a great beer for a nice price.","KYGunner","Mar 23, 2015"

The wood added undisputable authenticity of bourbon and heavy, heavy, heavy oakiness, both of which lent a balancing bitterness to the cloy of the malts and residual alcohol sugars. The nose and feel complement the taste well, comfortably marking this beer as a knockout. There are so many layers to the aroma, and it just becomes stickier and stickier with each passing moment. We also loved how it left your mouth both cleanly sweetened and dryly chalked, without offense from either the bitters of the cloy. This is a stellar English barleywine, and should be a foremost example, along with the likes of Artic Devil, of how to properly utilizing barreling.","TheBrewo","0"

4.04,-3.8,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"Deep, dark chestnut brown under a low, but very sticky, bubbly head. Smooth, sticky dark malt aromas...raisin, wort-like smells, toffee, plum, cherry, and a fairly mellow barrel character with some vanilla creaminess. Smooth caramel, vanilla, oaky spice, dark fruit, black tea, light sherry, nuts, and cherry. Dry with a quick, tidy finish, not cloying in the slightest and the bourbon isn't boozy. Surprising hoppy bitterness in the finish. Heavy and smooth. Not too much barrel or sticky sweetness for its strength. Pretty nice.","wedge","Feb 24, 2014"

The characteristics of this beer are like a great kindergarten class - it plays well with others and makes even the grumpiest "grown-up" smile and reflect on the the amazing simple joys of life. Very well done.","bilhelm","May 04, 2013"

4.14,-1.4,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Must...resist...making...Clash...joke... Whew, that was harder than it should have been... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear garnet topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, sweet toffee, light oak, light walnut, mild vanilla bean, and a hint of dark fruits in the background. Everything coalesces amiably around a thin core of mild booze. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit of bourbon, a heightened sense of fruitiness, and some added sweetness from a buttercream character. Damn, this is some tasty shit! The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a very nice b-wine, possibly the best AtG has made (at least from the selection we've received here in Chicago thus far). Get some.","TMoney2591","Aug 03, 2012"
3.92,-6.7,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Sweet toffee, caramel, and vanilla in the aroma, sweet with some depth to it. Rich toffee flavor punctuated by an odd sweet candy note like gummy fruit. To be hyper specific: raspberry "Nordic Sweets Forest Berries" gummy candy ... strange. Could be the port sweetness coming through possibly. Smooth feel, rich and not overly cloying, but the candy note is ever present. Dry malty finish. Worth a try, though the flavors didn't really coalesce to me.","emerge077","Jul 08, 2012"
