The mouthfeel had a medium body, it also has a solid amount of carbonation as well. Overall this beer to be seemed more like an American Barley Wine than an English one.

They have great selection and excellent prices on Sunday. Anyway this is a delightful beer that packs a heavy punch. It is a lovely caramel color with a sweet sweet smell and taste. I scored it higher on mouthfeel because it has that strong barleywine feel that welcomes the beer as soon as it hits the pallet. Old Dominion nailed this one.","dball","Oct 16, 2011"

4.08,2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Aroma is light, hints of vanilla, light leather and bourbon are the most pronounced. Really rich smelling and the alcohol is coming through clearly. Evidence of the barrel dominates everything, this is a good thing and even an hour into this bottle, that sweet vanilla aroma is mixing with an almost toffee like touch and a hint of plum. Smooth, rich flavor washes across the tongue, with a splash the bourbon comes right up and grabs me, leather, tobacco and dark almost spicy like notes wrapping around the tongue. Splash of alcohol and a flash of a buttery finish and its gone","mikesgroove","May 29, 2011"
4.03,0.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyable beer. Flavor and aroma are well developed for a younger beer. Characteristics meet my expectations of an English Barleywine.

I smelled a lot, but it gave me a strong sense of softness- vanilla, toffee, and butter. The taste was great- a definite barleywine with enough hops to make it taste somewhere between English and American styles. Would I have it again? HELL YES! I will also accept all donations from the company. One note: I noticed above the ABV is listed as 11.4%, but my bottle has 10.5%.","BuzzLitebier","Apr 09, 2011"

4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a nice clear copper amber color with a thin white head on the surface. The aromatics when the head is present are extraordinarily fruity in nature. I get strong notes of pineapple and mango. When the head subsides the pineapple remains, but it is equaled in potency by the caramel and light toffee notes. The flavors on the tongue are rather similar but rather than a toffee there is more a butterscotch with the caramel and pineapple. It's definitely a unique beer flavor wise, as I've never tasted anything similar to it. Texturally the body is a firm medium that's not boozy in the slightest, and goes down nice and easy. This is a very good beer and I'm surprised that it comes out of a brewery in Delaware that I've never heard of. I'm rather impressed by it.","Vdubb86","Mar 09, 2011"

4.04,1,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a dark copper with one finger of sticky tan head with good retention. Aromas are too obviously alcoholic, with sweet toffee-like malts and faintly floral hops (not nearly hoppy enough!) failing to enter the foreground. The taste, however, is right on the money. This beer is extremely rich, complex, and about as full-bodied and heavy (yet smooth) as they come. Chewy flavors of toffee and caramel dominate the front and mid-palates, and are quite well-balanced by orange citrusy hops. The finish is somewhat medicinal, with intense brown-sugar and cherry flavors that first shock and then haunt the palate for nearly a minute afterward. Overall, I love it.","droomyster","Feb 25, 2011"

More body would really be a good thing, as well as a bump in aromatics. Oh yeah...no head at all??? Nevertheless, this is one tasty English Barleywine. Find a bottle.

The honey comes through in the nose, along with some figs, some apricots, a bit of brown sugar and molasses, and a fairly healthy dose of alcohol. The sweet notes from the nose do come through on the tongue, but they are overpowered by a bland wheatiness and an overtly heavy dose of alcohol. The balance is far too asymmetrical in favor of the latter. A heavy body that thickly coats the tongue, while appropriate and usually nice for barleywines, does not help the drinkability in this case, as it enhances the negatives of the taste.

I have to say it smells incredible with loads of fresh hop notes bursting out in a perfume and floral like presence to my seneses. Also that honey addition the label mentions with the "Premium Ale" that's so AB. Layers of malt sweetness and mild oak barrel charred qualities make me happy. Again caramel and butterscotch notes rise to the occasion carrying out a very big barleywine. Bitterness hits hard the IBUs are definitely kicking with pine, floral, and mild citrus notes. Bitterness is raw and raucous with some balance to it, this is one of the hoppier beers in recent memory.

There's a very strong toasted spiciness in the flavor with the hops really standing forward, almost a rye like note as well. It finishes moderately sweet with the hop bitterness really overtaking.

Full bodied and quite creamy, mid-low carbonation. Some dryness from the alcohol, but the malt keeps this in check. I like this quite a lot.

4.15,3.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Bottled 2/16/06, so not aged at all. Pours a ruddy dark amber-orange color. Produces a 1/2" thick, dense light tan head which slowly fades to a spotty thin coating. Decent lacing as snifter drains. Aromas seem a bit tame for a BW this big and the alcohol tends to dominate a little too much. However, pleasant notes of dark rum soaked fruits, caramel, brown sugar, plum, port wine and a touch of spice from the hops are noted. Mouthfeel is slick, full and oily with a very subtle carbonation. Taste profile begins with a big, sweet malt blast; lots of roasted malt, raisin, honey, brandy and a touch of molasses. This quickly slides into a crisp moderate spicy/floral hop finish with a slight bitterness. A restrained alcohol presence in the end, but well hidden for such a strong BW.

Smells of caramel, honey, raisins, plums and a bouquet of fresh flowers...very interesting combination. The flavor starts with the sweet, syrupy malt with the floral hops following close behind. You get a dark fruit flavor mixed with the hops at the end. Balanced really well between the malts and hops. More of a hop bite than what is expected from an English barleywine but they did a good job with it.. Medium to thick body with low carbonation.

Taste was very malty sweet up front with notes of honey, caramel and alcohol. A light hop bitterness was present in the finish, along with a syrupy, liquourish flavor.

Understated hoppiness. Creamy and sweet throughout, yet lends a subtle bitterness that bodes well against the massive malt complexities of caramel and oak. Where's the booze? I'm not tasting 11.4% whatsoever. It'll probably catch up with me later. Carbonation is low, but this is a year old but even then, I'd expect more. Nonetheless, what small amount that is there goes nicely with the sweetness and high alcohol content, albeit not in the flavor. Does warm the belly after a few minutes though!

The taste is very malty and sweet up front, with more of that cherry coming through, and a slight toastiness. The finish is all hops. Lots and lots of citrusy hops coat the tongue. Tasty. Some alcohol is detected. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick, yet silky smooth. The drinkability lacks some due to the sheer amount of alcohol.

Smells sweet, with caramel malts, a good dose of hops and a fruitiness (apricots?). Has flavors of toasty/biscuity and lots of sweet malts with pine/citric hops that have a bitterness that wavers back and forth between weak and somewhat strong.

Taste is malty with a very substantial hop presence. Lots of honey present too, which leaves the mouth with a nice dry finish. But not with an overhopped burn finish, just honey sugar finish.

The head was very smallish and fleeting, and the beer was quite still in appearance. The aroma was soft and soothing with a mellow restrained flowery hop tone riding atop sherry like alcohol. The taste was quite a bit hot, as the beer had not mellowed at all. Underlying that warm foretaste was the essence of cherry, raisin, and, plum. The hops were earthy, and mildly bitter. The body was relatively thin for the style. The beer felt stingingly warm at the back of the throat, making this a definite sipper, and a slow one at that.

4.21,5.3,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This bottle was given to me by a friend to try out. It's only my second tasting of a barley wine. It poured a beautiful amber color with a slight head and a lot of bubbles. The head didn't last very long, it was gone by the end of my walk from the kitchen to the computer room. The smell and taste is that of hops layed in honey and although it's got a higher alcohol content, it doesnt come off as being too strong. The mouthfeel is seems almost heavy, although the beer is light to drink, when held in the mouth and on the tongue it feels dense and weighty. It has an easy drinkability and goes down very smooth. It also doesn't come off as being as "sticky" as the first barley wine I tried. It's a nice change from my normal Belgian whites and if offered it again I would gladly take another (or two)","JoeNobody","Mar 30, 2005"

Well presented high alcohol. Medium body. Just a masterly balanced barleywine. I think I like it as much as the aged 98 I've had around a year ago, but I don't doubt its capacity to support the test of time.

Aromas are a mix of caramels and resinous earthy piney hops along with some sweet honey tones. There is also a fusel alcohol present. Flavors are a mix of toffees, caramels, and carmelized sugars followed by a pleasant backing of sweet fruits and honey. The body of this brew has a lovely full feel to it and the carbonation was just slight enough to add some depth. The finish is somewhat hot from the alcohol and has a nice bitter grapefruit hop tone just at the end that tries to balance things out. Overall though this brew was good but just a bit too cloyingly sweet for me. I'm sure a couple years of age could really help things out here.","bigbeerdrinka","Jan 13, 2005"

Sweet malt and fruity notes dominated the aroma. Notes of molasses were present as was a bit of alcohol as this warmed. Sweet tasting upfront and a bit of molasses and alcohol lingering in the background. Also there were notes of dark fruits and a slight alcohol bite on the aftertaste. It was sweet but not cloying as the alcohol and hops kept that in check. Almost full bodied this was rich and coating in the mouth.

Aroma is of alcohol with a bit of sweetness to alleviate any worries.This is about the fastest tasting beer i've ever had, but if you let it warm up, it spreads itself out and stays awhile. Very nice, smooth as silk, and mostly all malt. Yeah there's some hops floating around, but this one is about the malt. I do appreciate getting a full description about the beer from the bottle.

But I think I'm conditioned by the current trend in this style to expect truly rocking hop profiles, and that doesn't happen here. Still, standing alone, there are enough hops to nudge you in the side. The ABV lurks somewhat, but it certainly comes clean when it warms your belly and fogs your head. Caution is a prudent concept, but I'd gladly have anouther (though not one for the road!)

This stuff tastes like they added a big shot of vodka to every bottle. Im not sure if I could drink another one.

Aroma of apples, bready malt, pears, alcohol and all around yumminess. The taste mirrors the aroma here. Starts off with a fruity blast, much like some of your belgian ales, then a heavy bready maltiness kicks in along with a citrous hop flavor. LOTS of flavor going on here. One minor complaint is the heavy alcohol taste, which is not masked or blended well. The mouthfeel is nice & chewy, with just enough carbonation. It's a bit sticky in the finish though.

Aroma is fairly sweet, with candy sugars and cherries/strawberry present. Kinda odd, but interesting. Head disappears quickly. Beer settles to an orangish hue. Taste is quite different from the smell.... rich, chewy, a few fruit notes, warming alcohol with a hoppy finish. I'm going to keep the rest around for awhile, drink one every few months and see how it matures. Don't think I could drink more than one in a sitting.","ChrisBowers","Mar 16, 2004"

This brew has a marvelously deep malty nose with a touch of honey. The mouth is prickly and heavy, with a savory sweetness that makes you just want to hold it forever. The malt and honey come out clearly in the initial taste, deep and penetrating, with caramel and toffee tones. Then the hops kick in, bold and beautiful.

4.51,12.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"On tap at the brewpub. Crystal clear deep auburn hue. Sticky almond white head leaves Belgian lace. Gorgeous. Soft floral hops with a tinge of earth and chlorophyll. Melllow honey and medium lovibond sweetness couples with the mild apple esters lending a candied apple impression. Dangerously soft aromawise. Clean honeyish sweetness upfront leads into a well integrated toffeeish presence. Hints of roast lie within the light lovibond caramel. Moderate, super clean hop bitternss barely balances malt sweetness-- they must've toned down the IBUs for this year's batch. Hint of ripe, berryish red licorice esque fruitiness and faint butterscotch. Smooth, lightly dextrinous. Almost creamy in mouthfeel. Finishes with a combination of buttery biscuit, herb and sweet earth. Enveloping alcohol warmth surfaces late. Milennium 2003 is unbelievably mellow and is easily the most drinkable, balanced barleywine I've had in a while. Malt driven, yet superbly balanced.

I had to look at the date again just to make sure it was from the 2002 batch. Hints of raisins, figs and something very earthy comes through. I can definately feel the warming feeling coming through.

The smell is outstanding, with caramel, fresh-baked brown bread, and a dose of honey announcing the rich use of malts (and honey), with some floral hoppiness thrown in for good measure. The taste is initially sweet, though beautifully offset by the generous (but not overdone) use three American hop varieties in the boil. Lest ye think this be an all-American beer, they dry hop with English Kent-Goldings, giving the beer a refined, almost English quality.
