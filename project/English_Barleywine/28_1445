3.98,1.8,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Very nice Barleywine ale. Smell: Banana and orange peel (slight).	Taste: banana, molasses, some orange and other citrus notes with some floral, I assume from the hops. The finish has a brown sugar finish. There is a very slight alcohol taste.	Feel: Smooth and full Overall: a nice ale and unlike the traditional Barleywines it doesn't have that really sweet taste. Very drinkable.","Mickeyp2814","Mar 25, 2015"
4.28,9.5,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall: Tasted this together with the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. While they are both barleywines, the nose and palate are very different between the two. Whereas Bigfoot has a big resinous hop balance to the sweet caramel malt, the Foghorn is dominated by rich banana malt with a moderate herbal hops balance. My first reaction was that I preferred the Bigfoot, but the Foghorn grew on me as I continued to sip. A rich and complex brew.","maedhros09","Mar 20, 2015"
3.9,-0.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.75,"More of an American Barleywine than English, as the hop presence is strong, but not as intense as something like Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. A nice sipping beer, great for a nightcap.","Jacobob10","Mar 20, 2015"

4.09,4.6,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Overall- Very enjoyable, very sweet, malts and fruits combine for a fruitcake-like quality to this beer. This teeters more towards an american style barleywine, as there is a slight hop bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. But lots of toasted malts, lots of bright fruits, fairly warming for the lower abv on the 2014 vintage of 8.8%.","OrangeMen","Feb 21, 2015"

While it does fit the more malt-forward profile of an English barleywine, I also think it walks a nice line between the English and American barleywine styles, with a little bit of American hoppiness to balance the sweet English maltiness.","Kuaff","May 27, 2014"

The aroma and flavour are similar, with a backbone of sweet, fruity malt and subtle hop notes. Fantastic body - borders on unctuous. Very sweet but a pleasant sipper. Would be perfect for winter; worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","May 18, 2014"

4.27,9.2,4.25,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Some people in the US may laugh at the notion, but this beer has been one of my so-called "whales" for a long time. I had yet to find it in Canada, anywhere, and still have yet to see it in bottles. Alas, Beer Revolution here in Cowtown snagged a keg and I essentially teleported down there to sample a 12 oz. goblet. A unique brick red shading into brown hue that recalls autumn leaves (uh oh, finding this brew has brought out my whimsical artsy side ...), with some light tan bubbles draped over the matte bronze. Very hop forward aroma, with rich toffee, orchard fruit, cut flowers and pine resins intermingling but not clashing. Palate features licorice toffee, molasses, leather, candy apple, burnt pancakes, port wine, pine, and hazelnuts, with a lemon-lime hop garnish that becomes more perceptible as your palate habituates to the malts. Yeast esters galore and overall features a complex and robust yet refined flavor profile, less intense than many so-called American barley wines but still hoppy and vibrant. I get the English designation but the hops are American in my book. Less thick than many other barley wines, quite smooth on the mouth but finishes rather bitter, medicinal, and woody. Although allegedly this brew has changed over the years, it still tastes like a true classic to me. With any luck we'll get bottles in this province. I have to say, coming to craft beer at this relatively late stage in my life has made the whole ride quite fun ... Read about the iconic beers, wait for them to show up in this market, rejoice when they finally do ...","CalgaryFMC","Mar 15, 2014"

3.5,-10.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"definitely not my favorite barleywine, even of the English blood. this one is a little too sweet and fruity, more like a jammy desert than a beer, but it is still expertly crafted, I just personally don't care a whole lot for the flavor, especially compared to other anchor brews. a little haze to the deep amber bodied liquid. an inch of tan head dies in a minute or so, and a still, intimidating glass remains. aromatics of dried apples, fresh apples, and a certain nutty vibe, underneath English ale yeast. molasses notes on the flavor, with a whole truckload of grain, thick an sticky sweet. the apples are there too on the first half, and as I wait and wait for the dry hopping the label tells me to expect, it never comes. sweetness is never cut by hops, and the aftertaste is real odd as a result. the alcohol is hidden well enough, but this is a dense brew that demands persistence and patience. I like the carbonation, and I like the body, I just don't really care for the taste. well made though, and sturdy for anchor. fall would be its most appropriate season.","StonedTrippin","Sep 30, 2013"

3.72,-4.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I tried the 2009 version. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. This beer has a copper hue. It is slightly cloudy. Medium amount of head that dissipates quickly. Not very much lace on the sides of the glass. Aroma is malty and fruity, with some peach, apricot and plum. Not much floral or herbal notes from the hops. Taste is pretty sweet with honey and lots of malt coming through, but not much hops. Overall it tastes like what I would expect for a barleywine. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy as I would expect, very little carbonation. This beer takes me back to my first craft beer experiences in the 1980s - I enjoyed it a lot.","PacNWDad","Nov 07, 2012"

The price is a bit high, but as a trade off it's nice to see a beer of this style and strength still available in a six pack. This beer has been around for a long time and according to anchor, was the great grandaddy of the American Barley-Wines. I like the fact that the brewer uses the unique dating system so we know the bottling date. This is a nice beer to sip and enjoy with friends on a cool evening, reflecting on old times.","mitch3114","Nov 01, 2012"

Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, orange, bread, toast, toffee, herbal, pine, molasses, earth, and light banana. Very nice and balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big raisin, prune, toffee, caramel, orange, molasses, herbal, floral, toast, biscuit, earth, and light banana. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, molasses, caramel, toast, banana, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with good complexity; and no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English barleywine. Nice flavor complexity and balance; and quite smooth to sip on.

The flavor up front is sweet from the abundant malt. There are also some notes of raisin, spice, and I can definitely taste the alcohol. There is some hop bitterness, but it's not a very strong flavor. It's full bodied, but still crisp due to the carbonation. It's a sipper, but a very pleasing sipper.

4.09,4.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark honey color bordering on burnt orange with ruby highlights and an ample tan head to match. The aroma is a pleasing combination of sweet malt and crisp hop working in harmony. The flavors here are huge and unabashed. A sweet, toasted, almost bock-like malt lays the foundation (brown sugar comes to mind). This is accompanied by just enough hop flavor to keep the sweetness from getting out of control. Raisin is easily ascertainable. Nutty flavors are also present, as is a hint of chocolate that manages to sneak through the boozy fog that asserts itself on the back end, along with a more noticeable hop bitterness. Another reviewer noted cinammon, and while I wouldn't have identified it myself, I can recognize it in retrospect. There's more than enough going on here to keep your tastebuds interested for the entire glass. The alcoholic taste may be a little abrasive for some, but it doesn't seem out of place amidst the other bold flavors. I have neglible experience with barleywines, but I like what I'm seeing here from Anchor. I'd go so far as to say this is one of their best brews, easily better than their more widely acclaimed offerings. Definitely worth trying if you've never had.","MaximalC","Mar 25, 2012"

Just something about looking at a fine beer in a mason jar. Big dark fruits in the nose is suprising - plum, fig, caramel, booze, oak, touch of vanilla and of course a noticeable spice hop presence. Taste holds true to the nose but very impressed with the balance in this one. The spicey hop character melds so well with the dark fruits & caramel sweetness, crazy smooth.

I love myself a malt-bomb from time to time but this is takes that idea a little far. This isn't bad, but it is on the edge, which I do admire. I love the flavors, especially the crazy candy-caramel, I just wish the attenuation was a little higher so that it went down easier than maple syrup.

The start is of caramel malt and toffee, in the middle is a tart raspberry flavor and a sweet almost candy like flavor rounded out by dark fruits and a hint of green apple bitterness. Again no real hop presence, the flavor was very sweet and a little of out balance but also enjoyable as an after dinner desert beer. The mouthfeel is a little syrupy and slightly slick with a low level of carbonation. Overall it was a solid beer, would be good as a dessert beer, a big sweet taste dominates.

Maybe an American Old Ale? This beer is going the direction of some of my favorite beers, but there is something just missing to take it beyond just being an average beer.

Mouthfeel just like the transparency, light and thin, almost watery for a barleywine. Nose leads with hops and spices, some bananas but more faintly. Tastes begins with hops, sweet malts in the middle, finishes fruity with caramel. Standard barleywine overpowered by spice that kicks in and throws everything out of whack. Purely opinion, but spice is out of place in a BW. Yeah too spicy for my taste but I also objectively feel that it's out of place for the style. Also way too much warmth considering it's only 8.8%. Which is also a VERY low abv for the style. But they still somehow manage to not hide even this low abv. So we're left with a low abv that still comes out tasting slighty boozy.

4.35,11.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a nice mahogany, with some ruby red notes around the edges. Initial pour yielded no head, but a ring of single bubbles. Subsequent swirls procured a beige head. Nose has strong caramel and toffee notes, some alcohol, and notes of some darker fruits. Not raisin-like or anything, but significantly lighter in the 'dark' spectrum of fruits. Can't accurately describe this. Intriguing nonetheless and surely mouthwatering. Taste is a sweet, rich and complex interplay of toffee and caramel again, some warming alcohol and alcohol soaked dark fruits. Alcohol is well integrated in this, yet quite prominent still. Some bread and mild chocolate (?) notes as it warms. Great smooth mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Only complaint is the prominence of the alcohol (sans burning character) at this ABV (this bottle is listed as 8.2%) and at this age. Mouthfeel becomes creamier as it warms. Great drinkability, yet a bit heavy for the alcohol content. Enjoyed this immensely nonetheless. Great stuff, and solid nightcap.","liamt07","Mar 18, 2011"

Alcohol hits the nose first, which is surprising considering the relatively tame ABV for a barleywine. Lots of caramel malt in the nose as well, with a bit of dark fruit. Dark fruit and sweet sugary malt appear in the taste first, with some candied fruit and alcohol. The booze isn't as pronounced in the taste at it is in the aroma, but it is still pretty strong.

The front palate is brown sugary and sweet before flavors of Amontillado and aged port become more apparent in the middle. A back tea and light citrus bitterness provide some support. The body is as full, smooth, and mouth-filling as beer can get. Dark fruits like dates and raisins, along the sherry notes, linger long on the finish. If a beer can be said to have gravitas, this is one that would have it. I love it.","droomyster","Feb 25, 2011"

Some very weak bubbles and nothing in terms of a cap, this beer looks pretty dead all right. Smell is real tame considering the style, and the brewery. I really gotta sniff to get toasty malted barley, some pound cake, light fruits and, well, that's it. Alcohol does not come out, but it is a bit light in the loafers per style. Foghorn is a come and go B-wine. Blunt and to the point. Caramel coated fruit with some toasted bread, some toffee, light chocolate. To put it in the front, nothing really stands out. I was looking for a bit of a alcohol sting to remind me what im drinking. Feel is a big medium with a low hardly felt carb, it could use a boost. Reminds me of Ridge Runner by Rock Art but that seemed to have more ummpphh to it. A good drinker but a bit overpriced for what it is.","BARFLYB","Feb 16, 2011"

It has a rich, thick feel that coats every corner of my mouth. It has sweet yet dry fruits that roll around as well.

A little on the thin bodied side, which is surprising. Lots of flavors going on.. mostly getting that chocolate though, which I just never expected to be getting from a barley wine, tastes a little out of balance to me too... just too much going on. Interesting to try, and it will definitely leave you pretty buzzed. I was expecting better to be honest though, I've had a lot better barley wines but this one gets points for being different I guess (this is in no way a hop bomb like SN.. reminds me more of Brooklyns Monster Ale).","oriolesfan4","Jul 16, 2009"

It is dangerously drinkable. I'm not saying I'd be eager to drink all six in one night but after work, or after a hard day this one really hits the spot. The only problem I have with this beer is its price, not so drinkable. $15 and change for a sixer is pretty damn high for a beer that almost always grabs me the wrong way atleast for the first few sips...guess I'm not really ever prepared for the high alcohol and heavy malt sweetness.","becktone","Nov 09, 2008"

Regardless of the origins of its taste, however, this beer tastes pretty good, and I'm sure a lot of what a more recent Old Foghorn would lose in complexity it would make up for with a more vibrant appearance, nose, and feel.

The first smell of this beer opened up my senses with a mixture of hots and malts. But upon another sniff, I detected a hint of fruit. The taste of this beer is a good even mix of hops and malts, but once agian i detect a faint taste of fruit in the aftertaste. Also, there is a bit of an alcohol flavor that hits you right at the start, but it smooths out as you get towards the middle of your glass.The mouthfeel of this beer is very light and crisp, leaves no coating and goes down smooth. Overall this is a very enjoyable beer, but it is definatly more is a sipping beer, towards the end of the glass, you can feel the 8% abv coming thorugh.

Raisins, brown sugar, molasses, caramel malts, some sweetness, and a solid but not dominant citrus/floral hop flavor. As I continued to drink this I picked up some and more alcohol. This is only 8.8% ABV and that was hidden amazingly well at first but quickly became apparent and a bit too noticeable. Mouthfeel is good, medium-full bodied with residual sweetness, a bit syrupy, and moderate carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good. The only thing that held this beer back was an alcohol presence that exceeded its ABV. By the end of the glass I felt that I was drinking a much stronger barley wine.

This one poured a very nice and thick looking ruby tinted brown with a small say about a finger and a half of white lace and foam on the top. Quick recession led to a decent but not impressive side glass presentation and virtually no carbonation was immediately visible. Smell was very sweet with candy like sugar and a rich malty smell, some light hops in the foreground, but they have been mostly mellowed out. A thick syrup like feel, with not a lot of carbonation was what was waiting for me. There was a nice sweet flavor to this, and a touch of alcohol was most definitely present. A good piney hop finish was there drawing out the flavors of fresh grass and a light bread like malt. Overall this was a standard, if not a little sweet American Barley Wine. Not the biggest I have ever had, but still decent. This was a more drinkable Barley Wine, in akin to the Bigfoot. You could enjoy the sweeter nectar like tones of this.

A strong malty sweetness hits the palate first followed by warm, dark, fruity alcohol. The hops are still fresh but get along nicely with the barley. Flavorful and sticky - like sugar-coated, rum-soaked bread. Quite tasty and yet, I imagine its even better with some more age. Nice, solid mouthfeel - very smooth and lightly carbonated. Not as outright hoppy as most American versions.","wedge","Aug 28, 2007"

The barleywine poured a off color brown, with some fizzy head, and aromas of medicinal alcohols and candied malts. Flavors were less than impressive- odd earthy malts, with an oily, burning ,syrupy, pharmaceutical essence. A few sips of this carbonated used bubble gum water and i was done.

Great aroma dominated by malts. Taste shows some cola sweetness and some coconut. Rich caramel sweet maltiness with some berries and fruit, finishing with just a hint of hoppy dryness mixing with the sweet and tangy berry taste.

On the palate, bitter and citric first-off, before transitioning into some heavy, sweet tea-like flavors. It's an intense, cloying sweetness that's unattenuated by aging. Mouthfeel is quite thick, with zesty bitterness that clings to the tongue. Overall, this beer has too much sweetness at this young age, and not enough hop bitterness. With time, what hop bitterness is here will thin out a bit, but the malts will become smoother as well, creating a more palatable drink. Good now, but without a strong food pairing, it's best to hold off on this and let it age a bit.","geexploitation","May 14, 2007"

Taste is of a soft, not particularly aggressive barleywine with nice subdued peaty notes along with malt and noble hops. A bit of a metallic note to it but not in an extreme way. alchol obviously present, but blended well with the malt flavor. as it warms, a fruitness comes out as well that's nice. thinner than i expected but fine for the style i guess. a nice drinking, if run-of-the-mill barleywine.","aforbes10","May 08, 2007"

Taste follows with a very well balanced sweet maltiness, some raisins but not as much as most barleys, along with some coffee notes that are more noticeable in the nose than in the taste.

Not only should beers this strong or stronger be approached with moderation, but I personally dont always want to drink 22ozs of such robust, alcoholic brews.

Slight alcohol bite. Great full body. Very drinkable-always has been-hopefully always will be. Now in 12 ounce bottles-for several years now the retailer told me.

Taste is on the malty side for sure, with flavors of cherry, vanilla, maple, wood and a bit of hoppy pine resin on the finish. Mouthfeel if creamy with a pleasant viscosity and some prickly carbonation. Drinkability is solid for a barleywine. A solid ale that has more in commen with the English style as opposed to the hoppier, American style. It loses a bit in taste for me because there is a slight funky/medicinal quality I'm associating with the alcohol.","unclederby","Oct 18, 2006"

It's a perfect dessert beer or after-dinner sipper. I let mine warm up to around cellar temperature and poured it into a snifter and it was excellent.

Moderate bitterness with the flavour following the aroma profile. The alcohol is warming in the finish and the balance is in favour of the caramel maltiness.

There are hints of molasses and smoky malt. Well-balanced. In the mouth, this beer is bitter, full and has minimal carbonation. Overall, this is a decent barleywine.

Is this ale filtered? The scent is estery and unmitigated alcohol with notes of dried raisins and toffee. The initial taste is quite a puncha malt punchquickly chased down by caramel and semi-sweet chocolate. Given the esters in the smell, this ale is much sweeter than I expected. As it goes down, it has a distinctly slippery mouth feel, reminiscent of olive oil-soaked noodles. This mouth feel could lead one to try to gulp this beer, but at a listed 10% ABV, that might be problematic.

There are also some red liquorish, strawberries and blueberries and a hint of an ambiguous dry hop that is obscuring a bit of alcohol. Very nice, but very subtle. Starts with a smooth pale malt base and some raspberries but then picks up some rather large hop notes that are primarily drying but release some rose and pineapple notes. The finish is oaky and it leaves a strange little sting right in the middle my tongue. The mouth feel isnt as thick as the slow bubbles suggested. The body is medium and the carbonation is tiny.

The aroma has big citrus and piney hop character, as well as sweet caramel malt, fruity esters, ethanol, and some toasted bread...not the most complex but seems traditional and appropriate. The flavor starts off with some citrus and piney hop notes, followed by a big malt character consisting of caramel, molasses, dark fruits (prune, fig, date, raisin, plum), licorice, vanilla, fruity esters, extremely mild alcohol and some oak. The mouthfeel is rich and chewy, with light carbonation and high drinkability, especially for an american barleywine. If you're looking for an over-the-top hop bomb then this certainly isn't for you, but if an exquisitely well balanced beer is your thing then look no further.

The taste is an interesting mix of fruity sweetness with caramelized sugar sweetness that begins to overpower other flavors in the beer as it warms. Near the end of my pint, the sweetness was a bit much for me to really enjoy the beer. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness, as if I had just consumed loads of candy. The aftertaste is difficult to get rid of, that's my problem with it.

By the end the head recedes completely, making it look kinda like a liqueur. There's an initial punch of sweetness and burning alcohol in the nose followed by a good amount of hops, raisins, and caramel with perhaps molasses. The alcohol aroma then hides until the end. Lots of sweet malts on the palate, with caramel, molasses, bubblegum, fruitiness, raisins, anise, and piney/citric hops with a bitterness that is substantial but tamed by the malts. There's also a kind of rooty character to it - that's the best way I can describe it. The body is thick and smooth, with a high viscosity that coats the mouth well. Despite all the flavors I have named, it is hard to point out/describe the flavors because they are blended so well. A tasty barley wine, but I usually like mine with more bitterness and hop flavor.","mmmbeer","Nov 15, 2005"

The mouthfeel is chewy, but only for a couple of seconds. Not really much to it, unfortunately. I rated the drinability higher because it is very easy going down, but at $3.00+/bottle, the taste, aroma and appearance of this one just don't measure up...All respect due to Anchor for inaugurating this style in the U.S., but it seems that Old Foghorn's time has come and gone.","orfeu","Nov 13, 2005"

Much better than it's bastard cousin Anchor Small Beer, but that's not saying much.

I recall really liking Old Foghorn, often referring to it as one of the best barleywines. It no doubt is good, but over the past year I've had many, many barleywines and now I feel this one isn't quite on the top perch anymore. After a year of aging it has mellowed out some more, although this was never an aggressive beer to begin with; much more on the malty side campared to the plethora of hoppy barleywines out there. Has a very nice sweet cognac character to it, definitely a sipper. Hell, if you don't sip it you'll be finished in several swallows anyway (damn small bottles). I wonder if this really benefited much from aging because although it may have changed slightly, I wouldn't say it's any better. In comparison, I noticed a bigger difference after cellaring Bigfoot for a year or so. Still a great, strong, drinkable brew, and a classic one-of-a-kind to boot.","Gruntlumber","Nov 07, 2005"

This isn't nearly as hoppy as expected, seems that I've gotten used to the "extreme" barleywines of the west coast like Old Crustacian. Rich malts rule the palate here with dark fruit flavors and hints of chocolate coming through. Mild alcohol flavor becomes apparent in the finish.

The nose on this one is rich and practically bursting at the seams. Piney hops, tangy alcohol bite, ripe plums, grape-skins, ash, rum-soaked raisons. A perfect representation of the taste practically, malty and rich up front with flavors of mild caramel and raison , then I pick up on the plum and grape-skin. Admirable bitterness through-out, the finish is rich and creamy with dense malts, pine-sap hops, and a spicy twang of alcohol.

3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Murky, peachy-coppery-brown in hue with a reddish highlight, the color doesnt change much when held to a light. The head never formed that well, at the most it reached a fourth of a finger and it didnt lasted very long. Actually by the time I set my snifter down the head had faded to a soapy collar. The color of the head was off-beige. Some lacing attempted to form once I started to imbibe; the spotty lacing didnt cling very well. It looks like a Barleywine. And, oh my, does it smell like one! The rich malty aromas ignited my mouth, a fit of watering ensued! Caramel infused with alcohol, distant but still noticeable hops, firm and American. Kisses of ginger cookies, dry sugar dusting coats a plum or a cherry. The bouquet reminds me a great deal of Free States Old Backus Barleywine. I dont think Anchors has as much depth but I am not complaining! The potency is moderate but the invitation is clearly positive! Drink me! The palate is very good, no complaints, I could quaff this all night, I mean 7-ounces at a time isnt much. Okay aside from that, my only negative remark about this beer is if I crank up the beer geek in me. What is the issue? The malt backbone just doesnt have much taste-depth. Nitpicking I know. I really like the juicy characteristics, which work in harmony with a slight plumy taste, oranges too. The hops are firm but not overly flavorful. Well crafted for sure, not that loud however. Im sure age and brewing style has a lot to do with this. Sugary sweet finish, ample and tasty, turning warm from the alcohol. The aftertaste is very relaxing. This is a classic beer for a warm winter night. It is a shame that this beer is impossible for me to find anywhere locally (including KC and Iowa City). The mouthfeel is a bit slight, even watery, low carbonation but, overall, it feels good in the mouth. This beer is tasty, I like it, and even with the high abv it is easy to drink.

It is very thick and syrupy, staying on my tongue after swallowing the beer. There is a nice sweetness that stays after the beer is swallowed.

After the head was down to a few random bubbles coating the top no significant lace was present during its consumption. The aroma is of a slightly sweet fruity malt nature with a bit of alcohol emerging after warming. Sweet fruity malt is the main component of the taste with dark fruits showing and a slight earthy tone as well. There is enough hop inhere to give it a good balance and keep this from being an overly sweet barley wine. A full and creamy mouthfeel is what youll get with this as the warm coating fruity covers with every sip. Fairly drinkable with a not so strong alcohol presence and a pleasant taste.

There's no roastiness and the hops are decidedly resigned, making this a pleasantly surprising and surprisingly old-world style barleywine.

Pours a deep mahogany color with an impressive tan head. The head is surprisingly frothy for a barley wine. Alcohol aroma is evident on the pour, followed quickly with piney hops and ripe fruits. Sweet malt is evident in the smell as well, but takes a backseat to hopscertainly an American Barleywine. Warming begins on the tip of the tongue, and continues to build from there. Expected sweetness up front, mixed with fruitiness and esters. Still, as in the aroma, the balance is tilted toward hops. Overall, the beer has moderate carbonation, but it seems fairly pronounced for the style. Full mouthfeel, and slightly oily. This is a fantastic beer. Its flavorful, intense, and well-made.

The appearance of this beer is light in color in comparison to most barleywines with a small fizzy lightly tan head. The smell is a little on the weak side but I noticed a toffee flavor mixed with a pinewood precense. Taste is strong on the malts with caramel being the main flavor. Surprisingly, considering this is an American barleywine, the hops were very weak and seemed to be dominated by the malts. This beer had a thin body and was a little buttery as well. Alcohol was not really too noticeable until the finish but it faded quickly and there was basically no finish. Maybe it was the Thomas Hardy's I had the night before, or maybe it was because the Pistons were losing, but I was really disappointed with this beer.

Acceptable lacing, and this offering has a hearty grainy aroma which also gives away the higher alcohol content (as if the wimpy bottle size didn't trumpet the fact). Taste is upfront with some good malt character, then segues into a slight amount bitterness, which finally gives way to the radiational warming of the alcohol.

Barley Wine style ales are not my favorite style, but I can appreciate them and their place in beerdom. You can't go wrong with Anchor, and as far as BW's go, I guess it's O.K.. Probably would rate higher with some aging. I bought my samples straight from the brewery and they were pretty fresh. I'll try that possibly and re review in the future.

There was no vintage date on the bottle, indeed no date at all that I could tell, but I believe this bottle was a few years old when I had it. There was very little head from the beer, which may have been handicapped by the fact that I poured it into a fairly wide "brandy snifter" type glass. The beer was not highly carbonated either. The color was a light brownish-amber, and was noticably cloudy as well. The aroma was very powerful, and featured a bit of malt along with spicy notes - raisins, a minty quality, and another aroma that reminded me of tea leaves. The flavor was big and bold and seemed balanced toward the bitter side. The finish had hints of dark chocolate and sharp, rich resiny bitter notes. The beer was good but seemed a little one-dimensional - I expected more fruitiness and malty sweetness. Still, this has its place in my barley wine favorites and I enjoyed it immensely.","KroMagnon","Jan 27, 2004"

Flavor begins sweet with dried fig and brown sugar, then becomes spicy and herbal... the hops shine through but don't dominate.

Candy sugar, prunes and toffee mingle with a mild lemony citrus bitterness. A peppery spiciness offers a bit of an edge to an otherwise rounded and mellow brew.

The hops were a lot less present than I expected, since they say this is dry-hopped with a lot of Cascades. The alcohol really sticks out in the flavor, and the raisins come back in. Hops carry on throughout, as does the malt body. A little maple syrup character. Medium body is thinner than most barleywines. Extremely well balanced throughout.

Instead they were just there to balance the sweetness as far as I could tell. Very sweet and fruity upfront with a floral hopiness in the back. Some hops bitterness showing up in the end with a roasted, bready malt just filling the mouth in the aftertaste. Very full bodied and clinging. Creamy smooth.

A very smooth barleywine that is not very full bodied and one that ends in a fairly balanced way.

The nose is malty, with a bit of tart fruitiness, and a distractingly strong alcohol nose. Mouthfeel was the main problem -- this beer just struck me as too limp, almost watery. This affected the perception of the flavor for me. The flavor came off as a sort of malty nuttiness, combined with all too much hop bitterness (not a phrase I utter often). Fruitiness lends a sweetness for just an instant mid-palate, but not enough for balance. I wish I knew what happened to this beer.

With the high alcohol, one should not drink too many of these at one sitting, but the flavor is striking making it a pleasure.","LarryKemp","Jan 25, 2003"
3.01,-23,4,3,3,2.5,3,"As with all my other tastings of this beer, I find it to be very strange indeedan English Style barleywine that tastes like it was fermented at a Bavarian Weisse brewery. Infinite props to Fritz for reviving the barleywine style in 1975. At the same time, thank you to all the American micros who made barleywine in America what it is today.","TXHops","Jan 18, 2003"
4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a medium mahogany color with a thin yet creamy tan colored head that fades into a thin lace with a bubbly ring along the sides of the glass. Nose is dark sweet fruits and caramel with a hint of spice. Taste is a nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops with notes of chewy caramel and a noticeable alcohol bite. The taste seems to come more alive as the beer warms a bit. A nice barley wine. My biggest complaintthe silly little 7oz. bottles!","Morris729","Jan 12, 2003"

4.5,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Never have seen a barleywine on tap, so I jumped at the chance to sample this. Was served in an 8 oz wine glass, with the bartender's warning about the high ABV. Cloudy, dark amber color, I smelled it like a real wine snob. The taste was marvelopus. Sweet, but not sickenling sweet. A definite keeper.","bewareOFpenguin","Jan 02, 2003"
3.17,-18.9,3.5,4,3,3,2.5,"This was my first barleywine and I didn't care for it much. The fruity aroma was nice, but I didn't enjoy the taste. The sweetness and hops were overshadowed by an alcohol taste. High alcohol beers that don't have huge hops to balance don't work for me. I'll have to revisit this one in the future because I couldn't detect any of the complexities this round.","ethosx19","Dec 25, 2002"
4.34,11,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The Big Old Bad Boy pours deep amber to copper color with a premium head and the lace nice fine sheets to seal the glass. Ah that sweet Bubble Gum aroma with malts and light hits of citrus, what a treasure for the senses. Front is malt and somewhat sweet, the top middling and the finish tart, pertinently hopped and the carbonation acceptable, aftertaste malt dry and the high ABV, warms the tummy. One of the better Barley wines and the first of that style I ever sampled, think I will buy a case or two for the long Arizona Winter.","Gusler","Dec 23, 2002"

4.5,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Anyway, Old Foghorn is an extremely unique barleywine - unlike any other! The first whiff includes a good dose of what appears to be Northern Brewer hops (although Jackson lists them as Cascade), followed by a light caramel malt character. This beer has been filtered and pours crystal clear with a dark copper cast and ruby highlights. There's also a ring of cream colored head which lasts throughout. Limited lace, however. The flavor is centered around the hops - not surprising since it's dry hopped for 9-18 months. The malt flavor is basic and supports the hop flavor and bitterness well. The body is lighter than some "syrupy" barleywines which gives it a little more drinkability; although hops tend to help give the impression of a thinner body as well. There's a light citrusy, almost pine-like, dryness and some gentle fruitiness. The finish is, again, based on the hops - also not surprising since it's packing around 65 BU's. A very rewarding beer.","NeroFiddled","Jul 18, 2002"
3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pretty good, very hoppy and spicy for such a strong beer, nice slightly roasty malts, but i noticed the hops more, very nice, but mouthfeel was syrruppy and even a bit thinner than what i expected (not to say that its not a full-bodied brew), why is this split up into different beers, the recipe doesn't change every year does it?","rastaman","Jul 11, 2002"
3.68,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Notes: A sample with age that is for sure, a little loss taken with the hop character both in aroma and flavour. Yet the aging has seemed to put a bit more depth back in. Sip this with after dinner or even with a cigar. A sure thing either way as far as barleywines go. If you are into aged barleywine and don't mind spending the $2.99 then this is for you. Just shy of 9.0% abv.","Jason","Jun 22, 2002"
4.27,9.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Slightly hazy ruby hue w/ a thin but tight head.  The appetizing aroma consists of sweet caramel malt, toffee, toasted malt, mild biscuity graham cracker sweetness and potent, heaty fusels in the finish.  The hop nose seems faded even this young-- only a hint of citrus from the Cascade is perceptible. Sweet, but complex in flavor.  Date - like sweetness, and dark crystal malt flavors are prominent, but fruity yeast esters are there as well.  Hop bitterness is restrained yet well calculated to prevent cloying residual malt sweetness.  Biscuity flavors, tip of the tongue sweetness along with a satisfying alchol warmth comprise the long - lasting finish.  Old Foghorn is a fine barleywine, but seems to lack the body that previous years have had.  In any case, my main qualms with this brew is the 7 ounce bottle size.  What a tease. It's always a treat.","marc77","Jun 09, 2002"
4.38,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear shade of burgandy. No head. Only a slight tan collar. Nice aroma with the heavy sweet malt tones mixing with candy-like sweetness. Fruity, sweet malt tones dominate. The caramel malt sweetness is delicious. Alcohol fumes are noted to a mild degree. There is a noticeable bitterness that lingers, but nothing over-the-top. Not as syrupy as many Barleywines. But this beer does glide over the tongue fairly effortlessly. This is a very nice barleywine. Trouble is, I'm not going to buy it much. A single a year if that. I can buy comparable (even slightly better) barleywines at a cheaper price. I'd much rather get a six pack of 12 oz Old Horizontal for $12 or a six pack of 12 oz Bigfoot for $10 instead of a six pack of 7 oz Old Foghorn for $17. Come on! You're good, but there are other cheaper, better options. And let's kick this 7 oz habbit. Rogue caught on. Now it's your turn.","Bighuge","May 31, 2002"
4.49,14.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Deep, semi-opaque chestnut color, no head to speak of after 20 seconds. Aroma is very piquant, makes the little nose hairs stand up, sharply astringent. Deep, tunneling, spiraling flavor -- first of cherry and raisin, then meandering toward a bitter orange with hops and alcohol making a clear statement. Surprisingly clean aftertaste, inviting another sip to make it all happen again. Not at all heavy and more drinkable than a lot of "heavy weights"...a fine little bottle indeed.","ADR","May 26, 2002"
4.3,10,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Normally, barleywines are not one of my more favored styles, as they usually end with a sweetness I find cloying.  I was happily surprised with this beer, particularly since it is quite young.  Dark caramel and aged fruit with and clean finish.  Lots of depth to the flavor.  Sipping it as I sat on the patio - happiness in a glass.  Going to put some back to age and see what happens.","Brent","Apr 14, 2002"
