A benchmark for the style for sure, considering all that the American craft brew scene has done with barleywines.  A great barrel-aged barleywine.","SaisonRichBiere","Feb 14, 2015"

4.24,2.7,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Port Cask aged JW Lees pours an opaque mahogany. There's about half a finger of khaki colored foam topping the beer, and flashing just a little bit of head retention and lacing. There's a ton of sediment settling towards the bottom of the glass, more than I'd expect to come from such a small bottle. The port cask aging is very evident in the nose, lots of potent dark fruits like one would expect from port. There's just a hint of oxidation present, and some caramel aroma as well. The base barleywine shines through a little more in the flavor profile, balancing well against the port influence. Oxidation remains very much secondary/in the background. The body, while firmly malty, is miles away from syrupy, thanks in part to a spot on, mild carbonation. This iteration of JW Lees marries one of my favorite styles to one of my favorite barrel treatments, with predictably great results. I can't wait to try my hand at brewing something in this vein over the summer.","axeman9182","Apr 19, 2012"

Up front it was all fruit on the palate, very similar in character to the aroma. Bready and caramel malts contributed sweetness part way through, with port and alcohol warmth lingering in the finish. Bitterness was very low. Full bodied with lowish carbonation, smooth and just short of sticky. This is a great sipping beer, particularly if you're fond of port.

The taste is similar to the aroma, I can taste brown sugar, dark fruit (figs, raisins), oak, butterscotch and a bit of port. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit slick and velvety.

A tiny amount of lacing. Caramel and honey in the nose, less fruity, but figs and raisins are present. More oak and vanilla in this one. Much more subtle tastes than the calvados. The grain and malt of the beer show through much better. The alcohol is up front, with the port taking hold in the middle and finish. Somewhat vimuous and fruity, but less sweet. Lovely malt and dried fruit flavors blended nicely with toffee and butterscotch. Less vanilla in the taste, but the oak shines throughout. Same lactic mouthfeel, but less stickiness.","magictrokini","Beers"

Wow, the port really comes through in the after taste and mingles very well with the barleywine flavors. On the tongue it almost has an uncarbonated soda sort of feel, I'm thinking Dr.Pepper or Coke. Mostly malts, sweetness, and candied fruits before the port comes into play. Top notch beer for sure.","timbro81","0"

A brief caramel malt note is noticed amid a background of port and wood notes that run the length of the aromatic experience. Very nice smooth tasting barleywine. It seems to begin with ripe cherries, sweet dark grapes, figs, sugar coated plums and stewed raisins. I then get port mixed with maple syrup and wood.

The taste was earthy and of course, yeasty, yet sweet like a Dutch chick's.... Mouthfeel was full with cherry sweetness. Viscous and satisfying.

It is hard to tell where the beer ends and the ports starts, as all of the aromas I detect can be found in both. The port is a lot more identifiable in the taste. Caramel, dates, currants, vanilla, oak, tannins, alcohol. The mouthfeel is full bodied, lightly carbonated of silky smooth. Overall, this beer in many ways reminds me of Avery's The Beast.

Some savory spice and marshmallow, along with a bright fruity candy note whose exact nature I can't pinpoint. On the palate, a touch too heavy, with huge thickness and stickness that crosses over into the territory of "cloying". Quite sweet, with no discernible flavor or aroma hops: the most dominant notes are those fruity, winey notes. Plenty of sweet flavors are there, too, but they are more expressive in the nose. Overall, this is a very good barleywine, but not up to some of the other JW Lees cask offerings IMO. The fruit character is nice on the nose but too forward on the palate, while the other, darker flavors I expect from a wood cask are undeveloped in the taste department.

Looks a typical low carbonated, hazy rust color with slight head retention and more legging than lacing. Tastes teeth-hurting sweet with a rich grape, vineous-brandy flavor and strength. Back-up characters found in the aroma are reinforced in the flavor. The power in these flavors are as strong as will be found in any beer, yet very smooth and delicate. The feel is a mouth-numbing alcohol with a light prickle from the carbonation. A late astringency keeps this beer from perfection.

The taste is sweet and finishes with a port like finish. This beer has a definite port note to it, it doesn't quite meld with the beer aspect though. The other cask aged versions where better integrated though. The malty notes of this beer remind me of caramel, lightly toasted biscuits. There is a nice bitterness here in the finish that melds with a slight tannic. There also seems to be some subtle hop notes of pine and a hint of citrus.

In the mouth it's creamy and exceptionally smooth with a full body and lightly tingly,restrained carbonation (but it's not bottle conditioned). Lush, juicy, dripping honeyish malt is accented by low-level notes of grassy hops; and peppered with spicy notes of alcohol. Notes of Port are discernable, but quite restrained. Some woodiness does come through, however; yet it's far from overdone, and it just lends enough character to give it a little life while also helping it to dry out in the finish. It's not overtly complex, but it is exceptionally rich and satiating. Superb!","NeroFiddled","Jan 16, 2005"
2.79,-32.4,2,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Light orange color, no head. Strong red wine emanations capture the nostrils. Fruit syrup (apricot, pears) make up for a powerful liquor flavour. Extremely sweet palate, like apricot juice over an oxidized grape liquor. Syrupy medium body contributes to the cloying aspects.","Rastacouere","Dec 19, 2004"
3.67,-11.1,3.5,4,4,3,3,"A more interesting drink than the regular Harvest Ale 2003. The port-aged variant is a bit rounder, with less sharp initial bitter notes and a *much* better aftertaste. Not the best barley wine I've had, but significantly more palatable than the "plain" Harvest Ale 2003.","dgallina","Oct 11, 2004"
3.13,-24.2,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,2,"Ruby-brown color. Smell isn't as strong as I expected, slightly grapy. Taste is had to describe. Very sweet, sticky, syrupy & sugary. Still a beer, but just barely. More like a liqueur. An interesting experience nonetheless. I'll not try it again though.","benmiliron","Sep 28, 2004"
3.78,-8.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The whiskey in the Lagavulin was subtle, but the port in this one is practically non-existant. This is basically the same sugary and alcoholic beer that the normal JW Lees Harvest Ale is. The clear red gold amber is topped by a small, fleeting white head. There might be the slightest bit of grapes in the finish of this beer. Its a nice barley wine just like the original, but Im not seeing the cask aging having added much to the beer.","aracauna","Jul 28, 2004"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed a 1/8" head over the clear copper brew, with slight lacing. Slightly sweet malt aroma, with fruit and alcohol notes. Taste is of sweet malts, followed by the alcohol warmth, and a discernable fruitiness, which I assume is from the port. Flavor is very complementary to the usual JWLees Harvest. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style. My favorite of the cask-aged Lees.","ppoitras","Beers"
4.87,17.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"This sample was left out on the bar for 10 days, after which it was consumed with great surprise and enthusiasm. The sweetness converted to pure, molten glacial texture and the lack of fizz revealed a spicy, sherry flavor... reminiscent of WIlliams and Humbert's 15 year old solera Dry Sack. Unbelievable!","putnam","0"
4.79,16,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Outstanding beer, wonderful flavor. The only drawback is the heaviness, which would get wearing after two or three, assuming you were still sober.","Afterburner","May 07, 2004"
3.65,-11.6,4,4,3.5,4.5,3,"275ml bottle with black text and a black cap. This one pours a clear deep amber orange color with a decent off white head that quickly falls to a collar. Leaves a sparse lacing around the glass as it is consumed. The aroma had a nice fruity sweetness and a bit of alcohol with the Port flavors present as well. There was also a buttery biscuit and yeasty notes mingling with the sweetness. The taste starts of with a bit of an alcohol bite that is quickly overcome by a huge sweetness, a little too much so in my opinion. There is also a strong buttery flavor to this with a slight nuttiness as well. Mouthfeel is very full and heavy with good carbonation. I feel the drinkability was hurt as the sweetness became too much even with the smaller sized bottle. Overall a good beer though and I shall pick another one up to lay down for a few years.","meathookjones","Beers"
4.37,5.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Backwash: Another example of remarkable craftsmanship, this is a beer that can hold its head high in ANY company. It conjures up visions of the English Borders, roaring fires in massive stone fireplaces,.and a damp dog at ones feet. Likely to improve greatly with further cellaring and well worth the effort to find.","Dantes","0"
