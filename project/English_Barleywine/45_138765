4.33,0.7,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"not a style of beer i usually gravitate towards, but this one is supreme in its class, maybe the best i have had since sucaba, no joke. thanks to thebrewo for procuring this one and bringing it out to me here in colorado. looks the part, super hazy and thick, short khaki foam head settles in a couple minutes, and the aroma just blows my mind. its not the least bit hot, which for this strength is insane, and the bourbon on it is enormous. the vanilla is there, and there is a maple sort of sweetness, but its not over the top. the grain is layered in there beautifully, like some of their other strong beers, it comes in waves and its different in taste and feel from any other. melting toffee, warm vanilla custard, sweet oak, maple candy, golden raisin, dried date, and buttery crumb topping. this beer is amazing, with the bourbon finishing it long and mellow. usually big barleywines arent my thing, but this one is really remarkable. cant say enough about it, and how they continue to impress me each and every time i have a new beer from them. one of the best breweries in the country i have always said, and this is further reinforcement of that notion.","StonedTrippin","Mar 08, 2015"
4.18,-2.8,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a 750ml bottle during a bottle share.  Pours a deep brown purplish color with a full finger of dense creamy tan head. which dissipated quickly leaving a thick out lacing ring throughout the drink.  Aromas of booze, citrus (maybe apple?), bourbon, vanilla and oak.  A nose full.  More like wine than beer.  Tastes of vanilla, oak, caramelized sugars, oak but finishes sweet and boozy.  Definitely apples.  It is dry like a wine.  Very light in the mouth - thin.  Medium carbonation.  Little too dry for my liking but It grew on me.  I only had about 2-3 ounces since it was a bottle share.  Would have liked a full glass to savor and see how it changed as it warmed up.  This one was about 6 months old, aged in a refrigerator.  I would assume it gets better with age but not much.  It was a steep price.  I want to say $22.00 or maybe $23.00.  However, well worth trying.","uvachief","Mar 06, 2015"

Pours murky amber orange brown with a one finger off-white head with some orange hue that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma of bourbon, oak, sweet caramel and toffee, and maybe a hint of green apple that makes me wonder if this thing got some bad bacteria in it.Flavor is sweet caramel vanilla bourbon, toasted marshmallow, toffee, molasses, and just a hint of green flavor that still makes me worry this might turn a little sour at some point. Body is big and rich and bordering on syrupy with very low carbonation. A little more carb would probably help this. Overall a nice barleywine with big sweet characteristics and very smooth bourbon. Nicely done overall, with only small qualms here.","BMMillsy","Feb 18, 2015"

First impressions from looking and smelling the beer might be a bit underwhelming, but after tasting the beer it is clear that this is a gem. The key words I would use to describe this beer are "smooth" and "balanced." Although it has a strong bourbon flavor, it has a beer to match its intensity. The drinking experience is not hampered by either the presence of a spirit in the beer (via the bourbon barrels) or the fact that it is over 13% ABV. I would buy this again and I recommend it.","teromous","Jan 20, 2015"

Its been a while since I have found a beer that really surprised me and that was partially because it did surprise me to find this after not keeping up with the beer scene recently, and being completely preoccupied with work and a newborn to even know this had been released.  What a great surprise on a Friday night and even more so after tasting !","alpinebryant","Nov 07, 2014"

A big creamy, malty, bourbon palate with traces of vanilla, wine and a light spicy fruitcake sweetness that leaves a little stickiness on the lips. Finishes with a balance between the alcohol, bit malt, bourbon and hop bitterness.","pat61","Oct 28, 2014"

4.32,0.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.25,"D:  Highly drinkable considering the 13%+ ABV. This brew reminds me very much of Firestone Walker Double DBA. Very similar flavor profile, but not as sweet, and a better price point. The flavors are delicious and offer a nice BBA profile with other delicious notes of vanilla and fig. Not complex. Just straightforward flavors that pack a delicious punch.","antott0523","Oct 15, 2014"
4.28,-0.5,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"25.4oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brownish red with a 1/4 inch of head. Minimal lacing. Big whiff of bourbon along with butterscotch, vanilla, and oak. Smells great. The taste is much like the aroma. Butterscotch, vanilla and bourbon upfront. A nice oakiness throughout. Lots of alcohol warmth but not overly hot. Some dark cherry notes with maybe a hint of cinnamon. Finishes with the bourbon and oak. Malty with a hint of sweetness. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. This one was pretty pricey, but really good. I look forward to aging one as well. Overall, fantastic.","PicoPapa","Oct 12, 2014"
4.85,12.8,,,,,,"I thought this was an amazing barleywine. The pour was a deep hazel/amber with a tan head that sticks to the glass. The smell was full of heavy flavors. Caramel and dark chocolate and then the alcohol and the wood from the casks shine through in the finish. The taste was forcefull to say the least with flavors of alcohol strong in the beginning and then other flavors like the wood and the hops come through in the end to make a surprisingly refreshing barleywine. Would highly recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 12, 2014"
