4.1,13.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apricot, plum, fig, pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, oak, herbal, grass, light pine, light vanilla, and herbal/yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, earthy hops, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, apricot, plum, fig, pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, oak, herbal, grass, light pine, light vanilla, and herbal/yeast/oak earthiness. Light herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, apricot, plum, fig, pear, apple, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, oak, light pine, light vanilla, and herbal/yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, earthy hops, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast/hop/oak balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oak aged English barelywine style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, earthy hops, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2015"

Review rating is for the fresh Widdershins; the aged one would grade about a half point lower on taste because of the thin finish and effects of oxidation.

3.74,3.9,4,2.5,4,5,4,"I was getting ready to knock this beer for a lot of flaws when I was sampling it fresh out of the fridge, but I have to say warming it up has really let a rather good beer come out. The oak impact is minimal and I believe it is mellowing the hops a bit and possibly fusing the flavors together a bit while adding some tannins and a light but of nutty/earthy over tones in the back ground. Or I’m just crazy and read that in another review and stole it. I’m honestly not sure as this beer has me somewhat perplexed. I saw some Arrogant Bastard like comments, and I have to say I get that. This beer getting near or past 2 years (I just have a 2009 year on here, no month that I see) the hops most likely have faded from sight so this isn’t Bastard, but the malt profile and the presence of the hops certainly does remind me of it in ways though certainly different experiences to drink.","bobhits","Mar 14, 2011"

The head was very slight and did not hang around long enough to make the walk from the kitchen to the living room. There were some hints of malt in the aroma, but they were overpowered by the smell of soured washcloth, dirt (not to be confused with earthiness), and mildew. All of the smells came through in the taste, but the malt gained a little bit of an edge and competed with the sourness. Little if any of the oak came through in the flavor, but there was a touch of hop bitterness, (not what one would expect even from a year old barleywine). The mouthfeel was and astringent and had a slight burn from the alcohol which was not pleasant with the thin body. In my years of drinking, I have only drain-poured two beers, and had I had more than a 4 oz. sample, this would have been a third. I might be willing to try it again in the future if someone else pays.","asnow","0"

Taste is a hint of ripe bananas up front, with a creamy toffee middle, and a dry woody finish. The oak aging is nice, often times it is overdone. There is also a hint of flowery hops in the finish, just enough to balance. Mouthfeel is very creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I would certainly get this again.

Tastes initially sweet and malty with a good hoppy backbone and an oakiness around the edges. Some light and dark fruits wind there way through from time to time.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not into one-trick ponies either, but this finished product combines so many different melodies that it just can't quite carry a tune.","BretSikkink","Jan 20, 2010"

3.96,10,4,3,4.5,4,4,"This was a treat--my first from Left Hand. Pours a nice caramel color with about an inch of tan head that laces nicely as the brew goes along. Smell is a bit lacking, boozy, with some caramel and sweetness. Taste, however, is great, big oaky notes coupled with some grassy hops, sweet caramel, and a bit of booze (but it works in this case). Nice piney burps following... gotta love that. MF is a bit lacking in the creamy department, full bodied and oily, but I would like some more creaminess. I moved through the bomber pretty quick, definitely a nice, enjoyable OA barleywine. Definitely will revisit this.","LordAdmNelson","Oct 10, 2009"

3.88,7.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I was expecting a ton of sweetness with this for some reason. I'm not sure if I noticed that its listed as an American Barleywine but I was expecting much more in line with English. The aroma hints at this, as well. A lot of malt, much more than anything, with raisin and a fig-like character that was reminiscient of doppelbocks. The pour is very nice, a somewhat-cloudy red-orange (the red was surprisingly nice). The flavor is much more bitter than expected, not that theres a tno of hop, but its definitely not just all malt. The wood character is also quite-present and even imparts sort of a dry feeling to the mouth, which is otherwise moderately-bodied. Overall its certainly decent, not the most incredible and I almost wish the flavor would tilt a little more in either direction, either more hop or more malt. The balance between the two allows the oak to take over a little too much.","BirdFlu","Jul 19, 2009"

The aroma is peach and tangelo followed by some chewy malt sweetness, wood notes and just a bit of booze. The taste has bold notes of oak but not too much. Next to the wood are chewy sticky malts, solid pine hop flavor and pine hop bitterness. Yum. The varied notes are well matched creating a pleasing experience.

I'm not really sure though why the oak aged version would actually be weaker then the orginal. This was a real struggle to work through, and generally unpleasant. Warming up made no difference. I wasn't really concerned with drinking beer tonight, so I patiently powered through the first 1/2 for a few hours. I got used to it, sort of, but it just wasn't worth the pain, and I dumped the rest. One of the worst made brews I've had in a long time, I don't think I've liked any of the beers I've had from Left Hand.","ccrida","Nov 30, 2008"
4.3,19.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Found several bottles of the 2004 Vintage stocked in Albuquerque, NM for $3.99 each. This happened on 12/18/08 so that $1 per year- what a deal! Out of the caged bottle this beer was a very cloudy copper color with a tan head. Retained as a skim and laced quite well. The aroma was incredibly pungent and notably sweet, lots of ripe peaches, pears and figs, alcohol esters and heat, hints of wood, and lots of caramel malt. The flavors were smooth, complex and well rounded. It started with a biscuity malt flavor before becoming more rich and sweet, caramel malt, ripened fruit, hints of spices, a slight citrus tanginess and a warming alcohol pleasantness towards the end. The sugars had been well tempered by the wood and age. The carbonation was very soft, partly the age again, the body medium/full and the mouthfeel smooth but a little watery. The years had truly done this one well, it was balanced, smooth, quaffable and rewarding with the punchy alcohol well blended in. Bravo!","thekevlarkid","Nov 11, 2008"
3.27,-9.2,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"A drinkable and very average barley wine. Aroma was so so. Hints of vanilla, oak and sweet malt. Pour was a nice deep murky brown with a thin tan ring for a head. Taste was subdued for a barley wine. Sweet hot malt, with just a hint of oak and a moderate alcohol burn. Decent carbonation. As it warmed a little caramel and toffee came out with the alcohol dominating. Average at best.","HomebrewPgh","Oct 29, 2008"

4.12,14.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a HUGE stiff light yellow head that resists fading. A reasonable amount of lacing left behind. The smell has a really nice complexity to it. Initially I got an earthiness that i wanted to equate to smoky, but as it warms up there is a unique fragrant fruity apricot nature. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is medium-full bodied with a very dry finish. Full flavored, the sweet malty caramel character is secondary to the piny resin hoppiness which lingers on with an earthy smoky texture. An interesting drink with a lot to consider. Recommended.","jjayjaye","May 13, 2008"

The warmer beer tasted much more complex and interesting, but I could not drink much more than a glass this way.","kindacold","Mar 29, 2008"
4.03,11.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"These barleywine blends are interesting because you get the sharp hops that develop up front along with the duller hops that have been around for a while.

4.02,11.7,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"2007 Vintage. 750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. I had a tough time getting the cork out for some reason. Poured a hazy, reddish gold with a couple of fingers of white bubbled head. Pretty good amount of carbonation. Great aroma, lots of fresh piney/citrusy hops. Also some burnt sugar. I didn't get much oak from this. There was a pronounced smokey note. Medium bodied with good amount of hop bitterness. Long, hoppy finish with a little pucker. A little overpriced in my opinion.","homebrewhawk","Mar 25, 2008"
3.93,9.2,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pretty impressive after the initial pour. Two finhger frothy, light amber head but recedes after about five minutes after pouring. Before I take my first sip. Pretty good for a barleywine though. Good bubbling too. Very toasted malt nose. Brown sugar with notes of light and dark fruits mixed with a dash of molasses. Great nose that develops more as it warms. The taste is just like the aroma. Complexity increases with warmth. Hints of toasted pears mix with herbal hnts of tobacco and light maraschino cherries. The mouthfeel is pretty wamr, but not overpowering. Just lets you know that tis beer need to be sipped.","scruffwhor","Beers"

3.75,4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice oak scent laid over a malt bill of pale and crystal malts. The hops are well promounced in the aroma also. The oak scent is mild, yet it blends in well. The taste is decent. It has a toned down flavor. It's not overly malty. The hop bitterness is pronounced as well as the oak character. It's quite dry with a lingering oak taste in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I love the concept of using oak casks. It can really enhance the complexity of certain beer styles. I like the oak in this one, but I'm not in love with the lack of malt presence in the taste. It's seems a little bland and dumbed down.
