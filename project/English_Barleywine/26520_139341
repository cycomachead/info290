4.61,6,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Gorgeous dark amber/ruby body with a frothy off-white head that lingers around. Aroma is sweet, sugary bourbon, figs, with a dash or earthiness and oak. Flavor is fantastic, with candied sugar coming through in big ways. Some dried fig flavors come through too, along with a hint of woody maple. Feel is thick and syrupy with a lingering sugary sweetness and low carbonation. Overall this is a tremendous beer that is rich and satisfying. Lots of candied sugar flavor.","stephenjmoore","Feb 06, 2015"
4.72,8.5,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/12/2014. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an amazing malt/barrel balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class barrel aged barleywine style. All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering.","superspak","Feb 04, 2015"

It's simply dappled with golden hues and not thin so it has a lovely glow to it .  I poured into a small tasting glass , so no head but I do have bubbles that refresh on each tip, spots that cling with alcohol legs and a very thin ring.  My first impression of the nose was almond with the skin of the almond.   Nutty, honey, molasses.  Sweet grain and a lazy bourbon scent.  A touch of vanilla and some decadent  dried dark fruits.  Taste is sumptuous. Not cloying but has an actual lip smacking stickiness to it.  There is caramel and toffee, a honey sweetness over the top of nuts. dried dark fruits give it gaiety and it's like a rich sticky bread with days of sweetness in it.  No heat from alcohol at all this finishes soft and without much carbonation. Positively seductive.","utopiajane","Jan 16, 2015"

3.94,-9.4,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"I did not know at first that this was a barrel aged beer, the aroma suggested barrel aging, the taste confirmed. Though it is a subtle barrel presence. Very deep garnet colored with very little to no head. Some spots cling to the glass. Aroma of stewed fruits, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cherry and a good bit of prunes, brown sugar also presents itself. Taste, sweet, maybe a little too sweet, bordering on cloying. Tastes of cherry and vanilla, toasted oak, and toffee. A little burn on the finish. Slick oily, thick, as stated kind cloying. In the end I would like this a little dryer, perhaps aging this one would be proper. If I see it again, I'd pick one up and cellar it.","pmlondrigan","Jan 11, 2015"

3.99,-8.3,,,,,,"Bottle. Had Baby Maker at a beerfest, it did not resonate with me. Of course I puke up $10 for a 500ml again. I'm an advocate. It pours a deep, dark Amber color with a head that only manifests itself as an outer halo of tan bubbles. Refuses to lace. Nose is strong. Lots of oak and a boozy, wet, cereal aroma. Loads of toffee and caramel. Some dried hay. The flavor is sneakily very approachable. Boozy, oaky and slick. Sweet, dark, ripe fruit. Oaky and sweet, sugary grain and cereal. Raisin and dried apricot. The body is very full. Mild carbonation. Hot, hot heat and a dry finish. Impressed by how quickly the immense sweetness disperses off my palate. Might have to buy another $10 500ml and throw it in my bag of cellar tricks.","VelvetExtract","Dec 13, 2014"

4.38,0.7,,,,,,"O- This, despite the change in recipe, will be compared to babymaker due to the name. Good for this beer though, as it is very drinkable fresh compared to BM, not nearly as boozy. I also look forward to how this ages as it is very reminiscent of a well done english barleywine, just with lager yeast instead of traditional ale.","GonzoHomebrewer","0"
