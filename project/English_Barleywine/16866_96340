It has more complexity and while the base is really good it doesn't seem to quite be able to stand up on its own and for the price it should.  The complexity of this beer is good and the flavors are rock solid though.  This beer is definitely one to sip throughout an evening.","SHODriver","Feb 16, 2015"

A pleasant enough barrel character is present, with vanilla, coconut and overbearing oak. Toffee, burnt caramel and a moderate fruitiness are present on the mid-palate. I can't understate how disappointing the finish is. Boozy, tannic and disappointingly watery, there is very little redeeming about this aspect.. The wateriness alone makes me dump the entire damn thing. There's some lingering floral and coconut present. Medium in body with a slick carbonation, this is rather disappointing.","DefenCorps","Oct 28, 2013"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, wood, and slight metallic aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but the slight metallic aroma I am getting is odd.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 10, 2013"

It doesnt have the overwhelming hops of some of the stronger barleywines out there and can be sipped lightly while enjoying the malt complexities. I think they could even kick this up a notch in abv with how this finished so dry. I'd drink it again.","alpinebryant","Sep 06, 2013"

Nice flavor, following the aroma. A bit of alcohol heat in the finish, but really, the alcohol is well hidden for the most part. A really nice brew to sip and savor.
