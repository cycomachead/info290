4.2,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Got in a trade with TheFugitive. 22 ounce bottle into snifter bottled on 1/17/2014. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, and toast/oaky earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, and toast/oaky earthiness. Slight tannic oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and oak on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and slightly tannic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged English barelywine style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 28, 2015"

The nose is bold and oaky with huge vanilla and sweet caramel malt along with hints of bourbon, dark fruit, toffee, brown sugar, and subtle white pepper.  The taste is even bolder with huge oaky barrel notes along with hints of vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, molasses, coconut, brown sugar, caramel, subtle cocoa, white pepper, and raisins.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with light carbonation, incredible balance, and a nice smooth, warming finish.  Overall, this a bold, flavorful, and hugely drinkable Barley Wine that is right up there with all my favorites in the style.  Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Oct 30, 2014"

Aroma is lots of fruits, figs, toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon. Flavor is sweet rich caramel covered figs with brown sugar, vanilla, tinged of dry oak. The bourbon is here but oh so smooth with very little evidence of the 13% ABV. Silky smooth and thick, rich body with low plus carbonation. Man, this is really good.

4.47,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Straight Jacket pours a dark amber brown, with today's sunshine bringing out some intense red notes. Head is light and soapy and stays in place around the ring of the glass. Aromas are intense and excellent: burnt caramel, oaked dark fruit, and lots of booze. Going in for a sniff never gets old. Taste is sticky sweet vanilla butterscotch and oaked dates. Some nice char and light hops that work against the (very pleasant) sweetness. Mouthfeel was just right: on the lighter/thinner side, but substantial enough to coat the palate. Overall, I could pound this one all night. So rich and tasty. From the taste I would've thought this was an English barley wine, but can see it as a milder Central Waters BA barley wine (in terms of that tart happiness I like in the American style). Ideal drinking environment is dead of winter, next to a fireplace. But a sunny porch on a 65 degree late afternoon will do.","blankenhoney","May 18, 2014"

The nose is a mix of molasses, raisin, bourbony oak that finishes with a hint of ethanol and vanilla as it warms. Similarly, the taste is sticky bourbon barrel goodness - bready malts, well integrated bourbon notes, minimal bitterness/hop character, and lingering caramel. The mouthfeel is impressively drinkable with a medium-full, slightly flat body, rich bourbon flavors, lingering caramel sweetness, minimal bitterness, and a smooth, non-burning boozy finish. This is definitely an impressive BA barleywine, made that much better by its shelf status and availability.","ThePorterSorter","Apr 18, 2014"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, wood, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with brown sugar, toffee, and bourbon flavors on the finish.

Scent is not much to write home about...gonna let it warm up a bit... Okay, I've let it warm up long enough. There is some faint whiskey aroma coming through with nice vanilla notes. Some nice dark fruit aromas. Taste is much more forward than the nose. Initially, great booziness. I'm not gonna lie, I love my BA beers to have some booziness, and this one has it. Nice warmth. Boozy whiskey up front with some vanilla and dark fruit flavors. I'm not positive what kinda barrels this beer was aged in, but you can tell they weren't "top of the line"... which is okay by me. I'm always good for a nice beer aged in Jack barrels or something. There are some definite rye flavors coming in as I taste it more. Was this beer aged in rye whiskey barrels? I should have done my research. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. Drinkability is fairly high...somewhat scary. Overall, this beer is very unique. I'm getting a lot of rye flavors and this is a barleywine. I'm only used to rye BA stouts and whatnot. Very tasty beer!","DovaliHops","Feb 12, 2013"

The smell is very strong and full of malt and bourbon heat. I'm getting some caramel and vanilla notes. The hops lighten up the sweetness a bit. This is pretty easy to drink.","oline73","Feb 03, 2013"

This stuff pours a murky garnet topped by a half-finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises toasted toffee, whiskey, light toasted oak, light cocoa, and candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light ruby red grapefruit rind and a slightly boozy kick. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty enjoyable barrel-aged barleywine. It may not be especially crazy or anything, but I'd definitely have another, no hesitation.","TMoney2591","Dec 24, 2012"

Taste is smooth with an assertive sweet malt profile. Smooth vanilla, toffee, caramel, and marshmallow. A bit of leather and earth finish things off. Smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Overall, the barrel really smooths things out and makes this quite a bit more exciting.","homebrew311","Mar 06, 2012"

4.27,-0.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Wonderful complexity. Richness of flavors play very well together. It's dark murky (almost mud-like) appearance as it cascades in the snifter doesn't do much to make you want to dive right in, and perhaps you shouldn't. This gentle monster improves dramatically as you allow it to warm from serving tank temperature. Refreshing maltiness for a big barleywine. A pleasant departure from the common "Hop the snot out of it" approach to the style. Though I love this beer for it's flavor and complexity, it's drinkability that sets it apart from every other 13%er around. Pound for pound, the easiest drinking big beer in town. Certainly a favorite.","Hopfist","Sep 18, 2011"

4.09,-4.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Feel is sticky, flavors of sweet caramel, vanilla, and toffee flavors dominate. Sweet lingering finish, vanilla from the wood, but not especially boozy. The alcohol does seem to dry out the palate after the sweetness passes. The distinctive dried cherry notes of the base beer have been obliterated by the barrel it seems. Overall this is good, and potent in small doses. Wouldn't want more than one, and then only for dessert.","emerge077","Sep 08, 2011"
3.31,-23,4.5,3.5,3,4,3,"O - One of the more fatiguing beers I've had in a while. So sweet I was ready to call it quits after an ounce, literally. Not that it tastes bad, just way too powerfully sweet and rich. I forced my way through 5 ounces but was rough. Not getting this again at the price.","AgentZero","Beers"
3.7,-14,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - A decent barrel-aged barleywine, but one of Revolutions weaker offerings. I didn't feel the need to order a whole glass of this one. I think I preferred Haymarket's stab at this style to be honest, although it suffered from excessive booze. Wooden Hell, BA Behemoth, and BA Hi-Fi Rye are safe on the podium for the moment.","MasterSki","0"
