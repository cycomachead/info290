Along with it is the rather disjointed base barleywine that's made much much better with the coffee, with the vanilla and coconut pairing well with the fruit and the caramel working nicely with the chocolate. As with Mash, this beer does feel a little watery on the finish, but again, the coffee makes up for it. Medium in body, lightened in part by the appreciable alcohol content, this beer is moderately carbonated. The finish has a blend of coffee, coconut and booze, and, as mentioned earlier, is a touch watery. Solid stuff.","DefenCorps","Nov 06, 2013"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, coffee bean, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody and roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice coffee and bourbon presence that makes this beer better than regular Mash in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 12, 2013"

The aroma is loaded with nutty toffee and coffee. Lots of cashew with some almond in there as well. Ample bourbon with restrained brown sugar. I get a little vanilla and chocolate as well. The coffee cuts the rich English Barleywine aroma. The flavor is smooth with an enormous amount of toffee and a balanced nutty coffee profile. Earth abounds. Bourbon is pervasive and alcohol is very well hidden. Again, the coffee cuts the sweetness, making this dangerously drinkable for the ABV and calories. Oak is evident in the bourbon coffee toffee finish. There's some warming, and the beer is sticky and smooth. This beer is really good and it exceeded my expectations. The coffee is balancing and doesn't blast the base beer into oblivion. I hope The Bruery does a coffee stout next year.","HopHead84","Sep 05, 2013"
