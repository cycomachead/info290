4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cocoa, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cocoa, light coffee, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, dark fruit, cocoa, and light coffee/nuttiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/slick, and slightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English barelywine style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roast/bready malts and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 23, 2014"

4.19,5.8,3.75,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"wow. in my limited exposure to this brewery i am very very impressed, and this barleywine is definitely something special. its darker than most, looks like an old ale, richer deep brown complexion and not much head on it. plenty of viscosity to the feel, slippery and thick, with just a prickle of carbonation. flavors range in grain from dark and roasty to sweet and coppery, then tangy even and a hint smoky, which is to say that its very complex at its base. there is a lingering molasses or honey sweetness to this, and a mineral presence unique to the style. definitely not hoppy, so maybe more in the english tradition, although i dont get much yeast character in here either. i love the slick feel, the lack of alcohol presence which is insane for how big this is, and i love that the grain comes in waves, one after the next so its never muddled or messy. impressive take on the style, i like the darker complexion of this, and think it suits the season well. so cool too to see this pouring in colorado. i enjoyed one at jakes brew bar in littleton last night. go drink it up!","StonedTrippin","Oct 29, 2014"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, brown sugar, raisins/dark fruit, dark bread and a bit of chocolate. It tastes like caramel, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruit (raisins, cherries), bready malt, and some nuttiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and syrupy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good English Style barleywine, I should have bought some more. Definitely worth trying if you're never had it before. $5.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jun 28, 2014"

Nice a malty tastes, little to no taste of hops. Had an awesome creamy feeling. As the beer warmed it got better. I would say it maybe was served too cold to begin with.

Flavor has a bit too much alcohol, but that’s balanced a good bit by the sweetness. Probably also tasted a bit boozy after just having had the ultra-smooth Dark Apparition on cask. Medium, full body. A slow sipper.","Thorpe429","Dec 28, 2012"

3.89,-1.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and a slight coffee aroma. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a medium bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but pretty strong.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 13, 2012"
