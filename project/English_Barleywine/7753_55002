3.97,0.3,4,3.75,4,4.25,4,"2014 release.  Pours a dark brown, just like a porter.  Normal head volume and retention, excellent lacing.  Dark fruit nose of plums, raisins and dates over a light note of alcohol.  As it warms, molasses is evident along with a caramel note..  Light full body with a nice creamy texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation, with a bit of effervescence in the finish, buttresses the body/texture.  The flavor profile is intense, very complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a burst of blended dark fruits that flow into a molasses sweetness.  In the middle, the molasses fades into a caramel note that is rather sweet and covers the alcohol that lurks underneath.  While reasonably covered, the alcohol still exhibits a slight astringency in the middle.  In the finish, alcohol dominates and leaves that nice burn at the back of the throat.  As it all fades away, it is a bit dry and prune notes are detected.  I'm not a big barley wine fan, but this one hits the outstanding mark.","tillmac62","Jan 07, 2015"

4.46,12.6,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This is a well made beer, by one of my favorite local brewers. I may have to grab a few more up to cellar, before they are gone again. One note they have just began the transition to 12/ 6 packs and they have changed the label style. Personally I kind of like the older labels. I noticed the Lindley Park, which was one of their more sought after beers had the wax omitted and I suspect the Event Horizon will too. This may be the last of the, shall I say “reserve” beers from them that has the wax coating around the cap. If that interests you, I doubt next years will have it! (4.5)","humuloner22","Nov 16, 2014"

4.62,16.7,5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"This was a nice purchase from my trip to Asheville, NC, recommended by the good people at Appalachian Vintner. Drinking from an Old Hickory glass, at room temperature, the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, and like a previous reviewer mentioned, has the woody, old ale quality. A little sweet, but definitely not overpowering. Personally I feel it is well balanced, and I very much enjoyed it. Definitely would buy it again if I get a chance to go to NC. Oh yeah, that blue wax covering the bottle top, is interesting, but perhaps a bit too thick for easy removal.","bcheng","Apr 28, 2014"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a reddish copper with two finger head and lace ring down glass. Boozy, alkie aroma with bourbon, wood, hint of vanilla, caramel/sugary goodiness and touches of dark fruits (mostly figs and toffee). Fuller bodied, chewey, pronounced alcohol bite with a touch of burn on backend, this is a slow sipper b/c it will hit you and hit hard. That being said, well balanced, not overpowering in any sense, love the dark fruit and sweetness that balances with the alcohol and wood for a quality barley wine. Would love to see how this ages so I guess I'm buying another bottle.","clayrock81","Apr 27, 2014"

What can I say? I all too often want more hops! It's balanced, and its candied barleyness warms the gut. To its credit, the beer avoids "chalky" and "chemical" despite its big body and 10+ ABV.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hop, sweet alcohol, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, sweet alcohol, caramel, and bitter hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor profile on this one was quite nice and complex. With this being a barleywine, it had all of the flavors one would expect to find in one without a doubt. The aroma was quite nice as well for the style. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance!","thagr81us","Jul 22, 2011"

Nothing much else than that. This is especially apparent in the flavor, which unfortunately tastes mostly like watered-down whiskey and doesn't have malt or other backing. Light to medium body without too much booze, which is fairly impressive. Decent enough overall, but I'd rather stick with some of their other beers.","Thorpe429","Jul 19, 2011"

The nose is a heavy sweetness of caramel and candied sugar. This beer is not as sweet as the nose suggests. Nice dark fruit body (plums, raisins) with some accompanying hoppy bitterness (pine). The caramel and toffee sweetness is definitely still there but more of a supporting role. Well balanced beer with sticky mouthfeel. Overall I thought this was a good beer but it is still a touch hot as it is still 'young'. I would like to get another bottle and open it in 3 years or so...","OakedCanuck","Jun 10, 2011"

4.03,1.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Butterscotch, caramel, a touch of toffee in the nose. Raisin-studded bread pudding comes to mind. A surpsing bitter streak cuts through the smoothish and coating blend of butterscotch, molasses, toffee and fruit. The hops are jacked to a surprising level; this is a beer that very well may respond well to aging. After the swallow, the bitterness calms down and the smoothness returns for the afterparty. Could stand to be a touch more warming, and perhaps with age it would be. Easy recommendation.","PDXHops","May 17, 2011"
